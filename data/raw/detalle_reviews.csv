ChIJu0clrRCIQQ0R00GSTWpDKZQ,5,Dinner start after 8 pm. Honestly best Paella we have had in Madrid. You can tell this is were the locals go!
ChIJu0clrRCIQQ0R00GSTWpDKZQ,4,"Very  tasty food, especially paella. Good service and nice clean restaurant."
ChIJu0clrRCIQQ0R00GSTWpDKZQ,3,Ok... would you pay premium money for good food in a really bad part of town? Let me help you answer that question: service is a not professional Latam sort of ilegal guy.
ChIJu0clrRCIQQ0R00GSTWpDKZQ,4,The experience was great. The food was great
ChIJu0clrRCIQQ0R00GSTWpDKZQ,5,Great food and very friendly staff!
ChIJR08D2YsnQg0RUpRahajdwuw,5,"A very bang for buck colombian buffet! There are long waiting lines since they don't take reservation, so go expecting to wait atleast 30 mins to be seated on weekends. Great empanadas, soups, traditional Colombian drinks and coffee. Definitely a must try it you've got absolutely nothing planned after a heavy lunch"
ChIJR08D2YsnQg0RUpRahajdwuw,5,"Good food if u want to try the typical plates of Colombia. Perfect place with awesome decoration.
A lit expensive. Recommend breakfast with chocolate"
ChIJR08D2YsnQg0RUpRahajdwuw,5,Great atmosphere with a live singer. Thoroughly recommended for lively drink and some empanadas.
ChIJR08D2YsnQg0RUpRahajdwuw,3,"We used to love this place and came many times sometimes even twice a week.. the food was delicious.... But the last couple times we visited we noticed the quality going down. Just recently when we were last there... It was extremely disappointing. They had almost no carne en salsas... Everything was fried, super dry and stale like it had been sitting out for awhile. The only thing worth eating was the empanadas, frijoles and some deserts... Super disappointed as this was our favorite restaurant."
ChIJR08D2YsnQg0RUpRahajdwuw,4,Was in Spain for two weeks and my family took me here. Great place was very clean open. Great food with many choices for people like me that only eat chicken and fish. Certainly going back here on my next trip to Spain.
ChIJPTkT8oonQg0R8e131NHINLw,2,"I always buy vegetables at this stand, from the neighborhood market and with excellent products. But this year I have already had two disappointments, both the black bean and the judion, they have turned out badly, that is, some were just right and others were hard, which I understand is that they mix the new ones with the old ones from the previous year. This is just enough to spoil a meal. Honestly, it seems to me that this is misleading the client."
ChIJPTkT8oonQg0R8e131NHINLw,1,"Deplorable delivery service. The ham arrives 1 month later, I ordered it on December 14 for Christmas and it will arrive on January 10. I was lost and they couldn't give me an explanation or at least send me another one."
ChIJPTkT8oonQg0R8e131NHINLw,5,"Delicatessen with a wide variety of quality products, the hams and the hand cutting are excellent, and they also have services for all types of events."
ChIJPTkT8oonQg0R8e131NHINLw,4,
ChIJfTtWCyCIQQ0RjSvbD-IZ_cY,1,"I made a delivery order that included a dessert called a cup of cream with walnuts. It should be noted that in all the Chinese restaurants where I have eaten they have given me what it is, a cup of whipped cream with caramelized walnuts, and when I have ordered it at home, a taper with whipped cream and caramelized walnuts on the side.
Once I received the order I saw that they had brought me an ice cream with nuts, seeing this I contacted the restaurant so that they could give me a solution, either they would refund my money and come get the product or they would bring me what I had ordered. At the time the lady who works there answered me, I only received screams from her saying that they only had nut ice cream for 4.50, then she decided to hand me over to a person who did speak a little more Spanish to which he told me that was what they had there and that no one had ever complained and that if I had any problem that I should go and make the change to the restaurant but that the problem was not theirs. Then the woman picked up the phone again to continue yelling at me and telling me that that was what they had for 4.50 and they charged me 5.95.
To all of this, I have repeated to him on several occasions, since he has told me that the people who go there have never complained, that I was a regular customer of that restaurant since I had ordered food there on several occasions, and his response was ‚Äúwell, if you have ordered more than 39 times, you will know that here we have cream with nuts like that‚Äù and I told him that it is the first time I have asked for it and he laughed.
It turns out that when you look at their entire dessert menu, it is clearly reflected that they list Ice Cream with Walnuts at 4.50 and the Cup of Cream with Walnuts at 5.95.
The treatment was disastrous and the rest of the food was bland, the lemon chicken tasted stale and tough.
As you can see in the photos, there is the ice cream with walnuts and the glass of cream with walnuts, they charged me 5.95 for the glass of cream with walnuts but they nevertheless brought me the ice cream.
I once again highlight the horrible customer service that these people have.
I will never order here again."
ChIJfTtWCyCIQQ0RjSvbD-IZ_cY,5,"I went to eat with my mother and I loved it. We had gone more times, but now you can see that it is cleaner and with the menu, the dishes are not that big, but for one it is super good, we ordered.
2 menus A
Firsts.
‚úì Chinese salad.           ‚úì Roll
Second
‚úì Rice three delicacies ‚úì Noodles
Third
‚úì chicken with sauce ‚úì meat with peppers

Dessert coffee and ice cream

I loved it I recommend it üòä"
ChIJfTtWCyCIQQ0RjSvbD-IZ_cY,4,"Lunch with my daughters.
Typical neighborhood Chinese restaurant.
3 spring rolls, 2 three delicacies rice, noodles with shrimp, sweet and sour pork, beef with mushrooms and lemon chicken.
Dessert two ice creams and a flan. Wine to drink. ‚Ç¨33 total.
Fast and attentive service, good food, pleasant atmosphere without music luckily.üëç"
ChIJfTtWCyCIQQ0RjSvbD-IZ_cY,5,"I usually order mostly at home. The truth is that the quantities for the price are great, the sweet and sour sauce is like yellow but it is one of the tastiest I have ever tried. The only thing that the meat lacked salt, but nothing that can't be solved! I completely recommend eating or ordering from this restaurant. Although the delivery man was a little unpleasant, they are usually very attentive."
ChIJfTtWCyCIQQ0RjSvbD-IZ_cY,4,"Hello üëã you eat excellent Chinese food, at a good price and abundant, just like its name.....they serve very well......well connected between Carpetana and Carabanchel meters, and buses
I saw it clean and neat
They take home"
ChIJB6AzuSKIQQ0RiIg31sS64Po,5,"Brill!, Francisco makes the best coffee! And the best burrata. And Giuseppe is the best Italian speaking waiter!Giuseppe with the Bulgarian Moto Cross champion!"
ChIJB6AzuSKIQQ0RiIg31sS64Po,5,"Excellent

The best Italian food place you can find in the area, run by authentic Italians. The food is spectacular and has an adequate variety, neither too little nor too much that you don't know what to order.

The menu of the day is also phenomenal, it is well worth eating in this place."
ChIJB6AzuSKIQQ0RiIg31sS64Po,5,"My first visit, not the last. Spectacular. We have tried lasagna, calzzone, a pizza and fresh pasta with seafood. Everything is delicious, for dessert the tiramisu is recommended, it is spectacular. Giuseppe congratulations on your restaurant, it has everything"
ChIJB6AzuSKIQQ0RiIg31sS64Po,1,"I was confident in ordering delivery because of the good comments it had, but we received a sad pizza, almost without dough and with three pieces of mushroom and ham. The calzone arrived flattened and almost without filling. And of course all the food was cold and the taste left a lot to be desired. Paying 39 euros for this seems like a theft to me. It is shameful and regrettable."
ChIJB6AzuSKIQQ0RiIg31sS64Po,5,"Very good dinner! A highly recommended site. We were having dinner and they recommended the gnocchi and truffle stuffed pasta. Both spectacular dishes. We also ordered a barbecue calzone. To finish, we ordered a tiramisu and a pannacotta that were to die for! We ended up very full. They served us super fast and well, we will surely return!"
ChIJ9YcJgyKIQQ0RvFvcsjycTGk,1,I paid for extra pepperoni and this is what I got and I told them no peppers plus it's cold.  I will never be purchasing from them again. And the manager sounded like she hated her life.
ChIJ9YcJgyKIQQ0RvFvcsjycTGk,1,"Terrible service we have ordered multiple times and every time they state 30 minutes... And every time its 1 hour 30 minutes late we even put in for a refund request which for one order never showed up! And we heard nothing back terrible service the people on the phone do not know what they are doing.

We live 15 minutes away....."
ChIJ9YcJgyKIQQ0RvFvcsjycTGk,5,Get it 10 minute
ChIJ9YcJgyKIQQ0RvFvcsjycTGk,3,Nice
ChIJ9YcJgyKIQQ0RvFvcsjycTGk,5,Good
ChIJs3y1EyOIQQ0RChFYzpwZiDQ,5,"Fantastic meal, columbian restaurant with ultra fresh ingredients and interesting recipes. I had the grilled fish and the empanadas.... Highly recommend."
ChIJs3y1EyOIQQ0RChFYzpwZiDQ,5,"We had the set menu for an early meal today and loved it. Good portions, tasty food. They were accommodating and nice with our 2 year old who became a little antsy towards the end. Would definitely go back and recommend to all looking for a good Chinese."
ChIJs3y1EyOIQQ0RChFYzpwZiDQ,5,amazing service and lovely food amazing place
ChIJs3y1EyOIQQ0RChFYzpwZiDQ,5,Good test and good price.
ChIJs3y1EyOIQQ0RChFYzpwZiDQ,5,The best Fried rice in Madrid!
ChIJb_-XcCOIQQ0Ru1EK3Xj4yxo,5,Very good place! Excellent food and super friendly waiter! The delicious pork rinds üëåüèº We will repeat!
ChIJb_-XcCOIQQ0Ru1EK3Xj4yxo,1,"I'm sorry for the negative comment but I didn't like the seasoning at all, starting with the empanadas that we ordered as a starter, an open mess that was overcooked and oily, the rice was over salted, the chop I ordered was bitter not to mention damaged, the flavor was horrible, they changed it to veal and I don't know if it was the kitchen's displeasure of complaining that they put sea salt in excess, the rocks of salt were felt and the veal was inedible, in the aguapanela they don't put lemon, only ice water and a little sweet, needless to say, I'm not that demanding when it comes to eating but unfortunately I don't give it a single star, on the other hand as advice they should do a pest fumigation because there are cockroaches.

The only rating with about 3 stars is the attention of the waiter who was very polite and had good service, but the rest was terrible, even in the payment they made to us, they overcharged us. üò†"
ChIJb_-XcCOIQQ0Ru1EK3Xj4yxo,1,"I am very sad to post this review because the food there is very good, but the delivery service today has been terrible.
We placed an order at 2:50 p.m. and they gave us a 45-minute wait, an hour and a half passed and we called and they told us that in less than 10 minutes we had the order at home. We waited until two hours and called again and they told us that it was in delivery and supposedly they had many orders. We understood and waited. Three hours have passed and nothing has arrived. We waited because they told us it was going to arrive, but if the intention was not to bring it, at least they should tell us and not make us wait so long, but not even that."
ChIJb_-XcCOIQQ0Ru1EK3Xj4yxo,1,"The food was terrible, the rice and the salty broth. We also ordered a valluna chop and it was just the chop with fries, I don't know where you've seen that that's the valluna chop... and the service wasn't very good either..."
ChIJb_-XcCOIQQ0Ru1EK3Xj4yxo,2,"The food is phenomenal 10/10, but wait more than an hour!!! For them to bring it to you a few blocks away damages the entire service, it's a shame."
ChIJg3YXO4onQg0Rgz3d6I04Dcw,5,"Es un sitio singular, muy particular, maravilloso. Espectacularmente atendido por un matrimonio donde se percibe l pasi√≥n por su trabajo en cada detalle. La comida muy elaborada y de calidad superior, la presentaci√≥n maravillosa y los sabores y mezclas sublimes.
Todo esto acompa√±ado de un ambiente cercano y personalizado al m√°ximo. Salimos encantados y volveremos sin duda, con amigos, familia y por supuesto en pareja, como en esta ocasi√≥n. Muy recomendable."
ChIJg3YXO4onQg0Rgz3d6I04Dcw,5,"Spectacular. The restaurant in terms of quality-price is unbeatable. We have eaten the tasting menu and we loved ALL the dishes. A lot of mix of flavors, textures... without a doubt an experience that has surprised us a lot. We will return for sure. 100% recommended!!!!"
ChIJg3YXO4onQg0Rgz3d6I04Dcw,5,"A small site located near the Vistalegre palace. It is advisable to reserve in advance, possibility of choosing suggested dishes with the reservation. They ask before eating if there is anyone with allergy or intolerance problems to edit the menu. Instead of giving the menu, the chef makes recommendations once at the table and it is advisable to go with the flow, it does not fail. A very varied assortment of starters and then a selection of slightly more consistent dishes. The staff is very attentive and constantly attentive to what you need. Good product and very elaborate dishes that justify the slightly high price. We will return to try more variety."
ChIJg3YXO4onQg0Rgz3d6I04Dcw,5,"We really enjoyed the experience. Great service and delicious food. We arrived late for the reservation because a show we were in ended later than planned and they still treated us spectacularly, they waited for us and also gave us a 10-rated service. Without a doubt, we will return!"
ChIJg3YXO4onQg0Rgz3d6I04Dcw,5,"Spectacular!
I'll start by saying that I found this place by chance, we had an event at the Palacio de Vista Alegre and I was looking for a place to eat before, looking on Google I found this one, and the reviews caught my attention, so I called.
At first they told me it was full, but after a while they called me to inform me that there was a cancellation in case I was still interested, so I booked.
When you arrive the place does not attract much attention, it is very small and familiar, but the staff is very friendly and pleasant, the table is very well prepared and you immediately feel at ease.
We let ourselves be carried away by the suggestions of the day, all homemade food prepared by themselves and that changes depending on the day.
Everything was great, very tasty, and very careful with the details.
The price is a little higher than average but it is definitely worth it.
We will return!"
ChIJK8NLkCCIQQ0Riqt_1oUJXHg,4,"Very relaxing, cool AC in the summer, I like the second story, usually less crowded than the ground floor.. and the fact that they have an indoor playground on the -1 floor, is also nice, makes the 2nd story even better and more relaxing.. üòâ"
ChIJK8NLkCCIQQ0Riqt_1oUJXHg,4,Quick order and not too populated.Distance is observed and interior seating condoned off according to rules. Can be recommended fora quick bite if you are in the hood.
ChIJK8NLkCCIQQ0Riqt_1oUJXHg,5,"Everythimg was excellent, great customer service, nice people, great location, confortable table and chair. I will comeback soon. I like having breakfast, lunch and dinner and drink soda in McDonald's."
ChIJK8NLkCCIQQ0Riqt_1oUJXHg,3,"It was nice because they had warm / hot food which is rare in McDonald's, but the atmosphere is very poorly made. The service was great and they helped alot"
ChIJK8NLkCCIQQ0Riqt_1oUJXHg,3,Customer waiting for order without mask. Young teens very noisy and disrespectful. Not sure staff can do much. Staff good.
ChIJY3qCliCIQQ0Rx2jwcVtqZNQ,5,"Best kebab in Madrid, I always come back seriously"
ChIJY3qCliCIQQ0Rx2jwcVtqZNQ,1,Fatal.
ChIJY3qCliCIQQ0Rx2jwcVtqZNQ,5,"The staff are very nice, the prices are crazy, the Quality-Quantity-Price (it seems that you are scamming them because of how good it is and the size of the double d√ºrum for only ‚Ç¨7), and the Kebab is the best in all of Madrid; The meat is delicious, the sauces and vegetables are fresh, and the pitas and breads are amazing."
ChIJY3qCliCIQQ0Rx2jwcVtqZNQ,5,"Very clean place, with air conditioning. The meals we ordered were great, the kebab was delicious, well made, the bread was well toasted and the sauces did not wet the bread to the point of breaking it, like in other kebabs.
The kebab dish was very delicious too.
The girl who serves at noon is very nice, today we came at the last minute for dinner and two boys waited on us, also very attentive and polite.
I have come several times and I have always eaten well and received better service.
Thank you so much"
ChIJY3qCliCIQQ0Rx2jwcVtqZNQ,1,"Two menus of durum and five pieces of chicken have been ordered. The durums were decent, but the chicken pieces were almost inedible. The food made us nauseous after consuming it."
ChIJrR2UeIonQg0RaQZKEblaI3c,4,"It seems to be good. Food quality  is Okey and the cappuccino size is huge. Maybe more menu options or ""free"" composition would be nice."
ChIJrR2UeIonQg0RaQZKEblaI3c,5,"Great, very clean. Friendly staff couldn‚Äôt ask for more"
ChIJrR2UeIonQg0RaQZKEblaI3c,5,Good place to have a quiet chat with friends. And the servers are quite friendly too. Nice!
ChIJrR2UeIonQg0RaQZKEblaI3c,4,I had the chicken and honey mustard focaccia and  it was great. The place is quiet and cozy.
ChIJrR2UeIonQg0RaQZKEblaI3c,5,Delicious sandwichs with the gastronomy of Spain
ChIJB0rQuReIQQ0RTKKmf5KQCiI,3,"Curious place that has a tapas menu where each person chooses theirs for each drink. The tapas are quite good and with a few you will go home eaten. The place has two floors although it is somewhat small. As for tapas, I recommend the hamburger and the fajitas. In summer you can have drinks on its small terrace."
ChIJB0rQuReIQQ0RTKKmf5KQCiI,5,"We met him with a promo from the Boletus app, for which 2 hamburgers and 2 half-liter jugs of beer were ‚Ç¨7.99. Excellent service, very delicious burgers and the place is cool.
It has 2 areas, some tables next to the bar and a chillout area downstairs.
Also for 2 euros you can have a beer and choose from a list of large, quality tapas and toasts, Granada style.
We liked it a lot!"
ChIJB0rQuReIQQ0RTKKmf5KQCiI,1,"The first thing is a pub with siesta music. We went to dinner for some ""maxi"" hamburgers and they served me a tiny, lousy hamburger (the worst I've ever had in my life).
Because of how bad and small it was, we then went to a McDonald's to finish dinner and it tasted delicious.
To make matters worse, instead of putting some potatoes or salad to accompany that poorly made and poor hamburger, THEY PUT US 1 MISERIOUS NACHO CHOPPED INTO A THOUSAND PIECES.
Please, if you don't know how to cook, or work, and don't even want to work (they are only open 2 hours a day, 3 days a week), ask someone who knows how and wants to work for help, or close it.
SHAME!!!!!"
ChIJB0rQuReIQQ0RTKKmf5KQCiI,4,"Cool place, they have a tapas menu to choose from, amber export beer that is delicious and a downstairs where you are very comfortable and at ease."
ChIJB0rQuReIQQ0RTKKmf5KQCiI,4,"a good place to have some beers with a good aperitif (tapa), friendly service, quiet atmosphere, IT IS NOT A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR, it is a place to go with friends and enjoy a good atmosphere."
ChIJBTOd9IonQg0RYysAPP2odOE,5,"Had the carne empanadas and they were the best I've had! They were super tasty and filled with the perfect amount of meat.

The best part was the owner was super nice and very welcoming. You can tell a lot of locals come here because of how he was talking to all the clients. If you're in Madrid, I highly recommend coming here. I know its not in center city, but its a short train ride away."
ChIJBTOd9IonQg0RYysAPP2odOE,4,"Delicious!! I am Colombian and getting empanadas away from home is hard!
Visit them in the Cebada Market!! A taste of home away from home!
Amazing dishes.
They also have a second place in Madrid!"
ChIJBTOd9IonQg0RYysAPP2odOE,4,Love me some 1‚Ç¨ Colombian empanadas.. throw in a Postob√≥n and I'm sold.. üòã
ChIJBTOd9IonQg0RYysAPP2odOE,5,"This small bistro stole my heart. üòäRun by a very friendly, real Colombian who helped us to some great food. Wish we had found it on our first day in Madrid, for we surely would have gone there every day. Thanks and hope to come back to Madrid and to this great ‚ÄòMuseo‚Äô"
ChIJBTOd9IonQg0RYysAPP2odOE,5,Empanada Bolivian was the winner
ChIJR6XykD2IQQ0RUw1ExsE5vG0,5,"The food and service here is incredible! The portions are large, delicious and well priced! ‚Ç¨5.50 for the special house fried rice. I would definitely come here again. They have so many dishes to choose including seafood. They even stayed open slightly longer for us as we finished the food. The actual restaurant isn‚Äôt fancy, but the food and service Definitely makes up for it. I like the simpleness of the restaurant."
ChIJR6XykD2IQQ0RUw1ExsE5vG0,5,This place was amazing. The quality and quantity of the food for the price is exceptional. Would definitely recommend.
ChIJR6XykD2IQQ0RUw1ExsE5vG0,5,üëçüèªgood
ChIJR6XykD2IQQ0RUw1ExsE5vG0,2,"I ordered delivery, the chicken sauce with lemon was acidic, the sweet and sour sauce had lumps, tasted like water and was not liquid. And the dough of the rolls is super chewy, in addition to being full of oil on the bottom."
ChIJR6XykD2IQQ0RUw1ExsE5vG0,4,"I ordered delivery (menu for two people) and I liked the food, they are large portions, well prepared and with good flavor, although it is true that the spring rolls were a little greasy.
The telephone service is very good, a friendly and cordial girl, although unfortunately the same cannot be said about the home employee, quite rude, bordering on rudeness üò†"
ChIJZzwA1z2IQQ0Rx97loDY1yIo,5,The food was very delicious and the waiters were very attentive and friendly. Thank you
ChIJZzwA1z2IQQ0Rx97loDY1yIo,1,"A horrible experience.  When ordering the menu of the day he informs me that the sign displayed does not correspond because he has forgotten to change it, he tells us that already with the drinks served. The paella smelled terrible, we said it and the waiter told us that the rice didn't smell bad, ""if anything, the seafood.""
To which we had to request a different dish.
Some meatballs had a bad taste and when cut into pieces, they had a different color.
Obviously we will not return and we do not recommend it, if you are careful you will not get sick."
ChIJZzwA1z2IQQ0Rx97loDY1yIo,1,"We have ordered a portion of paella to take away, they also give it to you with half a loaf of bread and half a lemon. When we got home we realized that it was bad: stale and stuck rice and smelly meat and seafood. Directly into the trash, because if we eat it we'll still go to the hospital. Unfortunate and quite dangerous. At least we ate the bread."
ChIJZzwA1z2IQQ0Rx97loDY1yIo,5,"One of the best places I've ever been.
Their paella is delicious, and the torrijas...I repeat."
ChIJZzwA1z2IQQ0Rx97loDY1yIo,1,"I went to breakfast and ordered toast with oil and tomato. The olive oil for the toast was in an unlabeled container, we did not know the origin. The waiter was very upset when we asked him about it.
We only drink coffee. We do not consume the toasts.
We were charged for the full breakfast.
We will not return."
ChIJe1P_IvUnQg0RD1qaMeLbo5E,4,Good place for Indian food..
ChIJe1P_IvUnQg0RD1qaMeLbo5E,1,"Little to demand for the price, but even so their attention leaves a lot to be desired, likewise the ""durum"". And I say durum because it was what I intended to eat, I ordered it to take away, when I got home to find a piece of bread with all lettuce. Disappointing. I don't recommend the place, and if you go, pay attention to how they prepare it."
ChIJe1P_IvUnQg0RD1qaMeLbo5E,5,
ChIJmee0CCaIQQ0RmSOyOYB9J-0,5,"Menu del d√≠a is incredible, you eat fantastic food for this small price. Yesterday I ate there the best ""bacalao en horno"" imaginable. For dessert I like their panna cotta a lot."
ChIJmee0CCaIQQ0RmSOyOYB9J-0,5,Eaten here on several occasions and the service is second to none as well as the quality of food and wines. Always visit when on my holidays to Madrid.
ChIJmee0CCaIQQ0RmSOyOYB9J-0,5,Very popular in the area. Gets full during lunch time. Better to book a table before going or you will have to wait in line.
ChIJmee0CCaIQQ0RmSOyOYB9J-0,5,I absolutely love the place. Wonderful menu and wonderful service. Portions are quite sizeable.
ChIJmee0CCaIQQ0RmSOyOYB9J-0,5,Best food ever not the services
ChIJC4d6HB6IQQ0RyVATdPKJDPI,3,Cheap and cheerful. Wide selection of food available. Very quick service.
ChIJC4d6HB6IQQ0RyVATdPKJDPI,4,Ok
ChIJC4d6HB6IQQ0RyVATdPKJDPI,5,"Great atmosphere, super friendly and friendly and the food was very delicious, the octopus especially, it took a while to come out but it was worth it."
ChIJC4d6HB6IQQ0RyVATdPKJDPI,5,"Good portions, well prepared and tasty. Very good squid, tender and homemade meatballs. Good and well-made homemade omelet, red summer beers, well-attended terrace... And everything is well priced! I won't say more"
ChIJC4d6HB6IQQ0RyVATdPKJDPI,5,"We always come here with friends and we love it. The cheapest beers in Madrid and the very cheap, delicious and generous portions. Plus, now with the good weather, the terrace is really cool."
ChIJaYVS2fQnQg0R6XTrR-1ZUa8,1,"I ordered delivery and it arrived cold, but what seems most serious to me is that the pieces of chicken were hardened, other pieces were burnt, the sauce was very watery, the lettuce was stale, the onion was the only thing that was saved, the potatoes were better than the durum.  I won't order again."
ChIJaYVS2fQnQg0R6XTrR-1ZUa8,1,"It is a disgrace of a kebab, that this kebab dish costs ‚Ç¨11, which is a portion for a 5-year-old child. I would never order again from this kebab. You are a shame."
ChIJaYVS2fQnQg0R6XTrR-1ZUa8,1,"Anymore! I ordered 1 falafel durum and Turkish pizza through globo. They call me to say they don't have pizza and I tell them okay, no pizza. They offer me another kebab and I say no. Obviously the payment should have been corrected.
I receive the order (from glovo) and what do I find? Two falafel durum. Cold, watery and with 2 kg of lettuce. Not to mention the fries, which apart from coming cold, were terrible.
The worst Turkish restaurant I have ever tried. I can't explain how it was cold if it took about 20 minutes from when I placed the order until it arrived.
The glovo service is excellent, it must be said."
ChIJaYVS2fQnQg0R6XTrR-1ZUa8,1,"I don't give less stars because there aren't any, ‚Ç¨11 mini 10 centimeter plate, almost empty.
I ordered at home.
The worst thing is that they have no contact number to complain."
ChIJaYVS2fQnQg0R6XTrR-1ZUa8,1,"I just ordered by balloon, the truth is that the delivery man was charming, but the food leaves a lot to be desired.
If you don't want to go hungry, don't order. There were 15 potatoes counted and asking for extra of something so they don't give it to you is giving away the money.
Never again!"
ChIJCYhIuCKIQQ0RHroP85TSwlw,5,"The food is delicious and the waitress is friendly. Further, the price is quite charming!"
ChIJCYhIuCKIQQ0RHroP85TSwlw,5,Excellent service
ChIJCYhIuCKIQQ0RHroP85TSwlw,5,"Mainly to say that it is my favorite Asian food restaurant, I have been going since I was a child, the staff that works there is super close and friendly, the food is super good, I advised ordering the Peking duck, the kubak with shrimp and if you want to go crazy, order the flamed banana for dessert, it is super good, (really
everything is delicious, but those are spectacular, at least for me) it is a place that is usually quite full but that is always a good thing, sometimes you have to wait a little but it is honestly worth it, it is also a very clean place and the service they offer is fast, I definitely recommend it!"
ChIJCYhIuCKIQQ0RHroP85TSwlw,4,"A good restaurant in Aluche. The truth is that good quality-price; With a plate to share and one each you are pretty good (depending on what you eat). They have vegan options and can adapt it. Very nice staff. The place is spacious, being Saturday we did not need to reserve."
ChIJCYhIuCKIQQ0RHroP85TSwlw,1,"Food in poor condition, tasteless and stale. Made three days ago.
We called and they sent a delivery man to check that we hadn't eaten the food.
They took away the bad food after an hour of waiting and half eaten (I hope they don't serve it to anyone else, I don't understand why have a delivery man come to pick up food in bad condition but good), they refunded us for part of the order (miscalculated by the way) and on top of that they charged us for the bag that they took back. what a joy"
ChIJ21EgGDyIQQ0R_Hki-_m6GeM,5,"Very good restaurant, the food is delicious and made with first class ingredients. Staff is nice and friendly. They have seafood, fish and meat specialities but i also loved the dessert."
ChIJ21EgGDyIQQ0R_Hki-_m6GeM,2,"Never seems open in my experience. At noon, we are informed of the different timetable pinned to the door, a little problem about updating, so we left peacefully. But at night we arrived just at 21:00, waited and waited and knocked and knocked, there was no answer at all. Please be polite to avoid girls out waiting in rain for at least 15 minutes without checking. I‚Äôm giving this score out of generosity by keeping reminding myself of the kind smile of a staff working there this noon."
ChIJ21EgGDyIQQ0R_Hki-_m6GeM,5,"One of the best seafood you can get, quality really good, the octopus was super good. Also the waiters are humble. Thanks a lot."
ChIJ21EgGDyIQQ0R_Hki-_m6GeM,5,"About 10 miles outside Madrid center but worth the trip. An amazing place with a nautical theme;
the service is exceptional
and food is wonderful. The menu is extensive. I had grilled
lamb chops,  served with roasted potatoes; delicious."
ChIJ21EgGDyIQQ0R_Hki-_m6GeM,4,Great Food! Great Service! A hidden gem that's been around for years!!
ChIJKZpPYYknQg0Rk5aIvfTJWqI,3,"My partner loved her food. But unfortunately mine was not very pleasant. My bun fell apart from the moment I picked up the burger. Probably from the amount of water and juice it soaked up from the lettuce. Which, for some reason, was at the bottom of the burger?
I don't know - maybe it was just a one off mistake.
Otherwise, a great experience with some tasty drinks! The wine here was some of the best my partner had ever tried and cost very little - 3 large glasses came to around ‚Ç¨7.50."
ChIJKZpPYYknQg0Rk5aIvfTJWqI,4,"Nice place
Good music. The food is okey but a bit xpensive."
ChIJKZpPYYknQg0Rk5aIvfTJWqI,5,"Brilliant men√∫ del d√≠a. Lots of choice and it was delicious. Brilliant service: extremely friendly and helpful. Glad to have found this place so close to my work, will be repeating."
ChIJKZpPYYknQg0Rk5aIvfTJWqI,4,"Not too expensive, with generous portions. Try the ""parrillada de verduras"" and some of their egg pans. Ideal for summertime, when you can sit outside."
ChIJKZpPYYknQg0Rk5aIvfTJWqI,3,"Not bad, but also not good. Service is slow, very slow."
ChIJOYTDEYonQg0Rm0H0F6qXd5k,5,Good people friendly stuff and delicious pizza
ChIJOYTDEYonQg0Rm0H0F6qXd5k,5,Cool
ChIJOYTDEYonQg0Rm0H0F6qXd5k,4,You could sit in at a Domino's. Helpful people. Same pizza in Madrid as at home!
ChIJOYTDEYonQg0Rm0H0F6qXd5k,3,"The best is the promotion, eat & drink all that you want."
ChIJOYTDEYonQg0Rm0H0F6qXd5k,4,"Great pizza, but needs better cleaning"
ChIJDwocnxWIQQ0R0glU-BIhMPM,3,"Just like other times we have been very comfortable, this time it has been unpleasant. They allow smoking with the tent closed, which in addition to not being legal is disgusting. The service is still very good, the food is not bad but I will consider going more times as long as the tent is closed and they continue to allow smoking."
ChIJDwocnxWIQQ0R0glU-BIhMPM,5,"In terms of attention and cleanliness, very good.. in terms of food, it is also recommended.. good presentation of the dish.. and abundant portion of flavor. .. it exceeds the average... menu of the day for less than 12 euros... with first and second drinks and dessert included... the very nice waiter (Honduran).."
ChIJDwocnxWIQQ0R0glU-BIhMPM,5,"I went with a friend to have something to drink and we couldn't stop seeing dirty dishes passing by until we decided on the wings with barbecue sauce. They came with potatoes and the portion was very generous, we couldn't order more because we ended up full. Furthermore, they were very good and the service was also very good, 100% recommended."
ChIJDwocnxWIQQ0R0glU-BIhMPM,4,"The food is very good, I recommend the wings. The treatment by the waiters was also very good. They are very friendly. The only downside, inside the place they had the music at full volume."
ChIJDwocnxWIQQ0R0glU-BIhMPM,1,"We were having something and they only knew how to bring us the bill, when we had not even asked for it with the intention of kicking us out, if they do not know how to manage the tables they have, it is not the customer's problem, a disastrous attitude, on top of that we asked for the complaint form and they also denied it to us"

ChIJy5v49IsnQg0RHqRXGqA50OY,5,Rexomendable
ChIJy5v49IsnQg0RHqRXGqA50OY,5,"The place is good to eat or have a drink. They have good portions and it is not expensive. It is next to the Vista Alegre palace, so it is very good if you go to an event. And the owner is very nice."
ChIJy5v49IsnQg0RHqRXGqA50OY,4,"Quiet place, where you can dine or eat at a good price-quality. It has a terrace and it is very good."
ChIJy5v49IsnQg0RHqRXGqA50OY,1,"They serve wine from open bottles without corks and I saw how the waiter blew his nose behind the bar on the floor, sticking his finger in on one side and blowing his nose to throw the snot on the floor."
ChIJ0auhEiaIQQ0RGFGKGaE3pU4,5,My favourite Chinese restaurant in Madrid
ChIJ0auhEiaIQQ0RGFGKGaE3pU4,5,"My reference Chinese Restaurant in Madrid has been around for a long time and both the food and the size of the portions are very good.

Very good treatment by the waitresses.

Parking in the area, as long as it is not a holiday or long weekend, is relatively easy.

And as I said at the beginning, the food is delicious!!!

Before it was called Oriente City, now with a name, let's say something peculiar, ALFALFA.

When more than 30 years ago many Chinese restaurants began to flourish in Madrid, for me this one has always had the best quality and at a very good price (and I can say that I have tried countless restaurants of this type, it became a tradition to do it with my parents )."
ChIJ0auhEiaIQQ0RGFGKGaE3pU4,5,"First visit and I will definitely return!

The attention of 10, everything impeccable and very rich. For those who love traditional Chinese food, I recommend it 100%."
ChIJ0auhEiaIQQ0RGFGKGaE3pU4,5,"Now it's called Alfalfa and it's phenomenal.
Very good value for money
They have renovated the decoration and tableware and it is a pleasure to eat there. Very good attention."
ChIJ0auhEiaIQQ0RGFGKGaE3pU4,5,"They have recovered their essence with the remodeling of the premises, the dishes of a very good quality at the best price.

It has always been our favorite Asian restaurant. We will return 100%."
ChIJuXGOKyyIQQ0R_Wu9rg4sLrM,5,"You get so much for what you pay for! Their men√∫ del d√≠a costs 12,50‚Ç¨, which includes an appetizer, first course, a long plate of various sushi, and a drink!"
ChIJuXGOKyyIQQ0R_Wu9rg4sLrM,5,"We ordered food from here a couple of times during our vacation and it was always really really good. We tried a variety of dishes and there was not a single one that we did not like! The price was OK and one of the times they gave us a soda and a beer for free, that was really nice. I'm sure we will order again from them when we are back in Madrid and we crave Japanese food."
ChIJuXGOKyyIQQ0R_Wu9rg4sLrM,5,"Pleasantly surprised, good food ,great price ,very attentive and fast service"
ChIJuXGOKyyIQQ0R_Wu9rg4sLrM,5,"The food was freshly made, delicious and the service was exceptional. Worth a trip!"

ChIJfTsa3YsnQg0RcebDSdC7k2M,4,The menu is correct and offers the opportunity to taste a very complete grill of meat accompanied by a drink and dessert. Good attention from the waiters; attentive to everything and agile service.
ChIJOzQGX4knQg0Re3dqSkorC0g,5,"Food and service very good, i wanna go back already!!! That was my last night in Madrid with my love, he enjoyed his burger.!"
ChIJOzQGX4knQg0Re3dqSkorC0g,1,Service wasn't good. Burgers weren't served at the same time and burger wasn't warm.
ChIJOzQGX4knQg0Re3dqSkorC0g,4,"Nice food, very friendly staff and good atmosphere."
ChIJOzQGX4knQg0Re3dqSkorC0g,5,If you like Tgi Friday you give it a shot to this place you won't regret it
ChIJOzQGX4knQg0Re3dqSkorC0g,5,Great environment and great stuff
ChIJBcnYiCKIQQ0RC6750RgMJcY,1,A bar that takes photos of you with your tapas under plastic wrap cannot be good. The tapas are made on the day. They are not stored in plastic.
ChIJBcnYiCKIQQ0RC6750RgMJcY,5,Bar run by very friendly Chinese people with delicious Spanish food and who provide pretty good service. Very nice and friendly
ChIJBcnYiCKIQQ0RC6750RgMJcY,4,The cheapest mug of beer in the neighborhood. Meeting place for regular customers. Lin is friendly and attentive.
ChIJBcnYiCKIQQ0RC6750RgMJcY,5,"Amazing omelette, good mixed dishes

All at a very good price"
ChIJBcnYiCKIQQ0RC6750RgMJcY,4,Good to get out of trouble. The bathroom is horrible.
ChIJGxWmdCOIQQ0RYthkwOTiF-c,2,"The service was a bit slow, but the worst part was the food, we ask for some quesadillas that were ok, but the ‚Äúorejitas asadas‚Äù and gambones apa√±ados were just oil, I felt that I had a put a spoon of fried oil in my mouth. I don‚Äôt really recommend this place specially because they charge you the bread and it‚Äôs not even fresh"

ChIJpTbA7YonQg0R8OyvlEYTEvY,3,"Nice stands with fresh and colorful vegetables, fish, meat and small stand-in cafees"
ChIJpTbA7YonQg0R8OyvlEYTEvY,4,"Lo que queda de lo que fue esta galer√≠a es bueno y se puede elegir entre el pescado la carne el pollo la verdura y mucho m√°s.
Pero debo de mencionar que esta fue una de las mejores galer√≠as de Madrid y lo digo con conocimiento de causa pues fui comercial de alimentaci√≥n y esta galer√≠a estaba siempre a rebosar y con unos precios bastante m√°s caros que las dem√°s.
Hoy en d√≠a no es ni la sombra de lo que era pero afortunadamente sus precios son mucho m√°s bajos y las calidades no han descendido"
ChIJpTbA7YonQg0R8OyvlEYTEvY,4,An appropriate place to purchase fresh food. It is the local market and is well maintained. I was there having breakfast and it was very good
ChIJpTbA7YonQg0R8OyvlEYTEvY,1,"Very bad experience at the FRUTAS CASTILLO fruit stand.
I bought avocados and none of them were good. For the price they have (especially being from a good brand), I expected a much higher quality than the one obtained.
Then they say about foreign stores, but that has never happened to me in any of them.
I feel like I have been robbed, so I will never shop there again."
ChIJpTbA7YonQg0R8OyvlEYTEvY,4,"A food market with all the services at your fingertips. Good fruit shops, butchers, fishmongers or delicatessens at your service, where it is worth being recommended. The ideal place for your purchases."
ChIJk3RR0FSJQQ0RRK4kajQucoo,1,Hands down the worst pizza I ever had. I ordered the Carlos Especial and it tasted like rubber. Also. My partner ordered a second pizza and it took them 35 minutes to make it. I do not like leaving negative reviews but the quality of pizza that I was given is unacceptable and I don‚Äôt plan on ever going back.
ChIJk3RR0FSJQQ0RRK4kajQucoo,4,"Very nice place and good food. Our waitress Noelia was very welcoming and nice.
Would recommend."
ChIJk3RR0FSJQQ0RRK4kajQucoo,3,I just ate the typical pizza. Nothing to say about it! Reasonably good. It' a pizzeria!!!
ChIJk3RR0FSJQQ0RRK4kajQucoo,1,"Terrible service, more than 1 hour and 30 minutes for my order to be delivered.
I call the store and it takes them about 5 minutes to answer me, leaving me on hold the entire time. And to surprise‚Ä¶ The pizza arrives in the following way and is cold‚Ä¶ Unfortunate."
ChIJk3RR0FSJQQ0RRK4kajQucoo,1,"NEFASTO home delivery. I am loyal to the franchise, but this is the second time I have ordered delivery and I receive quantities that are disproportionate to the price of the products. The first time I thought it might be a mistake, but I just received this order and the piece of cake is ridiculous for its cost (in a restaurant I imagine they would be embarrassed to serve this). The same goes for potatoes. A shame, but when I want to consume I will go to another franchise."
ChIJTVN67NeJQQ0RRWBpxVsEXsw,5,"I stopped for a beer on their terrace and saw their tortilla. It looked incredible but I was on bicycle and had already gotten full on their pan con tomate. I went back for lunch this past Saturday and the tortilla did not disappoint. Thick like a slice of cake, soft in the middle with onions... Basically a slice of heaven.

I have no picture to include because that pincho disappeared quickly between the three of us in a warm up to lunch."
ChIJTVN67NeJQQ0RRWBpxVsEXsw,1,"The menu was expensive and the food was really bad, very badly cooked!
They took their time to attend you."
ChIJTVN67NeJQQ0RRWBpxVsEXsw,5,co.
ChIJTVN67NeJQQ0RRWBpxVsEXsw,4,"Daily menu of ‚Ç¨13.50 with 4 starters, 4 seconds and various desserts included. The menu includes a glass of rioja or another wine. Fair amount (I ordered skewer hake and I got 1/4 of the tail...). Good attention. Homemade restaurant atmosphere. See account.
On October 9, 2024 we returned and the staff has changed, similar menu (‚Ç¨13.50) per person, good service from the waiters."
ChIJTVN67NeJQQ0RRWBpxVsEXsw,5,"We celebrated the communion of the children there and the treatment received by both Hellen, Mario and their team has been 10.

From the first day they provided all the facilities in the world, we understood each other very well, and we enjoyed the glazed terrace alone, which is wonderful.

They showed us several menu options, with very good quality.

The service in the room was also phenomenal, so I just have to thank them for making everything so easy for us."
ChIJOYL46yKIQQ0RxQ9GL2O6eUs,5,Home delivery service is epic.They always deliver food fast. Kebabs are tasty. Their special salsas are best.

ChIJgQpkI7yJQQ0RkbH2Of1QJEQ,5,"I booked a table for 7 people to celebrate my birthday because of the good reviews it has and it was a success. The restaurant is small and you are super comfortable, the food is spectacular, everything we ordered was incredible and the waiter was super attentive at all times and with exemplary education, he also helped us in choosing dishes so that we did not order too much food, which we it is much appreciated. The place very clean. We will definitely return, we all left there delighted."
ChIJgQpkI7yJQQ0RkbH2Of1QJEQ,5,"Very good choice, the place is small and super comfortable and quiet, the service is spectacular, the waiter is super attentive at all times and kind to us, there are not many places where they treat you like this. Lastly and obviously most importantly the food, incredibly good. The menu is not very extensive but everything they have is incredible and super homemade (apart from the fact that it is difficult to find these prices in a restaurant today). We will definitely return!!"
ChIJgQpkI7yJQQ0RkbH2Of1QJEQ,5,One of the best pizzas in Madrid! I've been there several times and it never fails.
ChIJgQpkI7yJQQ0RkbH2Of1QJEQ,5,"Brilliant. We came to eat, they treated us very well and the food was very delicious. The risotto stands out for its incredible flavor. It is a small and somewhat hidden place and since there were not many people it was quiet. The cook also came out to say goodbye and make sure the stay had been pleasant. We will return!"

I decided to try something different and the experience has been more than rewarding. It had been a long time since I had an arepa and both the flavor and the presentation were exceptional.

I recommend 100%."
ChIJZ7wIhQ-JQQ0R3jjbv2bMPxI,1,"I have ordered a home delivery and the first thing that the bravas that they put in the Uber Eats photo is false advertising!!! We have been getting frozen fries forever and they charged us for almost ‚Ç¨8, it's a joke!!! Raw teque√±os, the cheese is a block and looks like chewing gum. On top of the 8 they offered per serving, they only brought us 7. In short, I will never order from this establishment again, much less go.  Painful."
ChIJZ7wIhQ-JQQ0R3jjbv2bMPxI,5,"Good service, they have Mahou cubes for ‚Ç¨5. The food is good"

I liked it and was pleasantly surprised. I was passing through the area and looked for it on the Internet.
I wasn't expecting much and it gave me a good feeling.
the food was very good. the guata el seca and the ceviche of the flag are tasty.
The chaulafan was very good, and the tamale as a starter was also tasty.
They have a large living room downstairs for parties. I will return for sure."

ChIJeQHZYBiIQQ0RWPWocSFdyQo,1,"The customer service is very bland, and the tapas expert is conspicuous by his absence, they don't give you anything to snack on even when you drink a poorly made beer (Grifo)."
ChIJeQHZYBiIQQ0RWPWocSFdyQo,1,"1.3‚Ç¨ The infusions, that is if you drink them at the bar, I have not tried to order anything at the table, let alone go out to the ""terrace"" on the street. To me it seemed $$$ very expensive for a neighborhood cafe."
ChIJeQHZYBiIQQ0RWPWocSFdyQo,1,"They have no respect for their neighbors. It doesn't matter Friday, Monday or Tuesday, they are capable of doing karaoke until 2 or 3 in the morning screaming. Any day I'll have to call the police."
ChIJeQHZYBiIQQ0RWPWocSFdyQo,5,"Mr. Sebasti√°n is a 5 Michelin star chef, his efficiency and speed of service is 10 and his know-how and elegance is outside the canons of hospitality."
ChIJeQHZYBiIQQ0RWPWocSFdyQo,5,The best are the Thursday mojitos and the appetizer spring rolls with sweet spicy sauce.
ChIJedi2-iCIQQ0Rw4agK0xlD8I,1,"I put one star because there is no less. DO NOT ENTER. You order a meal like in the photo and they give you something very different. You tell her and the waitress who is Chinese (although the bar doesn't look like it) starts screaming saying that if we don't like it, we should go to the burger. The food is bad, cold and she is very aggressive, insulting me to such a point that we had to call the police, she almost hit us, we got out of a complicated situation at the hospital and on top of that, they treat you badly. It's a scam. AVOID THIS SITE. HORRIBLE I HOPE THEY CLOSE IT WHAT THEY DO THERE IS NOT NORMAL.
Apart from that, THE DIRTY TABLES, BAD LOOKING FOOD, I DON'T KNOW HOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DEDICATE TO THIS AND HAVE THAT LITTLE DESIRE AND THAT CHARACTER AND THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH EVERYTHING WAS.... IT'S DIFFICULT.

If you want to be yelled at and almost hit, eat cold and while you order one thing and they bring you another to eat, this is your place."
ChIJedi2-iCIQQ0Rw4agK0xlD8I,1,"They charge you according to what suits them, it seems that they have rates according to the time you go, not recommended for tapas and the oil is rejected from many fried foods, possibly the food they give you is toxic"
ChIJedi2-iCIQQ0Rw4agK0xlD8I,4,"Cafe-restaurant that is very close to the Carabanchel military hospital and very close to the metro.
They have a menu of the day for the average price in the area and their food is pretty good.
The waiters are nice and serve you quickly.
If you want to have breakfast, I recommend that you order croissants, they have the best croissants in the area, the best! Both natural and grilled, but I recommend it as is, without ironing.
If the weather is good, it has a small terrace and gets the sun."

Cozy, both the premises and the treatment of the employees. Having seen some of the similar places around, I will definitely choose this one."
ChIJedi2-iCIQQ0Rw4agK0xlD8I,1,"I come to make a very important review of this place, the waitress is Dominican, today I went to eat at 4:51 in the afternoon and I ordered calamari, they were cold and seemed to have been made for several days, strong and bad, the flavor was some refried potatoes with hair on the potatoes, he told the girl to take the plate from me because I don't want it because of the hair and how bad it tasted, you tell me that I have to pay for it just as he won't let me leave if I don't pay, he forces me to pay he yells at me and for Shame on me, I paid the ‚Ç¨25. It's not the money, it's the customer treatment, the aggressive way of talking to me and yelling at me, I won't return, the food is terrible and filthy, and the customer service is terrible."
ChIJK1Q3JqmJQQ0RA6cKOkIuhTo,3,Uff
ChIJK1Q3JqmJQQ0RA6cKOkIuhTo,2,"We went to breakfast and ordered two coffees and two grilled croissants, we asked if they could please give us one more jam and after the waitress was not the friendliest, she also charged us for one more jam, which we thought was super cheap.
We helped ourselves, we took it to the table, everything and for one more jam he told us that he charged us extra, nowhere did this ever happen to us... adding to the friendliness that the waitress exuded...
As for breakfast, the croissant was delicious."
ChIJK1Q3JqmJQQ0RA6cKOkIuhTo,1,"I ordered a chicken sandwich, the chicken being acceptable, but the bread was cold and dry - I have a hunch it was from the day before -

I asked one of the waiters to please warm it up for me as it was cold and his haughty and arrogant response was ""the bread doesn't come out of the oven.""

The owner's attitude at all times was correct and cordial, but unfortunate treatment on the part of the other worker.

I wouldn't come back not even in 1,000 years"
ChIJK1Q3JqmJQQ0RA6cKOkIuhTo,5,"The treatment and the waiters are the best. From the moment you walk through the door they are all joy. The food and breakfasts are very good value for money. I return every day without hesitation. Thank you ten, keep it up. üòò"
ChIJK1Q3JqmJQQ0RA6cKOkIuhTo,5,"A truly positive experience, they treat you like family, cold beer and good snacks."

ChIJhafQ7iCIQQ0RbDpS2DRxyJk,1,"I was not happy at all. It took more than an hour to serve us, the waiter was very nice but clumsy and unhygienic, as was the local who did not show much interest. The food was scarce, the only good thing was that the rib was tasty. Anyway, we won't be coming back here again."
ChIJhafQ7iCIQQ0RbDpS2DRxyJk,5,"The food is good, but the best thing without a doubt is the treatment and attention of the girl who serves the tables on the terrace, super friendly and making sure we didn't miss anything. A 100/10 for her :)"
ChIJhafQ7iCIQQ0RbDpS2DRxyJk,3,"I have breakfast there every two to three times I usually go to the hospital.
Neighborhood bar with good service."
ChIJhafQ7iCIQQ0RbDpS2DRxyJk,4,The porras were delicious and the coffee and croissant were not bad. It is shabby and shabby like all those in the area but it gets a little sunshine in the morning in winter.

ChIJH704wCCIQQ0RQjF1uqZfWco,1,"There is no worse stingier restaurant to go to eat, the sandwich is very lacking in meat, a little more and it is a lettuce kebab. Very bad experience. Good luck if you go, for my part I won't be coming back."

ChIJi-zfWCOIQQ0Rnq4UQRLF7oU,5,Good place to eat with homemade food. Economical menu of the day and good customer service. The drawback perhaps is that it is not very big and does not have a terrace.
ChIJi-zfWCOIQQ0Rnq4UQRLF7oU,3,"The lady behind the bar had the wrong profession. He must have studied journalism and dedicated himself to the world of gossip and gossip. A professional who is behind a bar has to be aware of what customers are drinking, snacks placed, etc. The rest of the employees are good, the food is good, cleaning is good, etc."
ChIJi-zfWCOIQQ0Rnq4UQRLF7oU,2,"The lady behind the bar is not suitable for that position. He should have dedicated himself to the world of gossip and gossip. He doesn't even know the number of drinks you had, nor is he aware of whether he gave you an appetizer or not. On the contrary, the man in the kitchen is a great professional as is the girl who waits on the tables.
To be behind a bar you have to pay attention to the customer, if you gave them an appetizer, how many drinks they had, etc.
I will not return because of this lady."
ChIJi-zfWCOIQQ0Rnq4UQRLF7oU,5,"Good treatment... Good prices... Very tasty appetizers... in general a place where you have to go no matter what, expanded, clean and fast and friendly service!"
ChIJC7E7eyCIQQ0R4NVIwIVaxQM,5,"I was surprised to find this restaurant again, which has been ""drifting"" for a few years. Now, after a month with the new management, I have rediscovered a great place to eat a set menu: delicious, varied and abundant. Without a doubt, we will repeat. It's worth it. I recommend it."
ChIJC7E7eyCIQQ0R4NVIwIVaxQM,1,"Yesterday we went to eat a 20 euro weekend menu.  The first salad was very very scarce and the croquettes were super although the guy said they were homemade. The second one was saved a little although the sea bass were mini and the entrec√¥te was one for two people. The desserts are worth it. All industrial although he told us they were homemade. I won't go again. I went several times with the former owners and it was a good place. With these new ones it's a shame. To make matters worse, he told us that if we didn't pay him in cash there would be no shots. Very very ugly details."
ChIJC7E7eyCIQQ0R4NVIwIVaxQM,1,"A shame, we ate there, amid noises from the bar....a starter with a spoon on a bottomless and semi-cold plate and a second full of fries with a misnamed pork tenderloin that was very dry from the grill... ..it looked like chewing gum. I came home to eat 2 yogurts because of the food shortage. I won't be back. One and no more Saint Thomas from Here Noooo."
ChIJC7E7eyCIQQ0R4NVIwIVaxQM,3,"Classic bar, it's decent because all the drinks are ‚Ç¨2.8 and they give you tapas. The bad thing is that they only accept cash payment."
ChIJC7E7eyCIQQ0R4NVIwIVaxQM,5,"We went because several people had recommended them to us and the truth is that we loved it. The waiter was very fast and attentive to anything we might need. The food was delicious and the portions were very generous and to top it off the price seemed very good to us as well. From now on it will become one of our regular stops. We ordered some bravas and one ear. By the way, we didn't get to take a photo of how quickly we attacked the dish because it looked so good."
ChIJazRhF4wnQg0RlYoSfibKTlQ,5,"Food is tasty, cheap and abundant. I hope they keep it that way and even better."
ChIJazRhF4wnQg0RlYoSfibKTlQ,4,Top
ChIJazRhF4wnQg0RlYoSfibKTlQ,5,nice
ChIJazRhF4wnQg0RlYoSfibKTlQ,4,"Great option for Asian food. Although it has sushi in the name, I recommend eating the Chinese food menu they have.

The food is delicious, the saltiness is very pleasant, the chicken is very soft, everything is very tasty and of good quality.

It didn't take long to serve us either and the staff was diligent and professional.

As for the space and the atmosphere, here there is room for improvement, the space is ugly, white walls without decoration, there is a large television with the news instead of background music to liven up the food and the bathroom smells bad.

The location is good, as is the access. Still, it is highly recommended because the food was really good."
ChIJazRhF4wnQg0RlYoSfibKTlQ,5,Super awesome! I came to Spain from Italy and was taken care of warmly and thoughtfully by my compatriots! And the most important thing is that the dishes are of high quality and low price!

we ate it before...."
ChIJEzpOEpInQg0Rrez6TlxoUFs,4,"Nice pizza! One of the best in Madrid. There's a garlic sauce in the side, & it's tasty. Can't recommend enough! Love the place too, not too crowded, friendly staff & clean area."
ChIJEzpOEpInQg0Rrez6TlxoUFs,1,They didnt want to accept the offer of 7.99 because he sais we are *short staffed* he adviced us tu pay the normal price so he can serve us

ChIJmzasG5MnQg0RE48dJGN-Z5s,5,"I was treated with excellent customer service. Food was delicious, I asked what was recommended and I ordered bandeja paisa. The best Latino food I‚Äôve ever tried."
ChIJmzasG5MnQg0RE48dJGN-Z5s,4,"The food is delicious and well presented, sometimes it takes a little longer than normal but everything is delicious, in general it is quite good, it is a little cold at the top. They usually have a menu that comes with a starter, main course and dessert with your drink."
ChIJmzasG5MnQg0RE48dJGN-Z5s,5,"The restaurant itself is located on the first floor of a building without an elevator, so a person with a disability will not be able to access it. On the ground floor there is a bar with a few tables. It is not a very big place and the decoration is not excessive either, it is a place where you will eat delicious food. They have a menu of the day for ‚Ç¨12 and a la carte. We ordered tray paisa and it was very delicious as was the menu of the day that included sancocho. Attentive and correct service."
ChIJ8bidvJMnQg0RfcPdDogou-Y,5,"Good wine, delicious tapas (especially the bravas) and excellent service."

Incredible Spanish and Latin fusion food. We came super tired from work and we were surprised by their food. The best appetizers in my neighborhood of Porto. Thank you very much and hugs to them."
ChIJ8bidvJMnQg0RfcPdDogou-Y,5,"Good bar, worth what you order, worth what it costs, enjoy the food, enjoy the drink, enjoy the tapas.
In short, go to this bar, with 2 thirds you get eaten"
ChIJIfMsH40nQg0RiKDqGdZ9F70,4,"A really great place to eat!

If you're reading this review because it's in English then I'll assume that you're not from Madrid. You'll find that this is quite a genuine Spanish eatery, filled with locals eating real Spanish food. The food itself may not be the best (it's still good, don't worry) but it has character (like the joint) and the staff are very down to earth. They looked after us very well since they knew that we didn't speak Spanish. I'd highly recommend the racionales. Loved my time there."
ChIJIfMsH40nQg0RiKDqGdZ9F70,5,Great place. I hope will be there.

ChIJte2eqpEnQg0RHolN1faBMJY,5,"One of the best places you can go to buy, the goods are of very good quality and at a very good price and the treatment is great.  I'm not from that neighborhood and I go there on purpose, they have a specific genre for people who want to take better care of themselves or who lead a more ""fitness"" lifestyle. There is also home delivery and orders to pick up in store!"
ChIJte2eqpEnQg0RHolN1faBMJY,1,"It was a cheap place to buy chicken, but for some time now the prices have been rising quite a bit as a result of its success. The reality is that it has a good genre, but currently the competition has much cheaper prices, some even half as much as theirs with a genre that has nothing to envy of theirs... Ex: in the old way "" The new market‚Äù in Camino Viejo de Leganes, 6, which was renovated and has very good prices and quite good quality or Poller√≠a in the commercial gallery on Laguna Street, which are the same as in the commercial gallery in Camino Viejo de Leganes.
If their prices go back to what they were and the quality does not go down, they will recover another customer."
ChIJte2eqpEnQg0RHolN1faBMJY,5,"the cheapest prices there are. The eggs are excellent and always fresh. The breast is good, it seems to me that it has a lot of water and when cooked it shrinks but for the price it is very good."
ChIJte2eqpEnQg0RHolN1faBMJY,2,"I bought two steaks for this New Year's Eve and I didn't like the look of them. They looked very good but then they're not worth the meat, it felt like a ball in my mouth."

ChIJbb7ZOo0nQg0RgzoDFA4sTK8,5,Good meal
ChIJbb7ZOo0nQg0RgzoDFA4sTK8,4,"Evaluating Chinese food from Carabanchel part 2.

Super good!! The noodles are delicious, with beef and pieces of high quality prawn, not the fat plastic ones typical of a normal Chinese restaurant.

The rice was a little bland but good ingredients and a very good sweet and sour sauce fixes it. I will try the meat and other dishes again.

They were quite nice and fast. I bought it there but I don't know if they deliver. And card payment is accepted."
ChIJbb7ZOo0nQg0RgzoDFA4sTK8,5,"A great surprise, since we discovered it we repeat whenever we can!

The food is incredibly delicious, quite affordable and always feels fresh. The dumplings stole my heart, they are the best I have had in any other Asian restaurant üòç The service is very good and fast. The chaufa rice is also TOPPPP!! Highly recommended for anyone who wants Chinese food that feels like home"

The servings of each dish was large and very filling. The staff was very attentive and friendly, feels very homely here. They don‚Äôt accept cards though, so if you come here make sure to bring some cash."
ChIJtX-EOpInQg0RuwlPdgmB0mA,5,"Very warming ambiance, good food, good price and a nice service.

A bit of waiting but i worth it!

The quantity are generous"
ChIJtX-EOpInQg0RuwlPdgmB0mA,5,"Very charming local place. Friday evening we came around 8 it was empty, until 10pm it was completely full and atmosphere was amazing! Service top class with full attention. Spanish classic"
ChIJtX-EOpInQg0RuwlPdgmB0mA,5,"My family and I went to have lunch for the 12th of October, and we had a really nice lunch. There was a festive menu with many options, and they all were amazing. The menu was priced fairly (it was a festive day, after all) so we had a very good time. This is not the first time we come here to celebrate events and each time it has been amazing. They also put plates with sweets for dessert for free, which was very appreciated."
ChIJtX-EOpInQg0RuwlPdgmB0mA,5,"This restaurant has the best dishes of Galicia in Madrid! I love the food here, the service was a little complicated because was very ground that day and I was alone but they treat me very well, give me a chupito from the house and I even take the filloas LOVE them!"
ChIJC1z4E4snQg0RDV9IkiU_fPM,1,It is not a Chinese restaurant. It's Latin food

ChIJC1z4E4snQg0RDV9IkiU_fPM,5,
ChIJvdGD74snQg0RFSnpu6ZLVLk,1,"Prices are very high. One has to be careful, because they charge whatever they feel like because of the weight of the grilled meet. They are Bulgarians and the so called Romanian food is awful. ""Ciorba de burta"" aka tripe soup was tasteless, small portion and costs 8 euros. A pint of beer is 4,50 Euro. They are gangsters who will scam you if you dont speak Spanish or Bulgarian. I asked for one portion of "" mititei"" but brought 2 portions, and had to pay for both of course. Before we ordered staff put some sort of old cold chicken legs (2) tapa on table. I thought how nice, but then it was added to the bill. I wondered why on a Saturday late afternoon was no other guest. Now I see why."
ChIJvdGD74snQg0RFSnpu6ZLVLk,5,"Bulgarian and Romanian food. Mediterranean style, with fresh vegetables and excellent meat. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, and the cooking techniques. We strongly recommend the Hungarian bread with cheese, any salad (how can a simple salad taste so wonderful) and the ""Sach"" of vegetables (even if you do not like vegetables); the cookies cake is the perfect dessert for such a great meal."
ChIJvdGD74snQg0RFSnpu6ZLVLk,5,Good food and nice attention!
ChIJvdGD74snQg0RFSnpu6ZLVLk,5,The food is tasty and not so expensive. Big portions.
ChIJvdGD74snQg0RFSnpu6ZLVLk,1,No too good
ChIJn-uk4IsnQg0RAuEOD1YHeoQ,5,Great service and very welcoming. The chicken bocadillo was great! We will return when next in Madrid. Parking not a problem if you park in El Corte ingles
ChIJn-uk4IsnQg0RAuEOD1YHeoQ,5,The tasca that always receives you with a smile and your preferred tapa and drink. Great service and personal attention. During the nights and after a concern in Vista Alegre IS also the place to go for some  drinks.
ChIJn-uk4IsnQg0RAuEOD1YHeoQ,5,"Hey... Gilbertito Santa Rosa... you are the best Salsero in the barrio. I really enjoyed hanging out at the taberna while checking out the Vista Alegre neighborhood. Love it. And ""I will be back"". Many many thank yous."

ChIJn-uk4IsnQg0RAuEOD1YHeoQ,3,"It saves you time if you are at the Joyful Palace for an event. It is not a very high quality of sandwiches/tapas and fried foods, but they go VERY fast and for work. If you are short on time and want to fill your stomach, it is a good option."
ChIJMZ9mbQcnQg0RMAvItFEqeVk,3,The kind gentleman. But the mixed sandwich was average. And it's the first time that I don't like salte√±a without spice at all. The place is very nice decorated and clean.

Back today, 12/19, another girl with a bad face, not even saying hello, we left without ordering because of that. It's a pity for the place, we always came for La Salte√±a but because of that I don't think we will return"
ChIJMZ9mbQcnQg0RMAvItFEqeVk,5,Good room and quite clean and tidy. Very good table service. Kind and friendly staff. One hundred x one hundred recommended. To put a but...the coffee weak and watered down

ChIJMZ9mbQcnQg0RMAvItFEqeVk,1,"They serve you very poorly, they don't give you any attention, the pastries leave something to be desired, the atmosphere is neutral, decoration like any cafeteria, I gave you three opportunities to like the food, but if they serve you so badly, then the food feels like that too, terrible service"
ChIJiQJ_CYsnQg0RFa4zhabeflE,4,A quiet place to have an affordable beer or soft drink. I recommend the cheese loin.
ChIJm3zRHcUnQg0RUkr2ecZm-zY,3,"First of all, congratulate the great entrepreneur Gata Manaba, it has been an honor to be able to visit her and get to know her after so long.
It seems like a familiar and friendly restaurant, they try to take you to Ecuador, but for me the fault is the music, we are used to the hustle and bustle and the music was very low.
The food does not stand out in Ecuadorian gastronomy, it should improve a lot, giving it the Ecuadorian touch that represents us to have a good quality of food.
To continue improving, I will return."
ChIJm3zRHcUnQg0RUkr2ecZm-zY,5,"Delicious food, friendly service. I've only had breakfast twice, and it tasted good. There is still more to taste, it will be soon. Perhaps the very high volume of the music is the only ""but""."
ChIJm3zRHcUnQg0RUkr2ecZm-zY,5,"I have gone many times for the daily menu during the week and for breakfast on the weekends. The best encebollado and the fish bun on the weekends is incredible. The food is very delicious, especially coastal."
ChIJm3zRHcUnQg0RUkr2ecZm-zY,4,"The food is very tasty and its value for money is very good. I especially recommend it to lovers of Ecuadorian coastal gastronomy, at the moment you will not find a variety of mountain dishes except for the fritada, which is delicious. Another thing I recommend is to reserve your table because the place is small and there is a waiting line. Its staff and owner are very friendly and attentive. I recommend it üëç üëåüòãüòãü•òüç∞üëèüëè"
ChIJm3zRHcUnQg0RUkr2ecZm-zY,1,"The onion was more or less, Bolon horrible, all stiff, it seems that they prepare them in previous days and freeze them, you can tell when the food is fresh, I ordered a bun, that looked like a black sweet potato cake and its consistency was like a stone, with a terrible flavor, the Quacker for a change was damaged, how can you not realize what they sell, the food is terrible and they are manabas, but the food is terrible, in particular I would not return because it is not worth it, I also say this because of the price, too much and it's not worth it."

No for ever all as a disaster, Im coming and seeing everyone is busy ,I realized no one would ask me so I asked for waiter,but waiter had no anything feedback , great.Next, I ordered the food, and when it started, I found plate chicken so dry and salty üò≠, Jess I ate everything to save the money but I won't be back."

It is without a doubt one of my favorite places when I want to eat roast chicken!"
ChIJdQXmfosnQg0R6NyazwFS1Cc,1,"To say disgusting is an understatement!!! Dirty place, deplorable attention, poorly educated, edges. If you ask for ice, they don't have any non-alcoholic beer either, and if you tell them that the dishes get cold because they bring them all at the same time, they tell you that this place is for eating quickly and leaving. Better not to mention the bathrooms...in front of the door they have bags of onions, and things there next to the bathroom. I don't even want to think about what they will be like in the kitchen with food hygiene. Better not to go because apart from being unfriendly you can catch anything. ü§Æ"

ChIJI1a8rz8nQg0R8Qz7mlrjkfk,4,"I went for lunch in March 2023. Currently the meal of the day costs ‚Ç¨10.50 and includes a first plate, second plate, drink and dessert. I chose the ceviche for the first plate,  aji de gallina for the second plate, and the chocolate cake for dessert. I thought all of it was good."
ChIJI1a8rz8nQg0R8Qz7mlrjkfk,5,"An authentic discovery near Vistalegre. The leche de tigre was spectacular, just the right amount of spiciness and with some delicious chicharronea of ‚Äã‚Äãfish, fried just right.

The ceviche was wonderful. Large quantity at a good price and with authentic traditional flavor. The duck was good, with plenty of garnish.

I can't put a single fault. They treated us fantastically and everything was 10. We will return."
ChIJI1a8rz8nQg0R8Qz7mlrjkfk,2,"According to Google it is open until 11:00 p.m., when I arrived it was almost empty, so I went in to see what they had, they had 3 dishes left. I ordered the aj√≠ de gallina. It was warm, they reheated it and it was a little better, the taste was not bad but the sauce was very watery and there was almost no chicken. It looked well served but it was just plain looking. I wouldn't return!"
ChIJI1a8rz8nQg0R8Qz7mlrjkfk,5,"Good food, affordable prices, pleasant atmosphere when I was there, attentive staff, a Peruvian restaurant with just the right variety. I recommend it."
ChIJI1a8rz8nQg0R8Qz7mlrjkfk,1,"The service was good, but the food was terrible...we ordered 3 broster chickens and it didn't taste or look like what I ordered. The chicken seemed cooked and in relation to the price it was very exaggerated with what they gave me and the potatoes were refried from a bag...the ceviche was terrible and the fish chicharr√≥n that accompanied it was not at all crunchy and had a terrible taste...I wouldn't return because of the bad experience...p.s..they didn't tell me anything and at the time of paying we couldn't do it with a card...I wouldn't.

In general, the food was delicious, showing the authentic Honduran seasoning and the freshness of the ingredients, aspects that we valued positively.

ChIJ_0gCYSQnQg0RrVw9y_R7WH0,4,"Wonderful discovery, we were hungry and this place found us, the staff was very friendly, they should improve the cleaning of the dishes and the restaurant in general, our glass and cutlery were dirty, but they changed it for us immediately.

ChIJ_0gCYSQnQg0RrVw9y_R7WH0,3,"Going to another well-known and very good place without knowing that it was closed, while walking I found this new place, an Ecuadorian restaurant. The menu has normal prices for the current situation... I ordered encebollado which lacked mint for the preparation of the base, a regular one, the second I ordered a chaulafan, the rice taste very good but ""the pork"" a bit strong , as if it had been prepared before in water or in the oven... The egg omelette apart from the rice mixture... Something strange... the peas were hard and the prize was a piece of kitchen twine. I don't know what they put it there for.... The attention is 5/10, food 6/10, local 8/10, take into account the air of the room. wait for the second one and they don't go in order of arrival. In the end. I hope they show improvements next time."
ChIJ_0gCYSQnQg0RrVw9y_R7WH0,1,"We went for the first time and it will be the last, the food was bland and tasteless. How Ecuadorians know when a meal is well made and these dishes give a lot to be desired, expensive prices for the quality of the dishes. Not recommended."

ChIJP70GdLonQg0Rpcp0qswhMW8,1,"The unpleasant attention. 3 days in the same week I went at different times (4:00 p.m.-8:00 p.m.-9:30 p.m.) and they never have fruits, only two to choose from and on top of that they are sour. With half an hour left before closing I can understand it, but at 4:00 p.m. not wanting to cut more fruit seems terrible to me.  On top of that there are more people in line.
I decided to go to the competition (Summy) and the person who served did not bother to cut the fruit on the spot in order to offer good service."

When I got home I weighed the container that was supposed to be made of 0.5 liters and my surprise was that it weighed 250 grams with the lid and carton and 240 grams without the lid and carton. I know the density of the ice cream and by doing the math I was missing more than 125ml of product. I don't think it's acceptable that you order 500ml of ice cream and they serve you 375ml or even less, discounting the cork. They aren't exactly cheap and ""stealing"" 25% of the total amount paid for the product honestly seems shameful to me."

The Russian salad? I feel stomachache, full of mayonnaise on top, which made the one I tried in Sevilla was a heaven.

ChIJwXyYMZEnQg0Rb9hEHqaxtO8,5,"Neighborhood bar with its traditional portions, very well made and with attention that is pleasing as you enter. They are friendly, attentive and fast and they also have many details with both the little ones and the older ones.
We tried the famous ear and some more portions in addition to the free tapas that they give you with the drink. Well pulled rods and good atmosphere.
Highly recommended!"
ChIJp5yXPZUnQg0RCkzjW-TmHUk,5,"If visiting Madrid and want to have a local taste, amazing customer service and awesome atmosphere, I would definitely suggest to visit this restaurant. Another good point, as this is an authentic Spanish local, we have had to learn a bit of Spanish and use google translate, a very fast and effective way to learn a language when you are hungryü§£. From seafood to meat, from Sangria to beer, everything was perfect. The server was super thoughtful and tried at his best to help us with choices and really cared of what we think about food and service. The tomato salad with tuna still says in our headü•∞. All the thanks to your Restaurant and good luck going forward!!"
ChIJp5yXPZUnQg0RCkzjW-TmHUk,5,"We ate there this Sunday, we were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and service. We ordered steamed mussels, quite large with a lot of flavor, the octopus, a must to repeat again and again, very well done and the lamb chops very delicious. Very pleasant service and house shot included! We will return!"
ChIJp5yXPZUnQg0RCkzjW-TmHUk,5,"Very good experience, very good food, impeccable service"
ChIJp5yXPZUnQg0RCkzjW-TmHUk,5,"Exceptional venue, friendly and helpful staff even if with linguistic differences, quality food perfect to share with friends. Our favorite dishes were the lamb ribs, the tuna and tomato, and the beef fillet with fantastic fried potatoes. Excellent value for money."
ChIJp5yXPZUnQg0RCkzjW-TmHUk,5,"Birthday celebration and everything of 10.
The first quality genre. The luxury atmosphere and the treatment they give you are spectacular. Earrings at all times.
The mushrooms, scallops, squid, monkfish and meat are a spectacle.
The tomato with belly is one of the best you can try. And we ordered some ol√© glass prawns.
Thanks guys for putting up with us."
ChIJaeBlaJUnQg0RFZm456XixPE,5,Friendly atmosphere in an old-time place in Madrid.

ChIJaeBlaJUnQg0RFZm456XixPE,4,"Very delicious food. Tasty portions and good menus all at a good price.
The service is fast, especially if it is not a menu of the day. Advisable."
ChIJaeBlaJUnQg0RFZm456XixPE,4,"Restaurant that offers daily menus at different prices.
We ordered the ‚Ç¨13 menu and the food was very very good and very well prepared.
It is a clean neighborhood restaurant with large tables with two very clean cloth tablecloths.
They worried several times to know if everything was okay with great kindness on the part of the owner and the waiters.
We were surprised by the quality-price ratio.
We ate mushrooms with stroganof sauce, seafood soup for starters, and Rioja-style cod for the main course, and flamenco-style eggs. For dessert, rice pudding was also exquisite.
Everything was very good.
It is very close to the San Isidro market in Carabanchel.
My wife and I went to eat and we will definitely return. You don't have to pay a lot to eat well.
They accept gourmet checks."

ChIJdbqgS5UnQg0R2sOL5Cpygk0,5,"Honestly I had only been there once 1 year ago and it didn't catch my attention. But I was very wrong, the breads and sweets are very very good. And the best of all is that they have a wide variety of sweets, and the prices are attractive, but they attract much more the attention of the lady who serves, who is very friendly and gives a warm welcome. In short, it is a great bakery and there is no comparison to others I have tried, I hope they continue like this!!!!!"
ChIJdbqgS5UnQg0R2sOL5Cpygk0,1,"It's the first time I shop there but I honestly wouldn't go back. The lady who helped me was very friendly but cake is disappointing.
It was a celebration for my mom and when I cut it, it had patches and without any filling. Rather dry sponge cake with hardly any flavor.
I simply hope that they improve; those details are what make the differences."
ChIJdbqgS5UnQg0R2sOL5Cpygk0,5,I love a pastry shop that smells like a traditional oven. You can tell that it is baked every day. Delicious cakes and empanadas totally recommended!!

The beer had ice chunks, way too cold.
Way overpriced. Not worth it, definitely avoid the spot."

ChIJo1vdm-onQg0RuPD8i5LaEWQ,1,Accepted my delivery order at midnight but it never delivered‚Ä¶ Why accept order if you close at 00:30
ChIJo1vdm-onQg0RuPD8i5LaEWQ,4,"Lately i'm preferring BK instead MC cause taste seems more Juicy and looks made at wood fire.
I have ordered an BK with egg and finger cheese"
ChIJo1vdm-onQg0RuPD8i5LaEWQ,1,"The worst Burger King.
Staff do not speak English. When I was selecting the order, I was using English language.
The staff member didn‚Äôt change the status for my order, so when he was screaming in Spanish I was not reacting as it was not my number.
I realised that something wrong when they removed my order from the TV screen.

When I approached the staff member, he didn‚Äôt speak English, didn‚Äôt apologise and he handed to me cold burger.

The restaurant itself is dirty as they don‚Äôt have time to clean it.

The image of Burger King is destroyed for me:(("
ChIJo1vdm-onQg0RuPD8i5LaEWQ,1,"Slow af and unorganized. Empty restaurant but I had to wait 25 minutes for two small burgers. Customers that arrived after me, were served faster. Won't come here again."
ChIJo1vdm-onQg0RuPD8i5LaEWQ,4,"I'd give it 4.5 stars. First Burger King I go to in Spain, and mainly cause I was curious if the flavors would be the same. The whopper tasted exactly like the US whopper. There are more selections here though. You can either get the regular fries or patatas supremas, which are potato wedges. Much better flavor. Oh and they also serve beer here!"
ChIJbYvKyL0nQg0R981bqgVos40,5,Such a nice friendly place! Maybe you need to speak a little Spanish but perfectly communicable (please use dictionary if needed) the entrecot(beef) was amazing and i loved the Jamon Iberico!

ChIJ-wuy070nQg0Rq92rDo67JrM,5,"Very attentive staff, I ate a 12 euro menu that came with lentils and rice as a main course, cooked chicharon, sweet potato and salad.
Highlight the spicy sauce that stings.
Advisable."
ChIJ-wuy070nQg0Rq92rDo67JrM,4,"Dishes consistent with quality and price, friendly service, the place is not so spacious."
ChIJ-wuy070nQg0Rq92rDo67JrM,2,"Of about 10 times I have gone, 7 I have felt poorly served, the food was super bland, the fritters were too big (a lot of dough in the center that becomes annoying)
The pandebono is delicious, the sobrebarriga with onions is delicious, but the poor service and the delay whether to eat there or at home is terrible."
ChIJK5b2LsAnQg0RBnjevtVSu8o,5,"Excellent and flavorful grilled chicken with baked potatoes. Operates like a fast food concept with fast food pricing, though with excellent food befitting what you will find in a restaurant. Friendly team as well. Highly recommended."
ChIJK5b2LsAnQg0RBnjevtVSu8o,5,"Wow, a wonderful charcoal chicken, I'm new to this area and when I moved I went out to buy some things and I was attracted to this place, starting with the guy being very friendly in his attention but the chicken was 10/10, the crispy and delicious potatoes were well made al dente and the sauces were amazing. The one that attracted us even more was the green one, I think it's similar to the Venezuelan guasacaca but it was spicy to die for but super delicious, my family was delighted. We will return. I recommend it. The only thing left to do is try their rice. bye."
ChIJK5b2LsAnQg0RBnjevtVSu8o,5,"The best chicken I have eaten since I came to Spain in 2019, the pod is good and quite filling.
Great, I made love to the chicken every time I bit into it because it was tasty"
ChIJK5b2LsAnQg0RBnjevtVSu8o,4,"The best grilled chicken without a doubt!! It is not of bad quality, and quite an acceptable size for the price. We took the full menu, whole chicken + potatoes + chaufa rice + drink + 3 sauces.
The natural potatoes, of large caliber, are by far the worst on the menu, with all due respect, the rice is very very weak. The drink is very good, they give you a choice between several 75 liter snacks. The menu costs ‚Ç¨23 approx, they charge you ‚Ç¨0.40 for each place setting...normal sauces. The service from the shop assistants is good, the dispensing of the food is fast. Clean unisex bathrooms."
ChIJK5b2LsAnQg0RBnjevtVSu8o,5,Very good chicken!! One of the best I've ever eaten. Super tasty and the breast was not dry at all! Highly recommended.
ChIJp2fKgcAnQg0RpK74fsFjsO0,3,"Not great, not terrible. Low prices. Desert was nice. The atmosphere was disappointing"
ChIJp2fKgcAnQg0RpK74fsFjsO0,5,Nice and delicious
ChIJp2fKgcAnQg0RpK74fsFjsO0,4,"Good attention. It is the first time that I have been in an Ecuadorian restaurant that serves you food quickly.
The bad thing is that it doesn't have a children's menu. Bone nagges or chicken strips.
They only have it Ecuadorian style potatoes with chicken or sausages.
I mean I say it as a suggestion
For the rest I recommend it 100x100"
ChIJp2fKgcAnQg0RpK74fsFjsO0,5,"Very delicious, fresh food, quiet and pleasant place, friendly service, homemade food."
ChIJp2fKgcAnQg0RpK74fsFjsO0,5,"Excellent menu of the day, priced at ‚Ç¨11. First time I tried the green banana empanada, it was delicious filled with meat and a very good size. The barbecue rib, soft and well served. Excellent attention from the waiter, the menu includes dessert and drink."
ChIJE0Q8XpcnQg0RY-0J-CFqbGA,3,Not bad if there is any other option.
ChIJE0Q8XpcnQg0RY-0J-CFqbGA,1,They made all the orders except ours. And on top of that they didn't let us drink from our liters on the terrace. We spent a long time waiting while we watched other people who had arrived later receive their dishes. Regrettable service. Kebab and Durum very good.
ChIJE0Q8XpcnQg0RY-0J-CFqbGA,2,"They gave me old potatoes from the day before I suppose, mixed with new potatoes. They didn't have fried chicken yet and I ate durum, there was no paper in the service. Not recommended"
ChIJE0Q8XpcnQg0RY-0J-CFqbGA,5,"The food is very delicious. Very good deal
I will repeat"
ChIJE0Q8XpcnQg0RY-0J-CFqbGA,1,"I didn't like it at all, the food had little meat and was very dry, you could tell it was made the day before, and very little meat, most of it was lettuce, onion and sauce, and the chicken was burnt. To make matters worse, the delivery man wanted to trick me. When I placed the order I said two doner kebabs, two potatoes and a roast chicken, the person who wrote it down repeated it to me and repeated it well and told me the price because when he gets to my house he tells me oh, I had forgotten to write down a doner kebab, you have to pay me more. He didn't forget to write it down because he repeated it well to me on the phone and if not, he wouldn't have shown up at my house with two doner kebabs, he would have appeared with just one. That's what happens to me because I haven't read the reviews on this site because most people speak badly about it. I don't recommend it to you. On top of that, the food wasn't even delicious. I forgot to say that the potatoes were horrible."
ChIJFeJrM8AnQg0R-TJzlm6K-7M,5,Really terrific place with nice food in good price. 10/10! üñ§üî•
ChIJFeJrM8AnQg0R-TJzlm6K-7M,5,Food is good for the prices. Drinks are also quite cheap and the servers were very kind. Good experience
ChIJFeJrM8AnQg0R-TJzlm6K-7M,4,Everything is praiseworthy.But it closes by 11pm but it would be better if it will open till 12am
ChIJFeJrM8AnQg0R-TJzlm6K-7M,4,"If you want nice food and cheap, but an great place to drink beer this is for you. Just near city center."
ChIJFeJrM8AnQg0R-TJzlm6K-7M,5,1‚Ç¨ for each unit.  Small quantity but very tasty.  Enables you to try many other options. Combos available too.  5/5 for ambience. Must visit for inexpensive but filling snacks

ChIJI6itLpEnQg0ROcgVTxI1MRo,1,"Well, I'm from Alicante and it turns out and it stands out that my friend ordered a Cuban-style rice which was hard, they changed it for some white beans that were also hard, then they added a chicken fillet, stiff like the saint himself. Pedro and the potato garnish tasted like raw potatoes. Look, I won't say more, I'm not really going to go and I'm very unhappy for my friend and her bad experience."
ChIJI6itLpEnQg0ROcgVTxI1MRo,5,It is my reference restaurant. Good food and better service. A family restaurant with heart. There are few restaurants like this.
ChIJI6itLpEnQg0ROcgVTxI1MRo,5,"Menu 12e, it's fine, the coffee with milk is 1.80e, the coffee is small for a bit
A detail that they put some olives on top"
ChIJI6itLpEnQg0ROcgVTxI1MRo,3,Normal and pleasant place to eat from time to time. Dishes not very abundant but correct.
ChIJfxtuHsQnQg0Rigjd-1wmzKA,1,"This pizza franchise and it's complicated menu might be well known in Spain, but not where I come from. I asked the woman at the counter for a pizza for one person and she started asking a million questions about how I would like to combine it with drinks and side orders. With my basic Spanish skills it started getting too difficult to understand and she became visibly agitated because I didn't know how their system worked. So, I asked her for a menu and her immediate response was to point her finger at a QR code on the  counter and said ""scan it"". Do these teenagers know what data roaming charges are and how much it costs? They must think that everyone comes from the European Union. Why can't these businesses just provide a simple menu printed on paper? Pathetic!!! I just walked out without ordering anything. I can't stand teenagers with an attitude that make you feel like they are doing you a favour. If you don't like working with the public, go and work on a farm."
ChIJfxtuHsQnQg0Rigjd-1wmzKA,4,This place was empty at my arrival. I enjoyed it because the service was well. Although I  did waited for the food for 15 minutes it was good. I liked it. The lady who was serving me was very nice and help a lot. I was having trouble with my debit card but she had enough patient to help me through this. I really enjoyed it and recommend it.
ChIJfxtuHsQnQg0Rigjd-1wmzKA,5,The  pizza very delicious üçïüçï

ChIJM4umh5AnQg0RMfHVSeufp8I,5,Tasty pizza for good price
ChIJM4umh5AnQg0RMfHVSeufp8I,5,"The pizzas are very delicious, and they are homemade.
We ordered the 4 cheeses and the special and they were both very good.
The thin and crispy dough, if you are in the neighborhood and you want a homemade pizza, this place will not disappoint you."
ChIJM4umh5AnQg0RMfHVSeufp8I,5,"Since we moved to this neighborhood we chose this pizzeria because of the proximity and it was a great success, all the pizzas are spectacular, my favorite was the ""Di Mario"" for 15 euros they gave us a family one that 4 adults ate and we were full, the speed too a point in favor, it is important to highlight the honesty of the team, I forgot my backpack and the next day they delivered it to me, thank you very much Canaletto... I will continue ordering pizzas with you."
ChIJM4umh5AnQg0RMfHVSeufp8I,5,"I always order takeout since it is close to home, the pizza is good, very good, the delivery service is super fast and I have never had any problems with my order"

ChIJkxQaZ5cnQg0RN5Vr4D8gOhQ,4,Food is delicious! Cool Atmosphere! Sitting comfortable! Service is excellent!
ChIJkxQaZ5cnQg0RN5Vr4D8gOhQ,1,the worst place I was in Madrid!  Don't go to this restaurant!
ChIJkxQaZ5cnQg0RN5Vr4D8gOhQ,5,Top
ChIJkxQaZ5cnQg0RN5Vr4D8gOhQ,2,"Some friends and I decided to eat at El Faro guided by the number of people there were on the terrace. We opted for the menu of the day (‚Ç¨16) although the options were very basic. If it was good, it would be a good place to come back and try fish and seafood.
First we ordered salad, ratatouille and green beans with ham. The salad had a stale ingredient; It was acidic. The ratatouille was vegetables with fried tomato, everything from a can, half a hard-boiled egg and some tuna crumbs; disgusting. The green beans were from a jar, and of all this, the only thing that was saved. Second: mini cachopos. The fries were cold and it was definitely frozen. It was a sheet of meat to be dipped in bechamel with some cheese flavor, coated, of course.
The waiter was friendly at all times. He removed the salad when we commented on the acidity, and brought us another one of beans.
For a moment I thought they had given us trouble when they saw us being guiris. Then, we saw that the salad was also left on the next table, and that they moved it with fish to another table that smelled like a garbage can with fish remains. At one point, they returned it. I thought because that was bad. Curiously, the foul smell returned with the fish being more cooked. You could tell they were regular customers, which surprised me even more. Everyone chooses.
In my case, I will not become part of their regular clientele.
I give two stars because the service was good and the waiter was attentive at all times. Zero, for the food."
ChIJkxQaZ5cnQg0RN5Vr4D8gOhQ,5,"We went on the weekend, and ordered a menu.
The truth is that at first glance the price may seem a bit expensive, but when the dishes arrived we were surprised. The quality and quantity is very good.
The cod stuffed peppers were brutal. And one of my companions had an entrec√¥te that hardly even fit on the plate.
We were on the terrace, very comfortable and the food was very good. In addition to the attention, especially from one of the waiters.
We will repeat."
ChIJradfVAInQg0RTCTox1Nx7Dw,1,"Terrible service, and lack of hygiene in the place. They also dedicate themselves to wallpapering the neighborhood with their advertising, leaving all the cars like this!"
ChIJradfVAInQg0RTCTox1Nx7Dw,1,"Why do you put on the Just-Eat page, ""About Us"" section that we can enjoy the best Peruvian cuisine and offer Peruvian delicacies when the restaurant is 100% Bolivian?
Please correct it."
ChIJradfVAInQg0RTCTox1Nx7Dw,1,"TERRIBLE ATTENTION
SLOW
WITHOUT EVEN HAVING RECEIVED US WITH A GOOD DAY
MUSIC OF TWO TYPES AT THE SAME TIME WITH HIGH VOLUME
WITHOUT HYDROALCOHOLIC GEL OR TEMPERATURE TAKING
FOOD EXAGGERATED IN QUANTITY, WITHOUT TAKING THE TROUBLE TO WARN IT
THE COFFEES TOOK FOREVER
WITHOUT GIVING US A SEE YOU LATER OR A THANK YOU WHEN WE LEAVE
BADLY EDUCATED
TO NEVER RETURN"
ChIJradfVAInQg0RTCTox1Nx7Dw,1,"Because you have to place a star to be able to enter the menu, but it doesn't even deserve a -0. Not even being the last restaurant to eat in would I go. And they also cheat on drinks. This here is terrible."

ChIJ5yf1sdMnQg0RvC9hR_tOcLI,2,"We arrived and were recommended not to order a certain dish as it would take 40 mins. So we ordered other dishes including ceviche, aeropuerto, tallarines saltados but still took over an hour for the kitchen to prepare and serve. Other people who entered and ordered after were served before us.  Food was tasty but kitchen too slow. Bathroom was also very dirty."

ChIJ5yf1sdMnQg0RvC9hR_tOcLI,5,"I went with my boyfriend for dinner and we were delighted with the staff and the food.
We ordered airport, stuffed potato and we loved the cause A1 very much.
The fabulous passion fruit pisco and chicha morada reminded us of Peru.
We will be back soon!"
ChIJ5yf1sdMnQg0RvC9hR_tOcLI,5,"I would repeat a thousand times
I have gone several times because it is very well connected, just one minute from the Oporto metro, and the treatment of the waiters, the service and the exquisite food‚Ä¶
Very rich and tasty food, and very rich, delicious and economical breakfasts.
A very spacious and beautiful place is very worth it.
I will repeat without a doubt
Thanks to Sara and her team for offering this service."
ChIJ3bAQQJEnQg0R6lC8q6JtwpU,5,"It's been a long time since I've had an experience like this. They have a super original food (apparently it's from T√ºrkiye) called quebab. They put it on a stick and roast it and cut it with the hair clipper. It is very tasty and they also have a lot of sauces and accessories. It's very exotic and exciting, it's like being in an African country or something! Unforgettable. Also came a drug addict who looked like Angelina Jolie. Super recommended."
ChIJ3bAQQJEnQg0R6lC8q6JtwpU,5,"I love the place, the quality food and fast service, the bad thing is that there is not much space"
ChIJ3bAQQJEnQg0R6lC8q6JtwpU,1,"Terrible, I thought that based on the comments this place was good, I went to eat some pieces of fried chicken, and I ordered 3, one of them had rotten meat, it smelled foul, I told them and the least I expected was that: or not they would charge or replace my dam with another, but it seemed normal to the guy who serves it when I told him... very bad, only and last time I go to that place, I don't recommend it ü§Æ"
ChIJ3bAQQJEnQg0R6lC8q6JtwpU,1,"Terrible kebab, one of the worst kebabs I have ever tried.
Bad attention from the owner, he doesn't ask what type of meat I want, because I don't even ask, and he is going to charge me, I tell him this is mine, I say yes, you haven't even asked me what type of meat and he tells me that it is my obligation to tell him what type of meat.
Bad attention and for a plate of 4 potatoes and a little kebab 7.50 euros, for that money there are very good kebabs, not recommended, if you are in the area, you have other options"
ChIJ3bAQQJEnQg0R6lC8q6JtwpU,5,"Good place to eat, the owner is very friendly. Very delicious food, quality - price.

Portions are generous and service is excellent. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a wonderful pizza and dinner experience!"
ChIJbeluZJknQg0RHrzXmfw2KA4,5,"During our vacation in Madrid with my family we came across O'pizza and the taste of pesto, salami, vegetarian pizzas and the San Sebasti√°n dessert remained engraved on our palate. We were very impressed by your warm welcome and hospitality."
ChIJbeluZJknQg0RHrzXmfw2KA4,5,"Mustafa is a very kind and smiling person. In addition to preparing some delicious pizzas. The place is new, very clean and very warmly decorated. A 10 ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you"
ChIJBy5ri2EnQg0RxgcLM7680Iw,5,"We have ordered a menu to share, we ordered ceviche and fish chicharr√≥n accompanied by chicha morada. The dish is abundant, the flavor is very good, the space of the place is spacious, bright, fresh and on the edge of General Ricardos towards the Porto metro. I had to order another chicha morada because it was good, the first time I had tried it."
ChIJBy5ri2EnQg0RxgcLM7680Iw,5,"My boy and I were looking for a Peruvian restaurant in the neighborhood.
And he found this place which left us surprised and delighted. The food was delicious, as well as very well presented (congratulations to the chef), the waiters, both he and she were very pleasant and very attentive.
It was an experience that exceeded our expectations, without a doubt, we have a new favorite place to return to."
ChIJBy5ri2EnQg0RxgcLM7680Iw,5,"Nice Peruvian restaurant in Carabanchel. The ambience is very open and friendly thanks to the very large windows.
The dishes are very tasty and correctly prepared.
I can especially recommend ceviche and leche de tigre.
The staff is friendly and quick.
I will definitely come again.
There is also an outdoor area, especially on warm days or in summer.
Really recommended if you want to try Peruvian cuisine."
ChIJBy5ri2EnQg0RxgcLM7680Iw,5,"My girlfriend and I were looking for a Peruvian restaurant that was delicious, and this is the perfect place by far. It was worth it, and that's why we came out delighted, beyond what we imagined. Furthermore, taking into account that we are Peruvians, our demands for flavor are maximum, and here they were more than met.

We ordered Frozen Lemonade, Lomo Saltado, and Chicken Chaufa. Each of the dishes is tasty, with good quantities, and excellent plating. The chefs are Peruvian, and therefore the great impeccable result that amazed us so that every time we pass through Madrid we do not hesitate to repeat.

The place is modern and cozy. Their waiters are very friendly, with very respectful and friendly customer service.

Don't hesitate, a great place that you won't forget!"
ChIJBy5ri2EnQg0RxgcLM7680Iw,3,"Good food and very attentive service.
It is a neighborhood bar, it is not a restaurant, but the important thing is the food, everything is very good.
One downside is that it was a little cold inside the premises."
ChIJPUsJ03InQg0RDQxKWjW67dY,2,"I ordered a Peruvian-style chicharr√≥n sandwich, hoping to enjoy its characteristic balance between the crunch of the chicharr√≥n, the freshness of the onion, and the creamy touch of a good sauce. However, the presentation left a lot to be desired. The sandwich arrived without any sauce, which made it dry and difficult to enjoy, especially accompanied by an Americano.

The onion, although abundant, did not provide enough juiciness to balance the texture of the bread and meat. As for the price, ‚Ç¨7.50 is high considering the quality and the lack of an accompaniment that enhances the flavors.

This sandwich has the potential to be an excellent option if the proposal is improved with an appropriate sauce and better harmonization of the ingredients. I hope the establishment takes these details into account to elevate the dining experience and do justice to such a beloved classic of Peruvian cuisine."
ChIJPUsJ03InQg0RDQxKWjW67dY,4,"It is mainly a Latin cafeteria and since it is my first time going I have had a good experience.
- The place has many tables
- The waiters are very attentive and the food comes out very quickly
- Warmth and price
- Has a terrace

Otherwise everything is fine

All the best
Gassss ‚úåÔ∏è"
ChIJPUsJ03InQg0RDQxKWjW67dY,5,"It's my trusted coffee shop in the neighborhood. Today I went to study a little and it was recommended to get rid of everything.
I ordered a cup of quinoa which was delicious. Also a potato omelette sandwich which I had to take half because it was huge.
The staff is very nice. It's one of my favorite places üíö."
ChIJPUsJ03InQg0RDQxKWjW67dY,5,"We had a snack at the Cafe de Oporto, and it has a fairly large terrace, so when the weather is good, you have to be in heaven having breakfast or having a snack.
Inside there are quite a few tables, and there are even some high stools at the bar, to have a quick drink, the atmosphere is very pleasant.
It has an extensive menu, both sweet and savory, and everything looks very good. I took a look at the French toast they had at the entrance, which looked exquisite.
We decided to have some pancakes, with cream and syrup, a Viennese coffee, and a mint-poleo infusion, and everything was very delicious, in addition to a very friendly service, and the waitresses were quite fast.
Totally recommendable!!!
We will return!!!
I attach photos of what we took!!!"
ChIJPUsJ03InQg0RDQxKWjW67dY,5,"Everything is great, especially the service and the coffee. What delicious artisan buns."
ChIJndJMtJMnQg0RLdiGp0bW4B8,5,"They have a meal that I have eaten in few kebabs, quality price 10.
The guys are very attentive and always have a smile when they serve you.
I usually bring takeout when I come home from work.
Totally recommended."
ChIJndJMtJMnQg0RLdiGp0bW4B8,1,"The service is terrible, they also deceive people, I ordered something to eat and it had nothing to do with what the menu said, plus the service is terrible, it is close to where I live, however I will never go to that place again, very bad, zero recommendation."
ChIJndJMtJMnQg0RLdiGp0bW4B8,5,"The best Kebab in Madrid.
It's always full of people...there must be a reason!!
Great variety of food
donner, kebbab, pizzas, chicken...etc"
ChIJndJMtJMnQg0RLdiGp0bW4B8,1,"Police station in poor condition, they smoke in front of you and there are pigeons all the time. I don't recommend it."
ChIJndJMtJMnQg0RLdiGp0bW4B8,1,Bad meat
ChIJJ5h6rZMnQg0Rwlyc5MRsQO0,4,"Great place at a very good location. The menu was very elaborate and almost everything was available. We had the grilled platter and it was super delicious.
The humus was good too. The croquettes could have been better but overall we were very happy with the food..
Will visit again."
ChIJJ5h6rZMnQg0Rwlyc5MRsQO0,4,"The food was amazing and the place was not at all expensive given the prime location that it is located in (right beside Plaza de Espana)

The ambience is amazing and all the more nice to sit outside on a warm sunny day.
The croquettes did not have a lot of pollo and the fries were a bit cold but every thing else was amazing. Totally recommend the Plato de la casa."
ChIJJ5h6rZMnQg0Rwlyc5MRsQO0,5,Chicken was a bit dry for my taste but everything else was very good.
ChIJJ5h6rZMnQg0Rwlyc5MRsQO0,4,I liked the place and the food very much. Amazing kababs and they have mahou beer on tap.
ChIJJ5h6rZMnQg0Rwlyc5MRsQO0,4,"Great pizza and crust!
Easy to sit and order."
ChIJAYFWVZInQg0RjuNq3feenCI,5,"Very nice local pub. Best price/performance ratio we've got. Very rich burger for only 5,20. For tourists ideal place to meet a local bar."
ChIJAYFWVZInQg0RjuNq3feenCI,1,Fatal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
ChIJAYFWVZInQg0RjuNq3feenCI,5,Excellent service
ChIJAYFWVZInQg0RjuNq3feenCI,5,Ok
ChIJAYFWVZInQg0RjuNq3feenCI,5,good
ChIJG7M_1jAnQg0RvNdt43olQ4U,5,"We have opened new tastes for us in this place . The authentic cuisine , cooked perfectly and served aesthetically. Nice and welcoming staff , even without knowing Spanish we‚Äôve been able to communicate with them."
ChIJG7M_1jAnQg0RvNdt43olQ4U,3,Not cheap and they charged higher prices than those indicated on the menu. This additional charge is not properly advertised. The food was ok and they had some Mariachis playing inside which added a nice touch.
ChIJG7M_1jAnQg0RvNdt43olQ4U,5,It‚Äôs a nice venue to sit at the terrace and have some beer and tapas with your friends. We were served by Roc√≠o and she was very attentive to all of our orders
ChIJG7M_1jAnQg0RvNdt43olQ4U,4,"Probably best Ecuadorian restaurant I tried in Madrid, better than the more upscale and expensive ones in downtown Madrid. Service  could improve."
ChIJG7M_1jAnQg0RvNdt43olQ4U,5,Sara and Rocio our waitress was great. I highly recommend this place.
ChIJ_f_diNMnQg0RsopDkPOMX3Q,3,Regular
ChIJ_f_diNMnQg0RsopDkPOMX3Q,5,"The food and price are excellent!
The kitchen closes at 12PM at night and serves until 2AM.
I recommend the site 100%"
ChIJ_f_diNMnQg0RsopDkPOMX3Q,1,We ordered 4 glasses of red. And it was colored water. It didn't taste like anything. And for what they charged us. ‚Ç¨20 Not even in the center of Madrid.
ChIJ_f_diNMnQg0RsopDkPOMX3Q,1,"It's a good place with a good atmosphere. But on the part of the waitress Laura, because they were lesbians, she didn't serve us in a bad way and with bad manners, we asked her to play cumbia and she said that we couldn't hear that and that she was paid for being waitress not for playing music very apart from that
I turned the tables on my friend, then she continued to serve us in a bad way. If she doesn't like her job, she should look for another one because one is going to indulge herself, not have misunderstandings in a place where you have 3 hours of consuming and they don't attend to it. That way it's disrespectful"
ChIJ_f_diNMnQg0RsopDkPOMX3Q,1,"Bad service. I asked the waitress for music and she replied that she was going to see if the colleague would play it. What a lack of respect knowing that we are consuming and they are not giving us anything. Bad service. No. I recommend them and it was my first time visiting the bar. It's sad if the waiters don't like the work, let them dedicate themselves to something else. Customer service is very important, Mr. Owner, pay attention to that because you are going to fail. üëçüëç"
ChIJrSiRS5InQg0RoJn1dK-UQ-o,1,"I always go to eat there, they always have some problem
- At 9pm the kitchen is closed
- Or that they can't make smoothies
- I ordered a ceviche and that looked like water with green pepper with four shrimp
- Once they gave me bad-smelling chili
- The tables on the terrace are usually dirty and the cloth leaves the table with an unpleasant smell.

And yesterday I went and I think it will be the last time because I went around 4pm with my friend and they were able to clean the chairs and they made such noise that I couldn't even talk to my friend who was in front of them, they moved the chairs and the noise was unbearable, they made jokes between them but in loud voices and the truth is we half ate and left THEY DIDN'T EVEN GOODBYE WHEN WE SAID GOODBYE

Everything is very bad..."
ChIJrSiRS5InQg0RoJn1dK-UQ-o,1,"A Latin place, they sell Latin food, smoothies...the place inside is quite dirty. The gel dispenser is unfortunate. I ordered a white one and my friend a coffee with milk: it took 10 minutes to serve us, instead of coffee with milk she served us a glass of milk. The clear one, the worst I've ever had. Then we ordered two empanadas, and it took 20 minutes. He charged us 9 for everything. I'm never coming back. A lousy place"
ChIJrSiRS5InQg0RoJn1dK-UQ-o,4,Local frequented by Latin people known for its buckets of beer and also good Latin cuisine
ChIJrSiRS5InQg0RoJn1dK-UQ-o,3,"The food is not up to par. The place smells too much like fryer oil, especially in summer. Beer and stuff are reasonably priced. Recommended to drink something else, not to eat.

There was a table upstairs and everything was empty downstairs but they told us we couldn't go downstairs.
Incomprehensible.
Except for not wanting to get dirty.
In order not to get dirty, you don't have to receive clients, you'll see how it stays clean."
ChIJrSiRS5InQg0RoJn1dK-UQ-o,1,"On the terrace, a red wine for ‚Ç¨5 with more ice than red...and a beer for ‚Ç¨3. Seeing that they didn't even offer me the menu, I asked about the appetizer. When I returned, the very unpleasant waitress yelled at me to choose sausage or wings, but quickly because the tray is heavy for her.... Terrible service for the prices and beware the sausage I had to leave because the potatoes were cold and stiff... DON'T GO!!!"
ChIJl4_B9JMnQg0R7cDgJGxuU0Q,5,"Magnificent restaurant!! We ordered mote with chicharr√≥n, encebollado and two combined dishes. Everything was delicious and the service was spectacular, all the dishes came out on time, hot and quite generous. We loved it."
ChIJl4_B9JMnQg0R7cDgJGxuU0Q,5,We loved it. Very good Chaulafan and very good treatment. We will return!!!
ChIJl4_B9JMnQg0R7cDgJGxuU0Q,5,"My first time eating in an Ecuadorian restaurant, the waiter helped me choose what to order and he was right.
The incredible mixed bolon for just ‚Ç¨7 and two come.
The fried potato with roasted potato is incredible and has a spectacular flavor.
And the tamale for only ‚Ç¨4 and it was soooo good.
I will return, and if you like spicy, the sauce for the bolon is 100% recommended."
ChIJl4_B9JMnQg0R7cDgJGxuU0Q,5,A homely place where I eat in most places so the food never ceases to surprise. A good quantity with very good quality and above all excellent service. We are sure we will return.
ChIJl4_B9JMnQg0R7cDgJGxuU0Q,4,"Let's see, it is an Ecuadorian restaurant as its name says, there are many √† la carte dishes from the mountains, coast and east of Ecuador,
They also have a menu, very good and delicious soups, that I remember my grandparents on my mother's side who cooked it in Ecuador when I go to visit them, it is the first time in 15 years that I eat a ceviche, and an encebollado just like the ones they they do in Quito.
My Spanish friends love the delicious prawn ceviche üëè and they don't have any objections like some, we have been frequenting this place for more than 1 year, I simply recommend that you visit this place in Madrid Calle Valle del Oro Carabanchel, the encebollados and ceviches of Tremendous delicious prawns mmm üòãüòãüòúüëçüòÇüòÇ"
ChIJu9HiDDAnQg0RefSpVEAkOxs,1,"It's a shame that in order to rate this place I have to give at least one star for the terrible service they give to the customer who comes to this small and narrow place. They are not at all attentive to each of the people who come in to order and the person in charge of the orders, in addition to not even answering the greeting, warns that any order will take at least an hour. If it is a place that is too small and does not have the capacity to receive more customers, they should change location."
ChIJu9HiDDAnQg0RefSpVEAkOxs,5,"The food is very good, I ordered the pizza, the oven roasted pig leg bocatas, and took home one  pig leg  (must be requested in advance). 10/10. Will be back for sure (and for the pig leg)"
ChIJu9HiDDAnQg0RefSpVEAkOxs,4,Good ratio between price/quality
ChIJu9HiDDAnQg0RefSpVEAkOxs,5,"There is a long wait but they tell you, I went for three Cuban breads and as there are quite a few orders beforehand they let you know that it would be about 40 minutes and it was just the time they told me.

It is super delicious, the bread is super soft, very well filled and the most delicious is the crispy pork.

If you are patient and walk around to make the wait more enjoyable, great.

I would return and recommend it without a doubt."
ChIJu9HiDDAnQg0RefSpVEAkOxs,4,"There are times and days when you have to wait up to 1 hour for your takeout order, and people do it, which shows the quality/price ratio of their products.
I wish they had a larger location that would allow them to have more staff and comfort to do their work more efficiently and therefore faster, but for now we will have to adapt because it is worth the inconvenience and the wait."
ChIJwYz3CpQnQg0R4KIbaSUqbVY,5,"The fried chicken was one of the very best one had. Really crunchy and well seasoned,  plus the sauce it came with was really nice,  and complimented it well. The Mexican (veal) burger I had was quite tasty too, I did enjoy it and the portion was very reasonable.
Nicely presented, tasty, good portion size üëçüèª
The price is quite OK too I feel.
The location is easily accessible, not to far from stations. Is very open with large windows overlooking the street and the interior was quite nice + was comfortable.
The servers were thoughtful and asked if we enjoyed the meal.
Would love to return surely, to try other items of the menu. I'm positively sure they are good.
Recommended ‚úÖ"
ChIJwYz3CpQnQg0R4KIbaSUqbVY,5,The burgers were great but the best thing were the placemats. I know I'm supposed to be a grown man but I can't resist colouring in
ChIJwYz3CpQnQg0R4KIbaSUqbVY,5,Yum! Delicious hamburgers!
ChIJwYz3CpQnQg0R4KIbaSUqbVY,5,"The best hamburger in Madrid!! Besides sophisticated, it has a very familiar and pleasant atmosphere. Congrats Neto!!"
ChIJwYz3CpQnQg0R4KIbaSUqbVY,5,"The meals are huge, tasty and the pricing is pretty decent, specially when compared to similar restaurants."
ChIJcVbb3TEnQg0RnIMTQxX_IlY,5,"The food was made with care and delicious. The fish was fresh, well cut and presented nicely. The staff was very nice and friendly. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was clean. Would recommend and will be back!"
ChIJcVbb3TEnQg0RnIMTQxX_IlY,4,"Nice place to go, lots of choice and everything is pretty good.
The room is too cold and it's not deserving of a long lunch.
They also don't include any drink in the price and don't serve free water."
ChIJcVbb3TEnQg0RnIMTQxX_IlY,1,server was super rude and showed so much attitude. its mandatory to order at least one drink to eat so the lady kept rushing us to order. super disturbing n unkind. don‚Äôt recommend this place at all
ChIJcVbb3TEnQg0RnIMTQxX_IlY,1,"Uno de los peores buffets a los que he ido. La calidad de la comida es muy mala y en el buffet de mediodia por lo visto no entran cosas que est√°n anunciadas en su cartes de fuera como el paro o el pulpo, cosa de. La que deber√≠an avisar. Hay muy poca variedad para el medio dia. La tempura solo ten√≠a pimientos, y en trozos grand√≠simos que estaban muy poco hechos; el at√∫n ol√≠a y sab√≠a fatal y cuando se lo he dicho a la camarera me ha dicho que estaba bien. Sabemos que estos sitios no tienen una calidad de 10 por el precio, pero hay muchas opciones mejores."
ChIJcVbb3TEnQg0RnIMTQxX_IlY,5,Very good value for money for the buffet. Abundant quantities and very good sushi. Highly recommended. And very kind. The sushi is brought to you by a robot.
ChIJ-d-SEPMnQg0RE2888dvgwY8,1,"I went with my family to try it but I was surprised there weren't many people on the terrace. The waitress (the girl looked Dominican) didn't even know who was coming first or anything. We ordered three drinks and they also brought us some naguett tapas (it's More to say, they were refried, they looked like chewing gum) the fries were good, but you can't imagine when you get to the bottom (see the image) for hygiene and health reasons, it seems disastrous to me, why if someone is allergic or intolerant? (it would be a danger) then the Peruvian girl arrived, she was friendly and we thank her for the greeting."
ChIJ-d-SEPMnQg0RE2888dvgwY8,2,"We were on the terrace well cared for.
The value for money is normal, but the appetizers leave a lot to be desired. If you are going to have paella as an appetizer, you have to do everything possible so that at least it can be eaten.
I wouldn't mend it at all."
ChIJ-d-SEPMnQg0RE2888dvgwY8,3,"Good bar to have a quick drink.
With the drink they put a tapa, which is a plus, but the tapa can be greatly improved.
Very good attention."
ChIJ-d-SEPMnQg0RE2888dvgwY8,1,"I give 0 stars because it doesn't give me any more options, the waitress and owner is a racist who didn't want to sell me any bottles because she said she didn't have any drinks when she had customers inside and outside the bar, I'm going to publicly denounce.... very bad on the part of the owner and waitress... what a shame for the lack of taste on the part of that waitress and even more so having a minor serving... what a disastrous attitude....!!!"
ChIJ-d-SEPMnQg0RE2888dvgwY8,2,"We have had a summer red wine with lemon. A very bad wine, fighty, with such a strong flavor that I didn't even drink half a glass. They didn't even put a sad olive as an appetizer. Then a grilled ear with a sauce. The bad sauce didn't add anything, almost no flavor. The ear was cooked and then as if heated on a grill, hard and rubbery, fatal. To not return. There are many better bars in the neighborhood for tapas."
ChIJ4V1Fud4nQg0R9XTBEAOd6YE,5,Really good food! The Bolon de queso is soooooo good! So were the tacos and quesadillas. The waitresses offered WONDERFUL and QUICK service. The quality to price ratio is Excellent! Great work!
ChIJ4V1Fud4nQg0R9XTBEAOd6YE,5,"Quality, inexpensive food. Friendly staff. Me and my friends have come here so many times for their flautas, tacos, and quesadillas while we lived in Oporto."

ChIJe7L9O5InQg0R4DmCMZiybOY,5,Ok
ChIJe7L9O5InQg0R4DmCMZiybOY,5,10 points!
ChIJe7L9O5InQg0R4DmCMZiybOY,5,We came to Madrid looking for typical food and we couldn't find a better tavern: delicious food and spectacular service from the staff.
ChIJe7L9O5InQg0R4DmCMZiybOY,5,"I have known this place all my life and for me it is a reference site in the neighborhood. The staff is professional, very friendly and attentive. The food is very delicious. Vegan and vegetarian options"
ChIJJZYA3pMnQg0Rzunt_-2t7_M,5,"Rich, rich and oversized. Fast service, takeaway or home delivery."
ChIJJZYA3pMnQg0Rzunt_-2t7_M,4,"The food has good seasoning, the place is small so I recommend ordering to go. If you eat there you will pay one euro per cover. They served me very quickly, I recommend the steak and salted noodles."
ChIJJZYA3pMnQg0Rzunt_-2t7_M,1,I thought the fatal chicken was good like General Ricardos' other chicken. super raw.  a little more and they give it to me so I can do it. house 25 euros with. everything is bad too
ChIJJZYA3pMnQg0Rzunt_-2t7_M,1,"At first they gave us cold chicken without juice, we asked for juice at least... they took it away and made us wait for more than half an hour
I don't know how difficult it is to add juice to the chicken.
Terrible attention. The rude employee
And apart from that they eat in front of the customer."
ChIJJZYA3pMnQg0Rzunt_-2t7_M,5,"Very tasty takeaway charcoal chicken. And the portions are abundant, rather for takeout, the place is very small."
ChIJAQbP-0YnQg0RW5gFgJmstvw,4,Can you contact me on e-mail so that I can help you bring customers to your restaurant
ChIJAQbP-0YnQg0RW5gFgJmstvw,1,"This does not exist here, there is another one later"
ChIJAQbP-0YnQg0RW5gFgJmstvw,5,
ChIJOeKqXd4nQg0RgpMMrWWTXnA,5,The best grilled chicken and biriani in Madrid!! We had it for lunch. The restaurant is opened late so we are considering to come back later on the same day.

ChIJJ2d_mrsnQg0RuN8PrxwHQPU,1,Service is so slow it‚Äôs incredible
ChIJJ2d_mrsnQg0RuN8PrxwHQPU,4,A bit expensive but still tasty
ChIJJ2d_mrsnQg0RuN8PrxwHQPU,1,"Too bad I can't put zero. The worst Knee in all of Madrid. A rude lady who looks like she is at home serving coffee. Since I told her that the Americano was too weak, she just reluctantly changed it to me, claiming that I was wrong. He kept talking, constantly saying that I didn't know what an American was. Let's see, every day I drink American coffee in several cafes in Rodilla. Bad attention, I don't recommend it."
ChIJJ2d_mrsnQg0RuN8PrxwHQPU,1,"The attention from the saleswoman, a girl with glasses, is unfortunate when you ask her something, she talks to you arrogantly and instead of talking she screams at you, and you ask her to have manners, she screams louder so that all the customers know.
They should select their workers better, because if they come in a bad mood they won't take it out on their clients.
The cappuccino coffee is very liquid."
ChIJJ2d_mrsnQg0RuN8PrxwHQPU,1,"I passed by in the morning at 9:54 and it is closed because they are refilling the sandwiches?? They really fill it at this time, do they really have to close the place when they are supposed to open at 7?? Not three hours and they already close?
How long does it take to fill out and why is there no notice or sign? I have spent other days and they serve me without problems
Today will be something every day with the girl on duty, there won't be time to make up? Come on, it's your job unless you do it efficiently or without inconveniencing customers."
ChIJFdFexsYnQg0RrrYCEKqOzjk,5,Nice food at very low cost
ChIJFdFexsYnQg0RrrYCEKqOzjk,5,"All. I like everything here. The service is excellent, the atmosphere is cozy. Perfect to enjoy a good cup of coffee or to spend a relaxing time with friends. I 100% recommend this place!"
ChIJFdFexsYnQg0RrrYCEKqOzjk,5,"You cannot have breakfast, snack or drink something more comfortable than in this cafeteria. The people who work here are very friendly and professional and always serve you with a smile."
ChIJFdFexsYnQg0RrrYCEKqOzjk,5,"This cafeteria is a place of trust, a place where you will always be well received. Miguel always has a smile and a good gesture, which makes you want to return to this place."
ChIJFdFexsYnQg0RrrYCEKqOzjk,4,"Still in the power of Spaniards and very good people. Unfortunately, in Carabanchel you already have to look for bars or cafes where professionals serve you."
ChIJR7G5k7AnQg0RqjBhLNWOx0k,5,"cheap and delicious coffee, exactly what i expected coming in. the service does not know english but it's really easy to communicate"
ChIJR7G5k7AnQg0RqjBhLNWOx0k,5,very good place
ChIJR7G5k7AnQg0RqjBhLNWOx0k,1,Cafe
ChIJR7G5k7AnQg0RqjBhLNWOx0k,5,"I usually have my coffee before work and it is very delicious.
I have become a regular customer. The attention of Vanesa, Jessy, Deliz and Nuria is magnificent.
Without a doubt a good place to have a coffee or a few mugs of beer. Plus the appetizer is generous."
ChIJR7G5k7AnQg0RqjBhLNWOx0k,4,We spent a few days in Madrid in a dumpy apartment in Usera. This place was our safeguard in the mornings where we had a leisurely breakfast of coffee and a jam and butter croissant from Mercadona.
ChIJt6NG88YnQg0Roqz4mDuh3co,5,Ok
ChIJt6NG88YnQg0Roqz4mDuh3co,5,Neighborhood bar with excellent service from all the staff: friendly and agile. Very good quality food. Very cold bottles. Whenever I'm in the area I try to go
ChIJt6NG88YnQg0Roqz4mDuh3co,5,"We ordered a tortilla skewer and coffee with milk and it was delicious, they make it themselves and they are very delicious! The service was also very good, and the price was around 9 euros for 2 skewers and 2 coffees. Highly recommended"
ChIJt6NG88YnQg0Roqz4mDuh3co,5,"Un bar de toda la vida, buen servicio, los camareros son simp√°ticos y muy atentos, la comida est√° muy buena, el men√∫ una maravilla! Volver√© sin duda, me he sentido como en casa."
ChIJt6NG88YnQg0Roqz4mDuh3co,1,"When we arrived it took a long time for us to sit at a table.
Then they did not clarify to take note since they have been wrong several times.
Even though we were alone, it took more than 1 hour and a half to serve us and when it arrived it was already cold.
The truth is that for the time it took and what they charged us, the food was not that good.
And finally, when they made a mistake serving the food, they got angry with us and did not treat us well.
The truth is that I would not recommend this site."
ChIJm1DqSMEnQg0Rww38g3ojEaE,4,"It's kind new place and have good food for those whom prefer the chicken, it's a good option. Nevertheless for those whom prefer non meatÔºå it's not a recommend place."
ChIJm1DqSMEnQg0Rww38g3ojEaE,5,"I have bought from this place several times and most of the dishes are very good in terms of quality, flavor and quantity. I think the score should be much higher. In addition, their menu is very wide and varied, and I recommend placing orders through the ToGoodToGo application since for ‚Ç¨8 the amount of food is brutal. Their croquettes are 10!"
ChIJm1DqSMEnQg0Rww38g3ojEaE,5,The chicken is good and they add sauce to make it juicier. I ordered the 10 euro pack = whole chicken + potatoes and it was pretty good
ChIJm1DqSMEnQg0Rww38g3ojEaE,3,"Good place to get you out of trouble if you don't have anything prepared to eat. The offers are not bad although the chickens are logically small, but for 2-3 people it will do the trick. The portions are nothing out of this world but by taking the combined offers you don't prepare food for the whole day."
ChIJm1DqSMEnQg0Rww38g3ojEaE,3,"The food is good and abundant. Now, they don't have a single price listed or the name of the dishes. It is difficult to identify, for example, between different salads."
ChIJZZjGSronQg0Rx7mq8cBCzWU,5,"It's such a lovely place and the staff is very helpful. The food was also amazing. Extra thanks to the young man who helped us with our Spanish :)
//The Swedes"
ChIJZZjGSronQg0Rx7mq8cBCzWU,5,"Really great place next to our Airbnb.
We were a group of 6 Greeks and the people in the Bodega welcomed us like their own.
Really affordable cerveceria with amazing  food and tasty tapas. Totally recommend everything!"
ChIJZZjGSronQg0Rx7mq8cBCzWU,5,"Lots of gluten free options available. Services was really kind.
Really got experience. Food was awesome! Definitely will come back!"
ChIJZZjGSronQg0Rx7mq8cBCzWU,5,"Great croquettes made from scratch on the premises. Sepia was soft and well seasoned.

2nd visit. The croquettes are still amazing! Recommend having one of each: Rabo, Queso, Jamon. The baby squid and seared tuna was also excellent."
ChIJZZjGSronQg0Rx7mq8cBCzWU,5,Very nice place in a strange but safe neighborhood. Got a white wine with ice and several tapas. Very friendly. Excellent price open from 10:00am to 2:00am.
ChIJwXW0BLwnQg0R526jiyiuM34,5,Great place to eat and lovely accommodating staff. Good prices.
ChIJwXW0BLwnQg0R526jiyiuM34,4,Great authentic Spanish food! Good service!
ChIJwXW0BLwnQg0R526jiyiuM34,5,Great place for some pork
ChIJwXW0BLwnQg0R526jiyiuM34,5,Super interesting and complete menu.
ChIJwXW0BLwnQg0R526jiyiuM34,5,"Very nice staff, breakfast of 10, incredible service and covered terrace for the cold!"
ChIJj7yBLbonQg0Rg4Gcxppkb7c,5,They have an outdoors heated tent really nice for Madrid‚Äôs winter. Good tapas and dishes. Would recommend to go with friends and share several dishes
ChIJj7yBLbonQg0Rg4Gcxppkb7c,3,"I asked a breakfast with the classic ""barra con tomate"" and coffee and they gave me a funky sauce full of garlic. When I complained the latin girl behind the bar turned her back without even ask if I wanted another one just with tomato as I asked. Needless to say I haven't eaten my bread because it was full of garlic at 7am."
ChIJj7yBLbonQg0Rg4Gcxppkb7c,5,"Wow.. like all galician places it doesn't disappoint.  Huge portions, mouthwatering seafood and excellent value for money.
Great service too!"
ChIJj7yBLbonQg0Rg4Gcxppkb7c,4,"It is a nice restaurant. We order two meals : Pulpo a la gallega
Fritura pescadk
We are very very full with this. XD
I think it is for 4 people to eat XD"
ChIJj7yBLbonQg0Rg4Gcxppkb7c,5,Yummy menu del d√≠a. Great terraza for all year long. Awesome value for the price.
ChIJa9REpbAnQg0RAC74pDCm41E,1,"What a horrible pizza. I had just arrived in Madrid and wanted something quick, but local so I thought I‚Äôd try out this pizza place as I hadn‚Äôt heard of it before. But the second I got it, something was not right. The pizza itself had so many bubbles on it (not from being too hot, but rather chemical it seemed). It definitely didn‚Äôt look right. I took the first bite, and it was horrible. There was a rancid flavour to it. But the weirdest thing was seeing bits of foil and plastic in the same box as my pizza, which led me to wonder how this was even made. I ate one slice and then threw the rest of it away. Not worth spending ¬£20 on this. Should‚Äôve stuck to Dominos or Papa Johns."
ChIJa9REpbAnQg0RAC74pDCm41E,5,The service was amazing and the food was delicious. Definitely coming back.
ChIJa9REpbAnQg0RAC74pDCm41E,5,"The best restauran, I like the food and de service."
ChIJa9REpbAnQg0RAC74pDCm41E,3,"No for the Delicheese.
That they put this under the cheese section is an insult to cheese lovers! It's a tomato pizza with a after thought of cheese.. also commonly known as a Margarita.

The Barbacoa Creme Queso was however worth a few stars.

Since Telepizza decided to make an app without the option to leave opinions I decided to make it here."
ChIJa9REpbAnQg0RAC74pDCm41E,1,Horrible
ChIJVVVVVWUvc7QR4RtX3p7jElA,4,"Pretty good food, but the service is incredibly slow."
ChIJVVVVVWUvc7QR4RtX3p7jElA,5,"My first time having encebollado, was absolutely incredible... Kind waitress, great food, will be back to see what else I've been missing out on."
ChIJVVVVVWUvc7QR4RtX3p7jElA,5,"Great place, great service and most important awesome food"
ChIJVVVVVWUvc7QR4RtX3p7jElA,5,"The place was amazing. Could taste Ecuador with every bite. Highly recommend soupa de encebollado.
Pedro was very helpful."
ChIJVVVVVWUvc7QR4RtX3p7jElA,5,Nicely cooked Dorada in coconut stew üëç
ChIJJfN3AMcnQg0RWB2NsFbnhXI,5,Good roast chicken. They have a very extensive menu of food that they prepare. Very interesting. Good attention.
ChIJJfN3AMcnQg0RWB2NsFbnhXI,1,"All disposable plastic containers. I have gone with my own container, and they tell me that they can only put it in their plastic containers. I ask if they can weigh my container and deduct it from the total (the machines do it automatically) and they tell me that they don't know how to do it.
If you are even remotely concerned about caring for the environment, this is not your place."
ChIJJfN3AMcnQg0RWB2NsFbnhXI,5,"The food is spectacular, it is my go-to place when we can't prepare food at home, highly recommended!!!"
ChIJJfN3AMcnQg0RWB2NsFbnhXI,5,"It is a place for prepared dishes to take home. The food is completely homemade and is delicious!!! They have roast chickens and one day a week they make stew (in both cases it is advisable to order or reserve them in advance, so you don't run out of them). The 2 people who run it are very nice and the customer service is very good. 100% recommended ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJJfN3AMcnQg0RWB2NsFbnhXI,5,"Excellent homemade food! The spectacular roast chicken, as well as whatever you want as a side dish!!! Exquisite personal treatment!! Good discovery! Lol!"
ChIJv7w_ELknQg0RVKxZYd1j9kE,1,"Terrible, frozen fritanga and all the ducks with a tasteless and unnecessary tartar sauce.
To our complaint about how terrible all the frozen and tasteless fish was, his response: wow... We'll have to give the cook a touch... It comes in handy from time to time.....
Call Chicote, the problem is not with the cook..... And they know it"
ChIJv7w_ELknQg0RVKxZYd1j9kE,4,"Great tavern, reasonable prices and quite homemade and natural food. In summer they put up a terrace and it is very good. The area is quite quiet. I recommend ordering tripe in this tavern. The owner is very friendly."
ChIJv7w_ELknQg0RVKxZYd1j9kE,5,I love this tavern and especially its patatas bravas!! Very full plates and good price
ChIJv7w_ELknQg0RVKxZYd1j9kE,5,"We went for breakfast and it was very good.
Yeremi and Milena are very friendly and good professionals."
ChIJv7w_ELknQg0RVKxZYd1j9kE,1,Super unfriendly waiter...people like that should not dedicate themselves to this profession...if you love fried food and frozen products this is your place
ChIJd-r46r4nQg0RbdS0Bxt7kYQ,5,Expectacular
ChIJd-r46r4nQg0RbdS0Bxt7kYQ,5,"Spectacular service, very friendly and fast waitresses. On the other hand, the food was delicious, we ordered a pica√±a snack and the portions were good, the food was super fast.
We also ate an alfajor and it was delicious.
Without a doubt a very good option to go to eat!! Both in quality and price."
ChIJd-r46r4nQg0RbdS0Bxt7kYQ,4,"No waiting, if you arrive early, then it fills up, the service is very good and all the staff are very friendly. Very delicious food and homemade desserts.
I recommend it!!"
ChIJd-r46r4nQg0RbdS0Bxt7kYQ,5,"Very very good experience in this small neighborhood restaurant.
Very good food, the skewers were delicious, the croquettes too as well as the empanadas.
The service was great, waitress very smiling and attentive despite the fact that we did not speak Spanish.
A little noisy atmosphere but very good value for money.
We will come back üôÇ"
ChIJd-r46r4nQg0RbdS0Bxt7kYQ,1,"I loved this place but the truth is that it surprises me how the dishes became smaller and smaller and the food, in this case, the roast was very hard to look at, if they are going to raise the prices, at least it is worth paying for it because it is unfortunate to pay for it."
ChIJIb4gpr8nQg0RYG0u-uTpoGs,4,"Very good food, huge amounts. Very satisfying for when you're craving these types of food."
ChIJIb4gpr8nQg0RYG0u-uTpoGs,5,Super tasty
ChIJIb4gpr8nQg0RYG0u-uTpoGs,5,"We ordered Chinese food for dinner and picked it up at the local, it's really a good idea because if you don't want to come out smelling like fried food, it's best to eat somewhere else. It didn't take them long to place the order, they always give you something like Chinese bread or a soft drink if you exceed a certain minimum order."
ChIJIb4gpr8nQg0RYG0u-uTpoGs,4,"It's my first time eating Chinese food, so I can't compare it or give an expert rating on it, I can only say that I liked it. The tempura shrimp were delicious and had great flavor. The three delicacies rice was delicious, as were the gyozas. The only thing I would fault is that spring roll, which was more meat than anything else. Shipping was fast and service was pleasant."
ChIJIb4gpr8nQg0RYG0u-uTpoGs,5,"We have come to visit Madrid and we have already ordered delivery twice. Our favorite dish is sweet and sour pork, abundant and delicious. We also ordered chicken with almonds and noodles with beef, everything was very good!!! Super recommendedüíúüíúüíúüíú"
ChIJdWDoKLknQg0R8Dpc7XPP01I,5,"Very good treatment, everything clean and good atmosphere üòâ and everyone very friendly"
ChIJdWDoKLknQg0R8Dpc7XPP01I,1,"Unpleasant treatment, disgusting cleaning, they gave us horrible coffee, I went with Italian friends and they made fun of us."
ChIJdWDoKLknQg0R8Dpc7XPP01I,5,"Pleasant service, good food and good price."
ChIJdWDoKLknQg0R8Dpc7XPP01I,4,Very pleasant to deal with.
ChIJdWDoKLknQg0R8Dpc7XPP01I,5,Very good tapas
ChIJMzshX0MnQg0RJudZv1PVIKs,5,"We loved it, the best chuco chicken I have eaten in Madrid, the tamarind juice was tasty and the service was not to mention very friendly. We loved it, my friends and I recommend it."
ChIJMzshX0MnQg0RJudZv1PVIKs,3,"The food is very good but the service not so much, if you want to eat on time you have to arrive an hour early and I am not exaggerating, a few days ago I was there and they had me waiting for an hour for the food, I also recommend bringing earplugs because the music is very loud."
ChIJMzshX0MnQg0RJudZv1PVIKs,3,"Five of us had dinner and we had a positive experience, with ups and downs.

Starting with the best: the food is of good quality, especially the barbecue, which is prepared with care. The quantity is also huge, which is always appreciated, and at a more than reasonable price. Nothing to object there.

Continuing with the negative: the service, at least at first, left something to be desired. The waitress who served us overlooked basic issues, such as giving us cutlery, glasses or plates (to eat the wings, we used napkins as plates). In the end, we had to ask him.

The delivery time was also extremely long, even for an elaborate dish. Fortunately, the good food livened up that aspect.

In general, the balance was positive, and I would repeat my experience here. Everyone has a bad day, and I trust and encourage the team to improve the negative points, because the place is worth it. In addition, the staff is very friendly and they even treated us to some potatoes.

I give it three stars, but I have been tempted to give it 4. Maybe when I repeat!"
ChIJMzshX0MnQg0RJudZv1PVIKs,5,"The food was good and it is a VERY good quantity, so take into account the size of the plate.  The service was good and the time it took was not bad. I recommend the place and even more so if it is in a large group."
ChIJMzshX0MnQg0RJudZv1PVIKs,5,"A very authentic katracha food from Honduras full of flavor and tradition.
Very efficient service and education.
Don't forget to visit this site.
The best chuco chicken I have tried in Madrid."
ChIJ8xwMsL8nQg0RiC1FAs1KPOw,5,Delicious homemade food and lovely service.
ChIJ8xwMsL8nQg0RiC1FAs1KPOw,4,not bad!
ChIJ8xwMsL8nQg0RiC1FAs1KPOw,5,Ok
ChIJ8xwMsL8nQg0RiC1FAs1KPOw,5,"We are from the neighborhood but we didn't know it, we went on a recommendation.
We liked it and decided to celebrate an event there, my son's 18th birthday and it was fantastic, everything was great, service, food, quality and price.
Previously we had eaten from the menu and had dinner from portions, also perfect.
A thousand thanks to Antonio and his attentive and friendly staff.
Clean.
We have no doubt that we will continue visiting them.
One hundred percent recommended!!!"
ChIJ8xwMsL8nQg0RiC1FAs1KPOw,4,"Neighborhood bar, one of those that has been around for a long time, that has managed to build a regular clientele. The waiters, close and friendly, are the best thing the place has. Good prices, very cold beer and correct appetizers; They gave us paella to accompany the drink. Good to have some beers."
ChIJdX89nt0nQg0RAZNswZiUwcQ,5,"A pleasant atmosphere, personalized attention and very good Peruvian food.  The ceviche is very fresh."
ChIJdX89nt0nQg0RAZNswZiUwcQ,5,"Peruvian restaurant with high quality dishes and very affordable prices. The causa acevichada is especially recommended. The frying point of the fish is also excellent. The service is excellent too, with very attentive waiters."
ChIJdX89nt0nQg0RAZNswZiUwcQ,5,"Excellent, very, very delicious food, generous portions and at a good price. The attentive and friendly staff...your trusted Peruvian restaurant in the neighborhood."
ChIJdX89nt0nQg0RAZNswZiUwcQ,5,"I've been there twice and it's very, very good üëå, we ordered salted loin with chaufa rice and salted noodles (both √† la carte) and I found that delicious flavor like in Peru here.
The second time I went, it was during the week and there was a single dish menu for ‚Ç¨5 and it was nothing more than pickled chicken, ufff it was delicious and they serve very filling, we are delighted with this place, obviously we will continue to return.
Super friendly and helpful staff."
ChIJdX89nt0nQg0RAZNswZiUwcQ,4,"The atmosphere was nice and cozy and the rest of the food tasted good, the only downside was I ate a lomo saltado and the meat was not loin. Hard and dry.  Everything else like the delicious lucuma dessert."
ChIJcfChBbknQg0RIkpXkXt9WaU,5,"We enjoyed a fabulous meal here, ham for starters, followed by Swordfish steak...finished with tiramasu.  All delicious and very good price.   Highly recommend."
ChIJcfChBbknQg0RIkpXkXt9WaU,5,"Great food, good prices and
Great atmosphere. We will be back!"
ChIJcfChBbknQg0RIkpXkXt9WaU,4,Wonderful typical spanish bar with great tapas and fantastic beers
ChIJcfChBbknQg0RIkpXkXt9WaU,5,Good tapas and raciones. Great price.
ChIJcfChBbknQg0RIkpXkXt9WaU,5,Great outdoor seating
ChIJgXnVCLwnQg0RXqDZz6vYSJs,5,"A perfect place, small as town is."
ChIJgXnVCLwnQg0RXqDZz6vYSJs,5,Fantastic
ChIJgXnVCLwnQg0RXqDZz6vYSJs,5,I have eaten from the menu on Kings Day and the experience has been excellent both in terms of treatment and food. I recommend it üíØ the first spoon dishes like the traditional cuisine and its spectacular stews and roasts
ChIJgXnVCLwnQg0RXqDZz6vYSJs,5,Super complete and very good menu. Good treatment on the terrace/tent where they treated us with great art.üëå
ChIJgXnVCLwnQg0RXqDZz6vYSJs,4,"The menu is quite good with variety and good quantities, although the price is somewhat higher than average (12 at that time per menu). They serve you well and you can eat comfortably on the terrace in summer. Important detail such as using specific cutlery depending on whether it is meat or fish."
ChIJ6ba-uEsnQg0RbIgz8cr8sdU,5,"My fiance and I, we love having our breakfast at Josepan in the mornings.
We are very well attended by anyone of the employees there, Mainly Gustavo and Jason. ;)"
ChIJ6ba-uEsnQg0RbIgz8cr8sdU,5,Excelent breakfast with a good custom service. All employes very kind and professional.
ChIJ6ba-uEsnQg0RbIgz8cr8sdU,1,"I went to this place with my family,  the waiter did not want to sit my cousin down. Then ignored us the whole time.  We ended up just ordering at the counter since the waiter did not come once in 30 minutes to ask us what we would like and took care of everyone else that came in after us."
ChIJ6ba-uEsnQg0RbIgz8cr8sdU,5,This place everything is.delicious great workers fast  service
ChIJ6ba-uEsnQg0RbIgz8cr8sdU,3,Food portion are small for the price and expensive! LECHONA
ChIJi37PlS4nQg0RpjwGdH9thJs,5,I ate kebab in many country‚Äôs in Europe but this is the best kebab for It's masala and atmosphere. I recommended all to try kebab and pollo frito in this place.
ChIJi37PlS4nQg0RpjwGdH9thJs,5,Can check out unless you don‚Äôt have any other options ‚ò∫Ô∏è
ChIJi37PlS4nQg0RpjwGdH9thJs,5,Very good
ChIJi37PlS4nQg0RpjwGdH9thJs,5,Very good
ChIJi37PlS4nQg0RpjwGdH9thJs,5,Good
ChIJvfD2CL4nQg0Rvsm8vNJZN8w,5,Super
ChIJvfD2CL4nQg0Rvsm8vNJZN8w,3,"I ordered padr√≥n peppers and they were ‚Ç¨8.5 for 17 peppers counted, it seemed like a tapa.
The beer, red wine and white wine are very well priced, they even give you a tapa if you don't order something to eat of course.
The black pudding was ‚Ç¨7.5 and it looks disappointing, expect a little more for what you pay and it looks like a tapa instead of a portion.
I would only return for the drink because the rest is the same as anywhere but less quantity and higher price but good.
Furthermore, the letter does not include any of the 14 mandatory intolerances that must be included.
They have different prices in box, menu and blackboard.
Adequate attention but exaggerated prices compared to what they serve you."
ChIJvfD2CL4nQg0Rvsm8vNJZN8w,4,"Neighborhood bar, with all the good things that implies. They have a menu made up of sandwiches, toasts and various portions. We ordered some patatas bravas, some calamari and some chicken wings to share between four people: good flavor, good quantity and quick service. The wings had a thick and crispy batter, which was what I liked the most. ‚Ç¨10 per person, a fairly reasonable price. We liked it. Recommended, good for having a few beers and snacks with friends."
ChIJvfD2CL4nQg0Rvsm8vNJZN8w,4,"I love this place!!!!!!, the food is wonderful and they serve you with great affection, you feel at home.
It is a family Bar/Restaurant, small but very cozy, if you are around, don't hesitate and stop by to eat, you will thank me."
ChIJvfD2CL4nQg0Rvsm8vNJZN8w,4,"It is a simple place, with a town feel (in the best sense of the comparison). The service was very good, and the breakfast was simply delicious!!! Very good value for money."
ChIJWYjfGAAnQg0RypnaPpkROt4,5,"Everything is the best, both the environment and the service and of course the food. Everything is very tasty, the service is very good, they stand out for their culture, politeness, and the rules of how to treat guests. The most important thing in this area, as for the bar, is a very quiet and peaceful environment.
I thank Giorgi and Naniko for everything‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJWYjfGAAnQg0RypnaPpkROt4,5,the best Bar in madrid !
ChIJWYjfGAAnQg0RypnaPpkROt4,5,"A true gem for lovers of good rice. From the first bite you can see the love, the technique and the quality of the ingredients. The atmosphere is cozy, the service impeccable and the attention to detail makes the experience unforgettable. I especially recommend the rice with lobster ‚Äî simply spectacular. Without a doubt, a place to return to again and again."
ChIJWYjfGAAnQg0RypnaPpkROt4,5,Neighborhood place that is a success. It is already the third rice we have tried and each time tastier. The cook Nico is attentive to your taste and without a doubt makes some magnificent rice dishes and comes out to ask what the tastes are. Recommended site
ChIJWYjfGAAnQg0RypnaPpkROt4,5,"Pleasant surprise and a spectacular change compared to the previous business. Just to say that with the previous owners I went once and never came back... But this time the experience has been completely different.

The rice was delicious, nothing to envy of renowned rice restaurants in Madrid. Nico, the cook, is a true artist, and Mauricio's service has been impeccable, with attention out of 10. In addition, the atmosphere is very pleasant, and the terrace is wonderful to enjoy a good lunch or dinner.

Without a doubt, a place to repeat."
ChIJ94PT_L0nQg0RlytBw6G9Ex4,5,Good food
ChIJ94PT_L0nQg0RlytBw6G9Ex4,5,Good place for dinner
ChIJ94PT_L0nQg0RlytBw6G9Ex4,5,Ok
ChIJ94PT_L0nQg0RlytBw6G9Ex4,5,"Excellent food and treatment!!! Super friendly and helpful; The burgers are a sure hit, the quality meat super delicious. They make you feel at home."
ChIJ94PT_L0nQg0RlytBw6G9Ex4,5,"Great homemade food and friendly, attentive and fast service.
All the dishes are delicious, but the paella on Thursdays is on another level!!!"
ChIJjd9Ey70nQg0RNoLCzsqzd-s,5,Really delicious pupusa me and curtido! Home made. They had pupusas with a zucchini and cheese option too. Delicious and just right. Not overstuffed! Fresh
ChIJjd9Ey70nQg0RNoLCzsqzd-s,5,"A true jewel in this area. The food tastes authentic and you feel that the friendly staff is really passionate about what they are cooking. There is a large variety of food and even vegan and vegetarians will find satisfying and budget friendly cuisine here, I will definitely come back!"
ChIJjd9Ey70nQg0RNoLCzsqzd-s,1,"They dare to call themselves a Salvadoran Pupuseria, however service has to be one the worst in Madrid. Food is always late. The waitress/waiters have a big Nopal in the forehead (they seem to have forgotten  that) and want to talk like Spaniards. Not to mention, the only Salvadorans products they got are a bunch of expired bags of chips. Finally the food isn't as great as it should be. I firmly believe that ALL Salvadorans miss El Salvador and feel like this place gives them that feeling of being back home. Short summary, avoid going to this Pupuseria.."
ChIJjd9Ey70nQg0RNoLCzsqzd-s,5,Delicious Central American cuisine! This area boasts a variety of fantastic restaurants. I highly recommend it!
ChIJjd9Ey70nQg0RNoLCzsqzd-s,5,Very good PUPUSAS! The pupusa de camar√≥n was great and the revuelta was also very good! I'd definitely recommend.
ChIJn5XQXpUnQg0RsK2Hryw7LI4,5,We ordered the chicken strips and fries to go. It was very good. The chicken is breaded lightly and it comes with a creamy sauce that was good. The cost was $10 euros. The service was fast and friendly.
ChIJn5XQXpUnQg0RsK2Hryw7LI4,4,Good place for Spanish food and beers at the terrace
ChIJn5XQXpUnQg0RsK2Hryw7LI4,5,"Brutal place to eat homemade food, abundant and very good dishes, very friendly and kind waiters. I recommend the chicken strips with honey and mustard sauce and the broken eggs with chorizos in cider, but the star dish is the brutal cachopo, impress you as a single dish for two people and the fabulous natural cider, 100% recommended ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJn5XQXpUnQg0RsK2Hryw7LI4,1,"Other Christmas bandits, what a month ago cost ‚Ç¨6 is now ‚Ç¨8, do not admit criticism because by saying affection, love... etc. they already think they gain in kindness. But that is gained with good work, for True, in a year I don't keep count but 20 waiters will have passed by, taking advantage of the government's advantages. Real sinvers......By the way, the ‚Ç¨8 are for a dic with cola, the bottle costs 10 or ‚Ç¨11, that's a steal."
ChIJn5XQXpUnQg0RsK2Hryw7LI4,4,It has rooms for small reserved rooms. The food was good and the service too. Very good cannelloni
ChIJgYeWi2gnQg0RkAMgOLwxCMM,3,Good
ChIJgYeWi2gnQg0RkAMgOLwxCMM,5,"We stopped for a coffee and a drink after eating, and we were very comfortable: they have a very large outdoor terrace in a square right in front. Fairly reasonable prices (‚Ç¨1.50 for coffee and ‚Ç¨6 for a well-poured whiskey) and, above all, we liked the attention of the waiter, attentive and friendly. They had several traditional food options. A place to which we will return. üëå"
ChIJgYeWi2gnQg0RkAMgOLwxCMM,4,"The place is worth it, but sometimes there is only one waitress to serve a large number of people and, although they do not lose their smile and do the best they can, logically the waiting times get longer and they also have a hard time. It would be good to reconsider having more waiters at those times of large crowds.
Of course, it is eaten very well and at an affordable price."
ChIJgYeWi2gnQg0RkAMgOLwxCMM,5,"We went to eat menu of the day for ‚Ç¨10
Everything was delicious, each dish better than the last. Fresh products, the asparagus was delicious, so much so that my companions stole it from my plate hehehe
The sea bass was just right, the grilled chicken breast was perfect, not dry at all. Homemade fries. Rich desserts, if you like rich chocolate cake, I'll stick with the apple one although I wouldn't add syrup.
Highlight good service, the guy was attentive and made sure we didn't miss anything. They gave us takeaway coffee without any problem. Very good neighborhood bar."
ChIJgYeWi2gnQg0RkAMgOLwxCMM,5,"Very well served, good service and comfortable place. Super delicious food! I recommend"
ChIJPb2Z08MnQg0R5om4sZP-xz0,1,"I went to the restaurant for breakfast on the recommendation of another person, according to what they told me they have 4 restaurants, I ordered bread with pork rinds and pataca, they brought the American coffee for which we were waiting a long time, I asked if it would take longer, the waitress told me that it was already leaving at that moment I saw a cockroach on the wall on the side where I was sitting, if that cockroach is where it is very cold, what is the kitchen like? I called the waitress and told her how much I owed for the coffee that will cancel the entire order because there is a cockroach on the wall, she responded like if nothing happened and he didn't even bother to kill the ü™≤ that was still there."
ChIJPb2Z08MnQg0R5om4sZP-xz0,5,"Very satisfied with the food, the waitresses are very nice and the seasoning is highly recommended üòé‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•"
ChIJPb2Z08MnQg0R5om4sZP-xz0,1,"The worst service, the more they spend time talking, today I ordered an a la carte menu, I waited 25 minutes and the order was given to another customer and then I complained to them and she accepted that she was wrong to serve the a la carte menu and told me If I want I have to wait another 20 minutes, the worst part is that they didn't apologize, I recommend if you want to waste time and money go to the restaurant"
ChIJPb2Z08MnQg0R5om4sZP-xz0,2,They gave me a raw ceviche without salt and it seemed like they added acid instead of lemon and the attention was rather less
ChIJPb2Z08MnQg0R5om4sZP-xz0,4,"We were 6 friends to eat ceviche and without a doubt it is a good ceviche, good customer service, very nice waitresses and the price is good since Latin restaurants serve a good portion of food, I will return and the 6 of us will be less than ‚Ç¨100"
ChIJHWC8WkcnQg0RqquFFvY6lJU,5,"The site has a Latin atmosphere with an emphasis on Cuban. The people in charge of serving customers are very helpful and friendly.

The food is on another level. I ordered ribs with patacones; The ribs were a good size, crispy and the flavor was spectacular. Likewise, the patacones were large and had great seasoning. They also offer typical dishes such as Ropa Vieja, meat and yuca, which adds authenticity to their Cuban menu.

The restaurant is clean and well maintained, with tables in good condition. The atmosphere is pleasant, with background music at a low volume that allows for comfortable conversations.

It is a recommended place to go to dinner with several people, since the portions are quite large. The price is very reasonable, with an average cost of 15 euros per person, which offers excellent value for money considering the quantity and quality of the food.

In short, La Bodeguita Cubana offers an authentic culinary experience in a pleasant and clean environment, with affordable prices. It is ideal for those looking to enjoy Cuban flavors in an environment that facilitates conversation and coexistence."
ChIJHWC8WkcnQg0RqquFFvY6lJU,5,"I loved it, the dinner is as if I had eaten in Cuba üá®üá∫, the attention of the waitress was spectacular and the owner was super nice. I give it a 150/100. I give the cook a 200/100, as we say in Cuba, she's on the run in the kitchen hahahaha"
ChIJHWC8WkcnQg0RqquFFvY6lJU,5,"Good bar, today I went with my girlfriend and we had a great time.
Triple B: good, pretty and cheap.
The very nice waiters encouraged us to have shots"
ChIJHWC8WkcnQg0RqquFFvY6lJU,5,The food was spectacular and the waitress's service was excellent. A real Cuban food restaurant. Congratulations to the Spanish manager for his team work group. We are happy. Thank you all.
ChIJHWC8WkcnQg0RqquFFvY6lJU,5,"Good atmosphere, good music. delicious barbecues. Fresh beer, mojitos üòõ Good treatment with the owners and waiters. They have a private room for celebrations"
ChIJpcb39TcnQg0R_nBchAMHPXs,5,"Very nice place to eal wih locals. Food was superb.  Very big portions, never order big, just choose mediumüôÇ. Sunday is poke day, they have special prices if you choose from menu"

ChIJ67Uq6MEnQg0RK8d6N6u57MA,5,"We are from Valencia, we found it by chance searching on Google, from minute 1 on the charming call.
The food was delicious, the cocktails were beyond words and without a doubt the wonderful service I will definitely repeat and of course recommend."
ChIJ67Uq6MEnQg0RK8d6N6u57MA,5,"Very good Cuban food, great service from everyone!"
ChIJ67Uq6MEnQg0RK8d6N6u57MA,5,"I have had lunch/dinner here a couple of times with friends, and delighted. The meat has a very good quality/price ratio, and the mamajuana they serve is a danger! The attention they have given me is good, polite and kind."
ChIJ67Uq6MEnQg0RK8d6N6u57MA,5,Experience of 10! Best tamales in Madrid!! 100% recommended! Thank you for making us feel at home.

ChIJgyNpYZYnQg0RGjlXrXkkFm0,5,"Went on a Friday night to play Bingo for the first time ever! A great place with great food and my experience was enhanced by my waitress Elena, who was a great all night. I will be back!"

ChIJgyNpYZYnQg0RGjlXrXkkFm0,5,"Very good atmosphere, very nice employees, super affordable prices (cocacola ‚Ç¨1.5).
As for bingo, it costs ‚Ç¨2 per card. It is computerized so the prizes are awarded automatically and you must claim it. On Sundays there are extra raffles of up to ‚Ç¨1000
I recommend to have a fun time and bet a little. Always in moderation."
ChIJXU_adbwnQg0RTpBVq889_I0,4,"Had a tortilla, croissant and tea while waiting for my bus to Toledo. Classical Spanish bar/cafe."
ChIJXU_adbwnQg0RTpBVq889_I0,5,"Very simple, beautiful and not expensive cafeteria or a Bar whatever we wanna call it
Typical Spanish food that one looks for
Perfect summer day with my team started with food here."
ChIJXU_adbwnQg0RTpBVq889_I0,5,"Really nice customer service, typical Spanish food, great and very cheap breakfast, also amazing croissant and cafe"
ChIJXU_adbwnQg0RTpBVq889_I0,5,Delicious coffee and delicious churros with amazing services make my morning happy-go-lucky.
ChIJXU_adbwnQg0RTpBVq889_I0,2,Pricey (2‚Ç¨ for a 200ml coke). Bathroom is literally locked with metal bars and you need a key to use it.
ChIJe-HaEegnQg0RBamf2QVCz0w,5,"Very lively Dominican bar. Good people, good music. Picapollo, picat√≥, sancocho... üòã fresh üçª"
ChIJe-HaEegnQg0RBamf2QVCz0w,1,"Well wow!!!!! Shit... we went with my group of friends about, and it turns out that it's closed so update on Google, and they don't advertise as much on tic tok if they don't open, what a disappointment"
ChIJe-HaEegnQg0RBamf2QVCz0w,5,We were there celebrating a birthday and it was really great. Very good food and excellent service. we will return!! all the best.
ChIJe-HaEegnQg0RBamf2QVCz0w,4,"It's more of a pub than a restaurant. We ordered a picato, very delicious and a lot of variety and quite generous. The moriso√±ando a little expensive the truth. I give 4 stars because it took almost 1 hour to prepare it."
ChIJe-HaEegnQg0RBamf2QVCz0w,5,"Excellent Dominican atmosphere, ideal for birthdays and eating a delicacy in the style of the beautiful Quisqueya. You must try the picato' it's incredible!!"
ChIJt6NGyuonQg0RgeCaoz0ifRU,5,"New ownership and were not sure if we could eat in or only takeaway.... We ate in, personal service as we were the only ones there but the food was great. All made in-house, samoosas, mixed grill,sauces and naans were all very good. Ceiling needs a new lick of paint to sproos it up a bit..."
ChIJt6NGyuonQg0RgeCaoz0ifRU,2,"Ordered on Glovo. The restaurant has own delivery, hence impossible to track the progress. Ordered because of short delivery time, ordered took much longer than promised. Food is OK, very average. Portions are small. Definitely overpriced and overrated on both Glovo and Uber Eats. Not ordering from them again‚Ä¶"
ChIJt6NGyuonQg0RgeCaoz0ifRU,1,"Sad to say this is not good. The curries are very oily and extremely bland, the food is absolutely not worth the money it costs. On Glovo they‚Äôve changed their name to ‚ÄúIndia Bistro‚Äù and the pictures have nothing to do with the actual food you get. I don‚Äôt recommend it."
ChIJt6NGyuonQg0RgeCaoz0ifRU,1,"Ordered from Uber eats. The Tika masala was so sweet, it seemed like a desert. Never ordering here again."
ChIJt6NGyuonQg0RgeCaoz0ifRU,1,"Expensive and very bad! They don‚Äôt honor the food that is shown on Uber eats, upselling sides. Took an hour more than expected as per the app also. Naan bread was bad and rice was terrible."
ChIJc9W4A8AnQg0RaHMAtmlmMFw,5,I loved it! I stumbled upon it by chance. Luis's attention was excellent and very fast and delicious coffee. Typical Madrid neighborhood bar.
ChIJc9W4A8AnQg0RaHMAtmlmMFw,2,"I went attracted by its name of 'pizzeria' but we discovered that the pizzas are made on a frozen base, so I ordered some bravas and a habanero sandwich, theoretically the most complete (and expensive) on the menu (‚Ç¨8), with ham, egg, bacon, lettuce, asparagus and mayonnaise. Being a neighborhood bar, I was surprised that the sandwich arrived practically empty, with hardly any meat. My experience was to eat a lettuce and boiled egg sandwich, because the rest was worthless, and I left starving.
It's a shame that by scratching a couple of slices of ham and bacon you feel like you've been scammed. If I give two stars and not one it is because the waiter was agile and friendly. In any case I would not return."
ChIJc9W4A8AnQg0RaHMAtmlmMFw,1,"The service was good, but what I ordered was horrible, we ordered two pizzas that we thought would be homemade, they are and taste like they were bought from the supermarket or wherever, and the time we waited for the pizza is not worth it at all if it is not homemade"
ChIJc9W4A8AnQg0RaHMAtmlmMFw,5,"The waiters are all super friendly!! The delicious food. The weekend menu for 12.50 with coffee, dessert and shot too. The portions are large and everything is very delicious. During the week. They have a pizza + soft drink offer for 7.50 starting at 6:00 p.m. Thank you and see you soon."
ChIJc9W4A8AnQg0RaHMAtmlmMFw,1,"Be careful if you buy go to go in this place, they send water with egg and bread 4 churros thrown directly into a plastic bag for ‚Ç¨8"
ChIJuxkvXCQnQg0Rro_0Xs6oaAE,5,"Excellent good atmosphere and delicious dinner, congratulations"
ChIJuxkvXCQnQg0Rro_0Xs6oaAE,4,"Beers, wines and good snacks

ChIJKbBckZsnQg0RoLc0DrwC4Eo,4,"Affordable prices and good ecuatorian food. It was a Peruvian restaurant before, so I went there expecting my Ceviche. Instead had hornado and Bandera. Good taste, nothing fancy. Affordable prices and casual ambience. There is no etiquette: they brought two dishes but separately so the first one had to wait a long time for the second and got cold... The intention was good in bringing the dish as it was ready but it creates an uncomfortable situation for two hungry people having to wait with one dish on the table while the other one arrives... Still, nice food."
ChIJKbBckZsnQg0RoLc0DrwC4Eo,5,A generous serving of Chaulafan!
ChIJKbBckZsnQg0RoLc0DrwC4Eo,4,It is fine
ChIJKbBckZsnQg0RoLc0DrwC4Eo,1,"I complained to him because at lunch there is saut√©ed loin and it comes with two strips of meat and a lot of onion and raw pepper. Don't come here. God forgive me, but I'm not the one to talk about the food, but when it's horrible, it's horrible. Don't come here if you don't want to. get angry
Jelly stands up rubber today December 10, 2024 at 3:35 p.m."
ChIJKbBckZsnQg0RoLc0DrwC4Eo,5,"Very pleasant service, fabulous attention, the owner is spectacular and very attentive, the music was very good, the lunch and dinner were delicious ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJSZ2snvcnQg0RilbpCer9lGE,5,Very large portions and great soup
ChIJSZ2snvcnQg0RilbpCer9lGE,3,"We went to Jamafusion Carabanchel with a reservation for 6 people and the food was excellent. We ordered chicken and beef airport, ceviche carretillero, grilled mostrito, broster, anticuchos with rachi, mixed scrambled eggs and two jars of chicha morada, and everything was delicious, with very good flavor and well presented.

However, customer service left something to be desired. Despite having a reservation, the first waitress was upset when we asked for a slightly larger table and kept us waiting for about 15 minutes. Finally, another colleague, who was already finishing her shift, was the one who kindly helped us. Our waiter was friendly, but a bit slow in service.

In summary, the dining experience was a 10, but the service could improve a lot to live up to the food. I would return for the food, hoping for better service next time."
ChIJSZ2snvcnQg0RilbpCer9lGE,5,"Very good experience, a lot of variety of dishes, the brutal cheese tequelo and special wantan soup, dessert cream turned, very good, fast service and the waitress Mariana, very friendly and professional in her work, 100% recommended ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJSZ2snvcnQg0RilbpCer9lGE,2,"At the Carabanchel location I had a normal breakfast, at night I wanted to repeat it to see if it was as good as it appears on social media and I went to the Vallecas location, here very bad, they treated me as ignorant and I know how vegetables are made because I am from the union"
ChIJSZ2snvcnQg0RilbpCer9lGE,5,"First time we eat Peruvian food and it is spectacular. The ceviche was very delicious as a starter and as a main course a beef combination. As a drink, the beer with passion fruit is very delicious. The waitress Alison was very attentive recommending the dishes. Looking forward to trying the beef soup next time"
ChIJ4cwuVj0nQg0RUnSuWzpbVao,5,It's a very good place as a cafeteria at a bus station could ever be. I ate a tasty quick breakfast and had a very nice cup of coffee. The staff is very polite but may not be nice to everyone because they are simply tired. Please understand other people's mood and don't write bad comments because you didn't like how they look at you :)
ChIJ4cwuVj0nQg0RUnSuWzpbVao,4,"Site located in the heart of the Plaza El√≠ptica station. The service has been very good, the porras and churros were crispy, for the toast you could choose the type of bread you wanted for it.

An ideal place to have something light."
ChIJ4cwuVj0nQg0RUnSuWzpbVao,1,I can't give less stars.... You order a coffee with milk and they give you a shot at a price of ‚Ç¨1.30. This apart from how stale the two that are serving at this time are...
ChIJ4cwuVj0nQg0RUnSuWzpbVao,1,"Terrible service. The lady at the bar. Short blonde hair. I asked him for a breakfast with an infusion and not with coffee and he told me no because he had already put the coffee in the machine and it was already brewed. He gave me breakfast with coffee and I had told him I wanted the infusion. The coffee does not come out of the bar, I think it is possible to change it. But he told me directly that he was not giving me the infusion because he had already made the coffee and had already paid. I took the toast and left the coffee there. Coffee makes me sick. It gives me tachycardia and she didn't want to change my coffee. Apart from terrible service, he is a bad person. I will not return."
ChIJ4cwuVj0nQg0RUnSuWzpbVao,1,"No professionalism offered by the waitress behind the bar last Sunday afternoon. He shook his head at me in a bad way when I approached my companion, who was next to the bar having a quick coffee, because they were already closing. My intention was not to drink anything, but simply accompany him until he finished his consumption, but a crude and unpleasant atmosphere was created. Of course I won't be back, so they have lost two customers."
ChIJ3VDNNrMnQg0RHzD7Rgjpru4,1,"The service was awful, we had to be begging for ordering something. We ordered octopus with smash potatoes and the potatoes tasted disgusting like they kept for days, even the smell was obvious that they were bad. We asked them to change it and they offered fries and since I couldn‚Äôt eat fries they didn‚Äôt offer anything else or a discount. La parrillada de verduras was also full of oil. Very unpleasant experience for the prices."
ChIJ3VDNNrMnQg0RHzD7Rgjpru4,5,Meals here are always great and delicious so i keep going back
ChIJ3VDNNrMnQg0RHzD7Rgjpru4,2,"Our waitress was very rude & unkind towards us, first by being impatient with us ordering - we are not from spain and didn‚Äôt understand the menu, even with one of being a native spanish speaker, so we required some extra time, although the waitress tutted & stormed off when asked. when we ordered drinks she snatched the wine glasses away rudely, and also when delivering food. Perhaps she was having a bad day although as someone who worked as a waitress for many years, she must not take that out on customers. When paying she also was annoyed when we selected to use my currency on the card machine -it gives you the option to choose euros or pounds to take from my card, so i selected pounds, and she claimed we couldn‚Äôt use my currency despite it being an option, and it being the same amount of euros payed. this hasn‚Äôt been an issue for any other restaurant we have visited, as it doesn‚Äôt affect the business. This option just means it doesn‚Äôt charge me for a conversion cost. There was another member of staff who was kind, perhaps a manager as she was not in uniform. she was very kind & attentive for the small interaction we had. The first meal - salmon, was very tasty and we enjoyed very much. The second dish, the pasta was okay, cooked well but too much gulas. dessert was the best part, we enjoyed ice cream & arroz con leche. the price was decent and affordable."
ChIJ3VDNNrMnQg0RHzD7Rgjpru4,5,"The best food I've ever eaten in Spain üòç great steak, cooked perfectly!"
ChIJ3VDNNrMnQg0RHzD7Rgjpru4,5,"The best ""huevos estrellados"" in Madrid. It's a dish with French fries and fried eggs all mixed. Incredibly yummy. Normally you should order one dish for two people.
After that you can order meat or fish. Anything will pleased you for sure. Cod is awesome, and calamari also, but meat is their speciality.
It's a place you should come if you are in Madrid for an authentic Spanish food."
ChIJaQGHS00mQg0Re8LP9GIl64Y,3,Typical Spanish. You got what you went there for. No complaints
ChIJaQGHS00mQg0Re8LP9GIl64Y,5,"Excellent, tasty food. A little bit expensive"
ChIJaQGHS00mQg0Re8LP9GIl64Y,5,"The place so so, but the food!!!! BEST EVER AND HUGE DISHES üíïüíïüíï"

ChIJaQGHS00mQg0Re8LP9GIl64Y,5,Perfect
ChIJRxrSJbAnQg0RlNvxJKrfMNQ,3,"Very typical Spanish cafeter√≠a. Tortilla was delicious but coffee, cleanliness and service left a bit to be desired for."
ChIJRxrSJbAnQg0RlNvxJKrfMNQ,5,"Pure neighborhood tapas experience. Amazing tortilla, fried sardines, service.  10/10"
ChIJRxrSJbAnQg0RlNvxJKrfMNQ,5,Ok
ChIJRxrSJbAnQg0RlNvxJKrfMNQ,5,Ok
ChIJRxrSJbAnQg0RlNvxJKrfMNQ,1,"Frozen milk-based lasagna. It tasted like absolutely nothing, not even flour."
ChIJN9TYUU0mQg0Rs_Wg6zJ2ZEM,4,"I tried to be as objective as possible, but the food here is mediocre. The restaurant‚Äôs name said Cantonese so I was expecting a full on Cantonese experience, but they just stuffed a lot of Chinese food on the menu to accommodate local Spanish taste (I supposed).
One of the highlights has to be the bubble egg waffle that overshine every other appetizers and main dish we ordered.
We were 6, so we ordered quite a decent amount of food. The shrimp dumplings (hagao) has good quality shrimp, but the dough was too thick and chewy. The Cantonese noodle roll (cheung fun) was also the same.
The service was good.
The atmosphere was a little too much for my taste, but I loved the lazy Susan. It‚Äôs not a Chinese restaurant unless there‚Äôs a round table with a lazy Susan (unless it‚Äôs hotpot or table for 2/4).
Good experience, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone else who wants good Cantonese food."
ChIJN9TYUU0mQg0Rs_Wg6zJ2ZEM,2,"Did not like the experience.

The service was professional and good, but that was the only positive.
The food was very boring, and very little.
The woke dish was not worth 15‚Ç¨.

90% of the Dim Sum, say Langostino or something else in the title, but if you read the ingredients almost all are based on pork meat.
Not a nice atmosphere either and a very unfavourable value for money proposition."
ChIJN9TYUU0mQg0Rs_Wg6zJ2ZEM,3,"Nice staff (they let me in without a booking for a short time before the booking came). Fast service.
The dim sum was great but the second dish with lot of bones!!!
The sweet chocolete balls good.
Chinese beer tasty. Prices are ok. The atmosphere not that great when it.s crowded."
ChIJN9TYUU0mQg0Rs_Wg6zJ2ZEM,4,Food taste authentic but a bit salty. Overall fine. Dessert selection reminds of the ones back in S.E Asia
ChIJN9TYUU0mQg0Rs_Wg6zJ2ZEM,3,"Was quite excited to eat here as I saw they had ‚Äúhainanese chicken‚Äù which I love and never find here. When the dish came, it was half bones and half chicken and didn‚Äôt come with any rice. The flavour was average but the fact that I had to keep removing bones wasn‚Äôt great. I had also ordered some gyozas which were alright, not great but alright."
ChIJf17927MnQg0RNo9Fs6xpQmA,4,"They have good manager, ther food was acceptable, but every thing be should
more clean."
ChIJf17927MnQg0RNo9Fs6xpQmA,3,Doesn't accept credit card only cash so ensure you have cash
ChIJf17927MnQg0RNo9Fs6xpQmA,5,Nice Restaurant.
ChIJf17927MnQg0RNo9Fs6xpQmA,4,"Quite delicious and a lot of people, very friendly except that they didn't give anything for the salad, neither salt nor oils. They also don't accept card payment which I thought was a bit strange. Recommended to try empanada zagros."
ChIJf17927MnQg0RNo9Fs6xpQmA,1,"Kebab restaurant located near the Usera metro exit.
After waiting more than 15 minutes at the counter, I ordered a plate of food (no menu). When they were going to bring out my plate, the cook asked me if I wanted a drink, since according to him it was included in the plate (a total lie). They made me pay after eating, probably because they knew they were lying to me. In the end I was forced to pay for the drink too.
The food was decent, just any kebab."
ChIJH-H1j8knQg0Roqk8VGt3U44,1,"I went to eat with my family around 6 oclock on the 6th of January  2022 (Dominos Pizza Calle Antonio Lopez Madrid) and we're threated like garbish by the person who claimed to be the GM at that moment (Cintia), she was very disrecpetful and racist towards my family. I asked beforehand if it was ok for to stay there  even tho I wasn't going to eat and they said it was fine. The GM came up to me saying that I had to pay for staying there which I tho it was nuts, due to the fact that I asked on the first place if it was fine. Between, Roc√≠o did a great job. I work in the industry myself and I treat everyone equality despite their race or Ethnicity. I hope Dominos takes actions or I will do a marketing campaign myself."
ChIJH-H1j8knQg0Roqk8VGt3U44,5,"Very good outlet for pizza lovers. It taste super good, we tried few stores in Madrid, and were never satisfied but when we tried this place, we loved it."
ChIJH-H1j8knQg0Roqk8VGt3U44,1,Waiting 15 minutes at the balcony while the restaurant is open and no one appeared to make our order. At 6pm.
ChIJH-H1j8knQg0Roqk8VGt3U44,5,Very popular with the locals. Fast speedy service and good food. The guy who seems to be the manager even knows some English. Very helpful staff. Would recommend.

ChIJFZWXBLQnQg0RuC81wH4SkpA,4,Eggs over Potatoes a real must. Delicious üòã
ChIJFZWXBLQnQg0RuC81wH4SkpA,4,Very good spanish food. I'd say it is kind of expensive due to the restaurant's location (11‚Ç¨ daily menu/16‚Ç¨-20‚Ç¨ weekend menu). Waitresses were very kind and good attention.
ChIJFZWXBLQnQg0RuC81wH4SkpA,5,"Awesome restaurant, hidden gem. Great menu, fantastic service, great food, wine drinks, children friendly. Great desert's, awesome meals, overall fantastic."

ChIJ0QZb9LMnQg0R3x335Es54AE,1,Dirty! Rubbish everywhere. Filthy floor.
ChIJ0QZb9LMnQg0R3x335Es54AE,4,Food was good but the location not the cleanest
ChIJfRaqCMonQg0RfrB2ptqmb-A,5,"Authentic Indian food! Wonderful taste, fast delivery even though we were staying further than the delivery zone. Sunny bhai was very humble and provided the taste we wanted. If you are in Madrid and want to taste Indian food, go ahead and order please. Please mention at the time of ordering if you want food to be spicy."

ChIJfRaqCMonQg0RfrB2ptqmb-A,1,Service was delayed one hour because of online orders. There was only one person working in the kitchen and counter. And he did not see us sitting in his restaurant. I don't know how! Was not happy with their behaviour.
ChIJocO7xbMnQg0Raw0M-jNvsGs,5,"Tiny and cozy place.
Owners treated me like family (I'm very chatty).
Best stir fried tagliatelle ever üòã!
And don't forget to add it a little spice üëå."
ChIJocO7xbMnQg0Raw0M-jNvsGs,5,I highly recommend this place. The service was very kind! Food was good :)
ChIJocO7xbMnQg0Raw0M-jNvsGs,5,"We discovered this place yesterday, Monday 10/28/2024, without a doubt a great discovery, exquisite food, prepared instantly and very tasty.  Starch noodles, delicious, finger-licking hot beef and super delicious Chinese eggplant, we had black sesame balls for dessert that were delicious and two Tsingtao beers. Total 32 euros. To repeat."
ChIJocO7xbMnQg0Raw0M-jNvsGs,4,"In short, a good experience. Even though the entire menu was in Chinese, the restaurant staff was very friendly and attentive, which made my visit even more pleasant. Additionally, the food was extremely fresh and tasty, which left a very positive impression on me. It is not an expensive place either. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality, authentic meal."
ChIJocO7xbMnQg0Raw0M-jNvsGs,5,Neighborhood bar converted into a Chinese restaurant. I had a soup and it was delicious and at a very affordable price. They don't speak much Spanish but they do have the menu translated and it's easy to order. I will repeat to try more things.
ChIJXZL8x7QnQg0RTx0VTiMWQbE,2,Got food poisoning sickness a few hours after eating durum here. The low quality of the food is the reason for the low prices
ChIJXZL8x7QnQg0RTx0VTiMWQbE,5,"We love d√∂ner. This place will give you d√∂ner, fries, and a coke for 5.50. Can you beat that? I say no. They bring 2 sauces to the table. Their version of ranch and ketchup. You‚Äôll notice that they‚Äôre similar to those condiments, but better. The food was hot. We were served within minutes. I personally prefer a more spicy d√∂ner kebap, but for most people who enjoy d√∂ner, this will be hard to beat. Conveniently located near the metro. You can get a whole chicken here for around 6 euro. Cooked quite nicely too. We have no complaints on this one."
ChIJXZL8x7QnQg0RTx0VTiMWQbE,5,Fun Pakistani restaurant on the edge of Madrid's Chinatown. Good food and inexpensive.  Large outdoor area under parasol. Friendly service. Nice meal with beer 9 Euros.  The Usera Metro stop is a dozen steps away.
ChIJXZL8x7QnQg0RTx0VTiMWQbE,5,Delicious food in Madrid and halal! Love it
ChIJXZL8x7QnQg0RTx0VTiMWQbE,5,High quality of meat a must eat place
ChIJ85YNQbMnQg0RcC-lWAFqfUU,3,"Ordered Patas Bravas as a Tapas & was served a massive plateful. Admittedly very nice but t would have been enough for a Tapas for at least four people. Similarly ordered Calamari (not as a Tapas) & received a massive plateful, enough for at least 2 people with accompaniments. This place does nice food but is certainly not a Tapas Restaurant as I, and I think most people, understand the term Tapas."
ChIJ85YNQbMnQg0RcC-lWAFqfUU,5,Nice Spanish taverna. Fresh and quality food. We love it
ChIJ85YNQbMnQg0RcC-lWAFqfUU,5,Staff is kind and welcoming. Food is fresh and delicious.
ChIJ85YNQbMnQg0RcC-lWAFqfUU,5,Fabulous flamenco on Friday note....local artists give new meaning to autentico!!!!
ChIJ85YNQbMnQg0RcC-lWAFqfUU,4,"Food: we went on a Wednesday, we ordered a menu, I liked everything, and the plates were full
Service: they have been fast and attentive
Atmosphere: the normal one for a neighborhood bar, but we left impregnated with a strong smell of food, which is why I have given a lower score on this point."
ChIJt5-H5rAnQg0RrzMO6_B8y6g,3,ok
ChIJt5-H5rAnQg0RrzMO6_B8y6g,4,I love the food
ChIJt5-H5rAnQg0RrzMO6_B8y6g,4,Nice
ChIJt5-H5rAnQg0RrzMO6_B8y6g,5,Full
ChIJt5-H5rAnQg0RrzMO6_B8y6g,2,The rather neglected place did not have the heating on (even the staff was in jackets) well prepared silpancho the rest of the dishes ‚Ç¨12 and well the spicy one came with 2 pieces of tongue and half a breast with half the plate of salad...
ChIJL5kRTLUnQg0RGPPeDF1t7ZM,5,"Didn't eat anything, but what I saw looked good. What was cool is that it's so old school. Proper waiters, when they bring you a cafe con leche, they bring the coffee and add the hot or cold milk at the table. Same with vermouth or wine, all at the table. When you're done it's a short walk down to the river walk which is also a nice way to pass the time"
ChIJL5kRTLUnQg0RGPPeDF1t7ZM,1,Food was cold even the 27‚Ç¨ pluma ib√©rico. Table was never cleaned had to share forks with my wife. And the service was non existent. Won‚Äôt be coming back and I live around the corner
ChIJL5kRTLUnQg0RGPPeDF1t7ZM,5,Very nice restaurant with tasty food at affordable prices. The waiters are very nice and the ambiance great. Will come back again for sure
ChIJL5kRTLUnQg0RGPPeDF1t7ZM,5,"The food was absolutely delicious, the service was great, the space very comfortable and joyful. I went by myself following recommendation from a friend and was no disappointed. I was very embarassed since my bank cards stopped working due to a technical problem from my bank once it was time to pay the bill and I did not have enough cash, but the staff was very kind, patient and understanding, and told me not to worry about it (I apologized and returned later to pay the remainder). 10/10 would recommend and will definitely go back."
ChIJL5kRTLUnQg0RGPPeDF1t7ZM,5,Fantastic place for local food and tapas. The meat is highly recommended.
ChIJdbShJ7MnQg0RJmtFBQoqNkI,5,"From what I see there won't be many things to choose from but they are all good, you could try it sometime and you'll surely like it :3. Greeting"
ChIJdbShJ7MnQg0RJmtFBQoqNkI,5,A great place for authentic Chinese ramen
ChIJdbShJ7MnQg0RJmtFBQoqNkI,5,Rich and tasty. Everything very good.
ChIJdbShJ7MnQg0RJmtFBQoqNkI,5,Everything is delicious.
ChIJdbShJ7MnQg0RJmtFBQoqNkI,5,Very abundant and very good food
ChIJ0SNmEbInQg0RxHogneqmeQ8,2,Ok
ChIJ0SNmEbInQg0RxHogneqmeQ8,5,"There is an atmosphere, good food, service, everything is wonderful... I will miss it! the empanadas deserve a star"
ChIJ0SNmEbInQg0RxHogneqmeQ8,5,"Bar that is very full of people, taking into account that there was the Chinese New Year celebration, and there was only one waitress serving the dozens of people who almost entered suddenly. Chapeau!!!
The portions are very large and only ‚Ç¨2 for almost an entire tortilla sandwich (it was my portion)."
ChIJ0SNmEbInQg0RxHogneqmeQ8,5,"Nice bar, very friendly waitress, they ask you what you want for an aperitif. Totally recommended"
ChIJ0SNmEbInQg0RxHogneqmeQ8,5,"Kindness and quality, I loved the coffee the girl prepared, I recommend it and would return.üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª"
ChIJTeGPCEwmQg0RuBakuGLtVqs,2,"Terrible service, super slow and you need to beg for them to bring you food. The quality of the meat is not good, you can see it and you can taste it, they try to fill you with sausages overcoocked rice, beans and frozen fries. This is a shame for any Brazilian. Avoid this restaurant. Also their 2x1 deal is a bit shady"
ChIJTeGPCEwmQg0RuBakuGLtVqs,4,"The waitresses were quite dismissive and not the friendliest‚Ä¶but the guys bringing the meat round were lovely, especially, Cristian! He was the best! The food was delicious and it was a very good value for money! Beautiful views of Madrid if you get a table outside ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJTeGPCEwmQg0RuBakuGLtVqs,2,"If it wasn't for the food and the other workers, I would give it a 1 star.

The food was excellent. I also appreciate the kindness of the guys cutting the meat. But the 2 waitresses were rude! I asked for a spoon and the waitress (I think she's the manager because she was wearing a different uniform) took the spoon and gave us the spoon holding the bowl part (cabeza de la cuchara).

I am a regular customer at Brasayle√±a but this was the worst experience!

Kudos to the chef and the other waiter for good service!"
ChIJTeGPCEwmQg0RuBakuGLtVqs,3,"Our waitress needing more training. Food was not good. I asked for vegetarian pasta, and that was problematic. It was terrible. Salad was great."
ChIJTeGPCEwmQg0RuBakuGLtVqs,1,"terrible restaurant, extremely dirty, no attitude from the waiters, they don't speak english, nervous atmosphere, the kitchen is full of rubbish and dirt"
ChIJdxaw3EomQg0R9K2GTCMNy74,5,"They have mouthwatering pizzas. One of the best sliced pizzas i have had in a long time. So many options, vegetarian as well. We just loved it so much, especially the mushroom and 4 cheese one. You can get a size of pizza according to your need, large or small. Will recommend this place if you are in the neighbourhood."
ChIJdxaw3EomQg0R9K2GTCMNy74,5,"If you're feeling for a bit of a pizza fix I recommend stopping by Alice for a slice/portion they have a wide variety of selections. I happened to get there as soon as my favorite pizza margarita came out the oven!

Additionally if you stop by ask for Daniella she is awesome and was very patient as we decided what we wanted"
ChIJdxaw3EomQg0R9K2GTCMNy74,5,Awesome pizza would have more but just eat 4. Will come back for sure!
ChIJdxaw3EomQg0R9K2GTCMNy74,4,It's good but not great; friendly staff; quick service.
ChIJdxaw3EomQg0R9K2GTCMNy74,5,"Good, crispy pizza slices. üçï üëçüëç"
ChIJd1-kj0omQg0R_0CdjfjaAyU,5,"Visited Wanderlust last night and had a couple drinks and tapas! Dana our server was awesome and made the entire experience spectacular. She was extremely enthusiastic and had an infectious personality.

The Tapas were also great, so much so I ate them and forgot to take a picture!

We had Mahou Radlers which were great also. I definitely recommend visiting."
ChIJd1-kj0omQg0R_0CdjfjaAyU,2,"Location really nice.
Service one person friendly, the other not friendly.
Food: We had Tomato Salad with Tuna. Tomatos were old and soft, salad would need some more olive oil or vinegear, tuna was good.
Price on the menu and online was 12.99, but on the invoice it was 13.99.
Not really good experience."
ChIJd1-kj0omQg0R_0CdjfjaAyU,2,The food was great but service was definitely NOT! The server took our order and we waited for 40 mins for nothing. Only to find out that there was a confusion from her end because she was thinking that what we ordered was not final!
ChIJd1-kj0omQg0R_0CdjfjaAyU,2,"Ordered tarta aguacate, croquetas and calamares. All dishes are around 12‚Ç¨.
No seasoning at all with the aguacate and calamares had no taste and were rubbery.  Had to ask for salt. Service and space is great..but unfortunately I think it's terrible value for what we received."
ChIJd1-kj0omQg0R_0CdjfjaAyU,5,"This restaurant was such a pleasure to visit. We just sat down to rest our legs and to have a glass of...something. Ordered two glasses of white to some calamares and a roll.
We were served two options of wine
(by the keeper?) who described with passion and pride the districts, characters etc.
The meal was just what we were aiming for and we had also a glass of red.
The same procedure; two options, testing, passionate description.
And the best: he had to leave and left the whole bottle ""on the house"".
This restaurant made our day üíï"
ChIJrYFr3EomQg0Rq15GfqQawBk,2,"Certainly does not have the buzz of a normal Dunkin Donuts. Staff are not engaged and lacking basic courtesy. Flavored drinks tastes are off more like bubblegum than the white chocolates and vanilla they are meant to be like. Compared to the bustling mall it's in, the place is empty... It seems like the locals have already cast their vote about the place."
ChIJrYFr3EomQg0Rq15GfqQawBk,1,They changed their policy and no longer allow dogs inside and the soy milk they use tastes awful. I couldn't finish my coffee because of the flavor.
ChIJrYFr3EomQg0Rq15GfqQawBk,5,"The donuts were nice, they had various types and special donuts. The service was excellent and they were nice when explaining the donuts that I didn't know about."
ChIJrYFr3EomQg0Rq15GfqQawBk,3,Expensive and the staff is quite rude.
ChIJrYFr3EomQg0Rq15GfqQawBk,5,"Yummy donuts I love dunkin donuts so delicious, thank you!"
ChIJsVUs20omQg0Rzu5NTt1l2fg,2,"Had to eat something quick and this place looked so good. But I don't know. It was a little bit sad. We ordered a menu of a warm sandwich, 2 cold sandwiches and a drink. The cold sandwiches were ok. Jamon Serrano was blend. The chicken was...eh Ok-

If you're ordering, go for warm sandwiches. The ham and cheese was the best one, but I could make this at home for less than 5‚Ç¨"
ChIJsVUs20omQg0Rzu5NTt1l2fg,5,"One of the best Rodillla of Madrid! For sure! I tried different Rodilla en Madrid but in this rodilla, we have the best customer experience. A big thank you to the Team who is working there, keep going! üëå‚ú®‚ú®"
ChIJsVUs20omQg0Rzu5NTt1l2fg,4,"Came here for an afternoon coffee, and there was a bundle of ‚Ç¨2.50 latte & pudding"
ChIJsVUs20omQg0Rzu5NTt1l2fg,4,"We tried this during Spain trip
..a decent outlet to try cofee and sandwiches"
ChIJsVUs20omQg0Rzu5NTt1l2fg,3,Fast ready made sandwiches and coffee shop
ChIJf-ne6UomQg0R9Yj6iwwi40A,5,Genial!
ChIJf-ne6UomQg0R9Yj6iwwi40A,5,Super
ChIJf-ne6UomQg0R9Yj6iwwi40A,5,Expectacular
ChIJf-ne6UomQg0R9Yj6iwwi40A,5,Super yummy
ChIJf-ne6UomQg0R9Yj6iwwi40A,4,Ok
ChIJ7SCEQrQnQg0RoWGYUKK7fcs,5,"Five Guys never disappoints, whether it's the USA or Madrid. Generous portion of French Fries, with Heinz ketchup available. A true taste of an American classic."
ChIJ7SCEQrQnQg0RoWGYUKK7fcs,5,"Best burger in Madrid and probably the world. It's up to the level of Gasoline grill cheeseburger from Copenhagen. Any combination is excellent but I recommend ""bacon cheeseburger"" with pickles, relish and dressings like mayo/ketchup. Awesome method free refills for drinks and the restaurant has an amazing view of madrid from the terrace of the shopping. Opens til 12 am"
ChIJ7SCEQrQnQg0RoWGYUKK7fcs,1,"I‚Äôve ordered from here many times and I‚Äôm a huge fan of this place back in the states. However, every time I order food here on the Uber eats app something is always missing. On top of that this location is super slow in person. I one time waited a whole hour just for ONE milkshake. I hate giving one star review but this location needs to step up their game."
ChIJ7SCEQrQnQg0RoWGYUKK7fcs,5,"Never had better burger/ fries in fast food. I can just recommend and next time I'll be in Madrid, I have to go again"
ChIJ7SCEQrQnQg0RoWGYUKK7fcs,3,"During the first few months of opening it always had a very full line. It has been a great months and I decided to go try it during lunch on a Thursday. There was zero wait. The service was quick, helpful and nice. I've been to a few five guys in the states. It had a slightly different feel but the same idea. But the biggest noticeable difference was the taste and flavor of the burger and fries. It just wasn't up to what I have eaten on many occasions."
ChIJmyeaf0smQg0Rgx2EcPZ6aP8,5,"Bien,very good,i like it"
ChIJmyeaf0smQg0Rgx2EcPZ6aP8,4,"Good chicken grill in the Usa area, very close to the Madrid R√≠o area and Matadero. The chicken was very good. We will return to try some of their other dishes."
ChIJmyeaf0smQg0Rgx2EcPZ6aP8,1,"What a robbery today!! half a cold chicken ‚Ç¨4, when the problem is them not having enough chickens to sell. Besides, they make you pay almost for the entire chicken and when I ask him to pay by card he tells me that it is a minimum of ‚Ç¨6. Fatal is not that they make you pay whatever you want even if you don't have more chicken, but that you also have to consume something to complete the minimum and they offer me a canned Coca Cola for no less than ‚Ç¨2 for a canned Coca Cola? Total shame, I always buy but this time I think the treatment was not the most appropriate. I hope with that attention everything goes well for you. I won't come back again. Luck"
ChIJmyeaf0smQg0Rgx2EcPZ6aP8,1,It's the second time we're ordering roast chicken to go. In both cases they had sold our order even though we had reserved it in person. They have flatly refused to acknowledge having booked and have refused to provide me with the complaint form. All staff were without masks. It makes me think that this place is illegal. I ask anyone who has the possibility to send someone to do an inspection.
ChIJmyeaf0smQg0Rgx2EcPZ6aP8,1,"Honestly, I DO NOT recommend this place at all... I'm going to put the photo of the salad they served me. Some poorly placed lettuce and one...yes yes ONE slice of tomato...a piece of rubbish, the one that was serving me and cooking without marking...My hair has stood on end...Unhygienic place."
ChIJi05OvMgnQg0R7dekhJ3G_to,4,Good for quick dinner with a reasonable price üôÇ
ChIJi05OvMgnQg0R7dekhJ3G_to,2,This is shourma place
ChIJi05OvMgnQg0R7dekhJ3G_to,3,Regular
ChIJi05OvMgnQg0R7dekhJ3G_to,5,"They have super cheap and delicious spicy chicken! And the durum too, great!!"
ChIJi05OvMgnQg0R7dekhJ3G_to,1,"It is a very very dirty place, the food is terrible. There is a strong smell and grease in several places. It's disgusting.... They should close places like this because they are unhealthy."
ChIJ--Xjo84nQg0RYmFd0I26pMs,1,The Mango daiquiri was more like a huge ice cream. Cockteils can improve a lot.
ChIJ--Xjo84nQg0RYmFd0I26pMs,5,"This is a great spot, you can chill and have a glass of wine and watch people walk. The food is good and the terraza has a full bar. Dogs are welcome. Service is fast and courteous. I highly recommend it."
ChIJ--Xjo84nQg0RYmFd0I26pMs,5,"It‚Äôs like a garden coffee break time
You can stop by after doing some sports or watch the kids playing
It has all kind of soft drinks and good options for a quick snack"
ChIJ--Xjo84nQg0RYmFd0I26pMs,5,"Very nice ""beach"" bar next to the Madrid Rio Park"
ChIJ--Xjo84nQg0RYmFd0I26pMs,5,Really good cocktails
ChIJn785XK0nQg0RauCNyUW4MiQ,5,"Honestly, words fall short to describe this place. The waiters are great, super attentive and the service is unbeatable, all the food is 10 but with that cook... ‚ò∫Ô∏è I think that 10 falls short for anything in this place. Another very important thing, super careful with the issue of allergies ü•π They have also participated in one of the most beautiful and special days of my life, my wedding. Guys THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING"
ChIJn785XK0nQg0RauCNyUW4MiQ,5,"When my brother and sister-in-law told us that on their wedding day they were inviting us all to eat at this bar, I knew that the quality was going to be very good because I had already been with them for a day, but very good is an understatement. All the food, appetizers, sausages, my goodness, how are the gildas!, the revolconas potatoes with torreznos, the meat... top quality! We cheer the cook for the love she puts into each dish. Spectacular service!!! I have to go back because I feel terrible for not having even asked the waiter who served us what his name was and he spent every minute making sure we didn't miss anything without being noticed... In short, it's a gift to find a place like this and I plan to go back many times!!! THANK YOU!!!"
ChIJn785XK0nQg0RauCNyUW4MiQ,5,"A year ago they changed owners and the truth is that now it is much better than with the former waiter who ran it. Good customer service and good prices. The place is not suitable for people in wheelchairs, since you have to climb a step and the toilets are in the basement."
ChIJn785XK0nQg0RauCNyUW4MiQ,5,"We have celebrated a very important day and both the food and the service have been spectacular! Thank you! Incredible meat, rice, revolconas potatoes, bravas, starters... All delicious and super nice waiters and cook!"
ChIJn785XK0nQg0RauCNyUW4MiQ,5,The food is incredible and the service impeccable. We had a wedding at the bar and everything turned out perfect. Unbeatable!
ChIJrXgZUs8nQg0Re_c86cX2XJQ,5,"Fabulous, a very nice beautiful place just beside Madrid Rio ! one of very few places with a very nice playlist of international rock and roll (Queen, U2, Scorpion, The Police, Beatles ...)  No Spanish Rock ü§©üòçüçª"
ChIJrXgZUs8nQg0Re_c86cX2XJQ,1,"Only half of the products we requested from the menu were available. From the two Loleas we ordered, only one was served, even though we asked for the second one multiple times. We waited an eternity for our drinks and snacks and even waited 20 minutes to pay the bill after we requested it twice times."
ChIJrXgZUs8nQg0Re_c86cX2XJQ,4,"The server was very lovely, helpful and kind, easily switched to English to help my friend and I.
The coffee was good, we did not get food.
The place and view is lovely."
ChIJrXgZUs8nQg0Re_c86cX2XJQ,5,"Great place to stop by if you are near. Good coffe. Even in the highest temperatures you can enjoy some wind and shadow.
In the evening expect a lot of people as they go out as temperature falls down. There is a menu in the evening as well so you can enjoy some food and drinks with your friends/family."
ChIJrXgZUs8nQg0Re_c86cX2XJQ,5,Nice place to cooldown after walking Rio Madrid
ChIJTZDfl0wmQg0RA3VmpUiJOCo,4,"One of the staff was rude to me. Thank goodness we don't come here for the niceties. Or the silence, for that matter. Either way, we'll keep coming. I just wish the management would stop being greedy and pay these guys proper salaries so the staff would cheer up a bit and not be rude."
ChIJTZDfl0wmQg0RA3VmpUiJOCo,4,"Staffs are very polite. They give you time, the food are usual KFC. Very well located in Usera."
ChIJTZDfl0wmQg0RA3VmpUiJOCo,5,"‚Ñ≠ùî¨ùî™ùî¶ ùîûùî©ùî©ùî¶, ùî±ùî¨ùî°ùî¨ ùîüùî≤ùî¢ùî´ùî¨, ùî™ùî¢ ùîûùî±ùî¢ùî´ùî°ùî¶ùî¨ ùî™ùîûùîØùî¶ùîûùî´ùîû."
ChIJTZDfl0wmQg0RA3VmpUiJOCo,1,An absolutely horrible cashier. The receipt said her name was Mireya. She got irritated when I didn't have anything smaller than a ‚Ç¨50 note. She then got orders mixed up and got argumentative when I told her she charged me for the wrong order. She got irritated with her manager when she arrived and talked disrespectfully about her colleagues when other guests asked why they were waiting so long for their food. Just a horrible person who really shouldn't be in a job serving the public.
ChIJTZDfl0wmQg0RA3VmpUiJOCo,3,Chicken pieces were very dry. They must have been sitting for a long time. Not pleasant at all
ChIJ96_FHUwmQg0RuinENsowBCU,5,"In this place, you can eat outside or inside. It has a lot of dishes and desserts to choose. Workers are very kind, they do very good their job."
ChIJ96_FHUwmQg0RuinENsowBCU,5,"Great Ham and overall food was really good.
Good place for a quick bite or full dish."
ChIJ96_FHUwmQg0RuinENsowBCU,5,Centric. Good place to taste the best Spanish ham and other plates.
ChIJ96_FHUwmQg0RuinENsowBCU,4,a must place and a place you will like to have a quick snack and a drink.
ChIJ96_FHUwmQg0RuinENsowBCU,5,Pretty good food for reasonable price :)
ChIJB_M0CbMnQg0RTxom3LKH-cc,4,great food and nice place. I love how they serve the food. Servings per plate is good for two. A little bit pricey compare to the other Restaurants but price is reasonable...
ChIJB_M0CbMnQg0RTxom3LKH-cc,5,"The food here was amazing! We were looking for somewhere inexpensive to eat, and whilst it wasn‚Äôt super cheap, the food was delicious and well worth it! I highly recommend the fish- it was the best fish I have ever had! The meal for 5 of us with drinks plus a bottle of Cava was less that ‚Ç¨100, which given the quality of the meal, was well worth it! Would highly recommend!"
ChIJB_M0CbMnQg0RTxom3LKH-cc,5,"This restaurant has atmosphere and a lot of Colombia artifacts. But the wine is very good by the bottle and the food is unbelievably good. We had the meat platter and the steak and it was huge. It came with big platters (not plates) of rice, beans, sauce and potatoes, yucca and various kinds of meat. When you come here, be sure you are hungry.  Good value for the prices as well. The four of us ate like kings with wine for under $100 Euros. This restaurant is the best so far in Madrid and we have been eating out for four days."
ChIJB_M0CbMnQg0RTxom3LKH-cc,4,"Good an inexpensive food, portions are huge so plan accordingly.
I'm not an expert on Colombian food so I can't vouch for authenticity, but it was tasty and plentiful. There's a lot of South American patrons so it must be good.
If I could change anything it'd be the beer selection."
ChIJB_M0CbMnQg0RTxom3LKH-cc,4,"Food is good, service is not the best."
ChIJ4c_JCksmQg0R_JjLypEZm9s,5,"Best Chinese food I have tried in Madrid ever!! With such a amazing food and the decent price, I have to say you couldn‚Äôt find another restaurant that can compare with Da Fa. These two dished are my favorite ( beef with mushroom & curry chicken)üòçüòçüòç"
ChIJ4c_JCksmQg0R_JjLypEZm9s,1,Woman ignored me while I was waiting. Eventually I sat down. No friendliness. Served starter then noodles...i waited 10mins for the chicken dish to have with the noodles. The house red wine was absolutely disgusting and not healthy for human consumption.
ChIJ4c_JCksmQg0R_JjLypEZm9s,3,"I ordered their special fried rice, I didn't like it, but the duck pineapple was amazing."
ChIJ4c_JCksmQg0R_JjLypEZm9s,5,"This is the best Chinese food in all of Madrid.  It is very authentic and full of flavor. If you go there be sure to try the duck, it is amazing."
ChIJ4c_JCksmQg0R_JjLypEZm9s,5,Like because tu e pula
ChIJmWtPh0wmQg0RpSUiVYf-k3Q,5,"Probably the best pulpo of my life!
For sure the best I had in Madrid!
Juicy, tender, with a splash of olive oil and some paprika spices!
Something truly special and delicious
Definitely worth a visit"
ChIJmWtPh0wmQg0RpSUiVYf-k3Q,2,"Mediocre por no decir malo. Servicio pesimo, pero amable. Pulpo muy regular, poco y caro. Habria ido mejor a un restaurante de lujo por el mismo precio. Volver? Antes me corto la mano.

It is worse inside than outside. Dont understand how anybody could go back. While not horrible, very mediocre food and small portions. Might as well go to a REAL restaurant, even a luxury one for about the same price or a tiny bit more. Return? I'd rather cut off my hand."
ChIJmWtPh0wmQg0RpSUiVYf-k3Q,5,Best pulpo in Madrid. Excellent food and great service. The home wine is superb.
ChIJmWtPh0wmQg0RpSUiVYf-k3Q,5,"One of the best place to eat galician style octopus in Madrid. Book a table in advance. Some of the food is a bit expensive, but overall great experience."
ChIJmWtPh0wmQg0RpSUiVYf-k3Q,5,The waiter was beyond wonderful! He's very informative and mindful of which foods I could consume -- no pork. Enjoyed every food we ordered SO MUCH!
ChIJRZdFwEwmQg0RWKFcKFg4C0g,5,"Nice place at the heart of an exotic neighbourhood. Classy yet accessible. Delicious author cuisine. Anything you try, you will enjoy. Great variety of delicious beer. Great service and nice friendly and inviting ambience."

ChIJRZdFwEwmQg0RWKFcKFg4C0g,3,I love the white wine Caraballa
ChIJRZdFwEwmQg0RWKFcKFg4C0g,1,Cold food. Poor flavouring.

ChIJM7Xhv8gnQg0RBYtOSHsq38M,5,The service is fast and the workers are friendly.
ChIJM7Xhv8gnQg0RBYtOSHsq38M,1,"It's been a rough 24 hours dealing with the food poisoning I got from this place.
Toilets were disgusting and so was the eating area. Was covered in flies while trying to eat."
ChIJM7Xhv8gnQg0RBYtOSHsq38M,1,"I went to this Burger King and was looking forward the REBEL Whopper.
This was the worst food I ever ate at a BK.
The potatoes were cold and old. But the burger (I ate it before and was enthusiastic about it) was burnt and dry - like a peace of coal. But despite that the burger was cold. I mean: cold! The extra cheese was still cold as directly from the fridge. The paddies were cold as ice.
Since I had the burger for take away I couldn‚Äôt complain it.  But I am so upset and disappointed that I will send an E-Mail to the central office in US.
Disgusting."
ChIJM7Xhv8gnQg0RBYtOSHsq38M,1,It‚Äôs a really bad place to eat the service the manager and the employees are rude and don‚Äôt know about customer service at all I was eating today when I received a phone call I had to stand up to take the call when I came back to the table a person was sitting and put my food in their bag and jacket and left I went to the manager told him what happened and his words were why did you stand up 2 times I got so mad and left the place !! Don‚Äôt go there !!!!!!!!!
ChIJCzhSM7UnQg0RA8YZpl4JdKY,4,M√±ami tapas for free for each beverage and if you're still hungry you can order more
ChIJCzhSM7UnQg0RA8YZpl4JdKY,5,"A hidden gem in an amazing city. One of the best places in Madrid to eat amazing local food at an even better price/quality. Esp considering everything is prepared daily with fresh products by the owner Sonso. Definitely need to visit if you are around.

PS: I believe that on Mondays they have lentils as part of the plato del dia - those are just beyond amazing!"
ChIJCzhSM7UnQg0RA8YZpl4JdKY,5,Excellent food and good service. I live nearby and go for a meal quite often.
ChIJCzhSM7UnQg0RA8YZpl4JdKY,5,Amazing local restaurant with delicious food and service.
ChIJCzhSM7UnQg0RA8YZpl4JdKY,5,If youre around you have to step in!! The owner Sonso is just amazing nice and warm person
ChIJG4JT57MnQg0R3o9ErHjMWpc,5,"Not your typical Andaluz place, and better for it. High quality, interesting tostas and raciones, good wine and liquor and of course- Cruzcampo. The main guy is charismatic and passionate, and the place gets packed quickly. Reserve beforehand and enjoy."
ChIJG4JT57MnQg0R3o9ErHjMWpc,5,"Best tapas place in the neighborhood. Traditional yet innovative dishes, great wine selection, and a staff that makes you feel like family."

ChIJiy7rHbEnQg0RdL63hfB8NSQ,5,"The chicken was very good, really juicy and the prices were very reasonable."
ChIJiy7rHbEnQg0RdL63hfB8NSQ,1,Expensive and unpalatable
ChIJiy7rHbEnQg0RdL63hfB8NSQ,5,Great food!  The chicken melts in your mouth!!!
ChIJiy7rHbEnQg0RdL63hfB8NSQ,5,Best barbecued chicken you'll find in Madrid!
ChIJiy7rHbEnQg0RdL63hfB8NSQ,4,I recommended for couples.
ChIJD0G9FMMnQg0R2rFhK9bBbKU,5,We had an absolutely amazing meal. We shared a selection of dishes between four of us. They were all delicious and we honestly couldn't decide which was our favourite. Each one was a star in its own right.The desserts were incredible. The natural wine was a perfect accompaniment. Truly memorable and unique.
ChIJD0G9FMMnQg0R2rFhK9bBbKU,5,"Essential!!! Wonderful experience, one of the best dinners we have had lately in Madrid. Everything was perfect: the place is cozy, with a pleasant and casual atmosphere; The staff was a 10, we had the opportunity to talk with them for a long time about cooking (with the owner specifically) and it was a good complement to our dinner; And regarding the food, everything is impeccable, intense flavors and good products that make each ‚Äútapa‚Äù a bite that you cannot miss. I also note that we had a white wine that we loved (so much so that we ordered another bottle). Unbeatable value for money. Congratulations! Want to come back now!"
ChIJD0G9FMMnQg0R2rFhK9bBbKU,5,"What a discovery. A beautiful place that highlights the old architecture of the old premises, with a minimum of intervention to turn it into a very pleasant and cozy place. The team is very cordial and attentive, good treatment that is appreciated.

The value proposition and central axis of its kitchen is a Japanese charcoal grill, the robota. This flavor is noticeable in all their dishes, and it is something very different.

Order we order for two:

- 2 Charcoal buds (I loved 500 out of 100).
- Finger suckers: the eggplant one and the pork one (I would eat 5 at a time).
- 1 seasonal roasted fish (very good and spicy).
- 2 Zamburi√±a
- 1 Raviolo
- Off the menu was an eel brioche with persimmon (a delight), although for my taste the brioche was cut too thick, so I think it took away a little from the flavor of the eel, and the sweetness of the persimmon that did not stand out due to the butter in the brioche. But I insist, it was delicious anyway.
- 1 Flan with celery (fresh and sweet, delicious).

I will repeat, recommend and return."
ChIJD0G9FMMnQg0R2rFhK9bBbKU,5,"Pros:

- surprising dishes, very elaborate and delicious. We wouldn't know which one to choose, but we make a special mention of the roasted red peppers with white miso.
- super nice staff who know how to advise you.
- They are ideal tapas to eat individually or share with another person.
- delicious wines.
- Usera is a booming neighborhood with a lot of potential where, in addition to oriental food, there are surprising western places like Nato.
- open from Wednesday to Sunday.
- Good prices in view of the quality of the dishes (25-30‚Ç¨/pax).

Cons

- small place with few tables."
ChIJD0G9FMMnQg0R2rFhK9bBbKU,5,"I loved the place! It has a special magic and very good cuisine! The menu is great because you can order many things for a very good price and have a whole journey of flavors! Very good wines and attention, highly recommended"
ChIJqQdaUV4nQg0Rgd8mH0659dM,5,"I recently visited Doxa, and it was an amazing experience! We started with the gyozas, which were perfectly steamed, the filling was savoury and well-seasoned. The croquetas were another standout‚Äîcrispy on the outside with a creamy, flavorful inside.

The tacos were loaded with fresh ingredients and had a wonderful balance of flavours, with the spices just right. I really like the De Bob with fresh pineapple inside. The sando tofu was a delight‚Äîcrispy tofu paired with a delicious sauce and bread.

Overall, a must visit and 100% recommended."
ChIJqQdaUV4nQg0Rgd8mH0659dM,5,"A more than pleasant novelty in the area. Vegetarian food to snack on, eat with friends, enjoy a dinner. Croquettes are especially recommended. TOP service. Very nice. You can't fault it."
ChIJqQdaUV4nQg0Rgd8mH0659dM,5,"Vegan bar/restaurant with very delicious dishes, reasonable size and very good price. The establishment is pleasant although small (only 4 tables), but it also has an outdoor terrace. The treatment of the waiter and the cook were excellent. I would recommend the croquettes, the fried rice... I will return to try more dishes."
ChIJqQdaUV4nQg0Rgd8mH0659dM,5,"The food is incredible, no dish is left behind, although the ropavieja croquettes deserve a special mention. Regarding the prices, they are very affordable and they come in a good quantity in each plate.
The 2 guys who served us have been very pleasant, they have told us the history of the name of the place and they have also been very attentive with the issue of allergies.
10/10 the place, it has become one of my new favorites near the neighborhood. It is 15 minutes from the elliptical plaza."
ChIJqQdaUV4nQg0Rgd8mH0659dM,5,"The exceptional cook advises depending on tastes. Very elaborate dishes for everyone.
Excellent service and very pleasant terrace."
ChIJT7oh-bEnQg0RU_1NIJu3B5U,5,Very kind people and very good treatment.
ChIJT7oh-bEnQg0RU_1NIJu3B5U,5,"One of the best places in the area, to hang out, good treatment and good portions
To repeat!"
ChIJT7oh-bEnQg0RU_1NIJu3B5U,5,"Some appetizers but very delicious and the beer very fresh, things made with love and enthusiasm are immediately noticeable."
ChIJT7oh-bEnQg0RU_1NIJu3B5U,5,"A very good place to go for a drink, there is a good atmosphere and very nice people"
ChIJT7oh-bEnQg0RU_1NIJu3B5U,5,"Good family service, good appetizers, good waiters who are the same owners, excellent passing bar"
ChIJtVjyLbYnQg0RJybCCWRSFmE,5,Top menu del dia and vinho de ver√£o (red wine and soda). We were here 2 times and both were amazing! Highly recommended!
ChIJtVjyLbYnQg0RJybCCWRSFmE,5,"I can't say how much I loved this little cozy bar. I met there my favorite spanish singer El Kanka. It happens to be that he goes to El Muro for drinks with his friends when he is in town. So I decided to go, and guess what? he was there having a glass of wine with his friends. It was delightful! It was one of the best moments of my life. I recomend the tapas and the cold beer. If you like el Kanka you must go to El Muro."
ChIJtVjyLbYnQg0RJybCCWRSFmE,5,"Can't recommend enough this place! Great service, wonderful staff, very good food in a familiar atmosphere."
ChIJtVjyLbYnQg0RJybCCWRSFmE,5,everything was perfect.
ChIJtVjyLbYnQg0RJybCCWRSFmE,5,Great attention
ChIJ26vxkrcnQg0RzgiSAvpNqtI,4,"Friendly, cheap, tasty food, what else can you say of a bar that is not even a restaurant?"
ChIJ26vxkrcnQg0RzgiSAvpNqtI,5,Genail
ChIJ26vxkrcnQg0RzgiSAvpNqtI,3,Tipical spanish
ChIJ26vxkrcnQg0RzgiSAvpNqtI,5,"We came for a mid-morning snack, the waitress was very nice. With the two summer reds that are quite good and large, they have given us a large and very delicious Russian salad appetizer. We have ordered a half portion of ham croquettes, homemade and very good. Very good."
ChIJ26vxkrcnQg0RzgiSAvpNqtI,3,"We weren't bad, but we didn't think it was a place that offered us anything different enough to make us return. We were seated at a high table outside and ordered some beers, which were accompanied by cheese and sausage; Normal quality, yes. Correct prices, attention could be better coordinated."
ChIJ7_1bCrQnQg0RN--jJIw98sQ,5,"Very good chicken, excellent potatoes! Excellent and very friendly service"
ChIJ7_1bCrQnQg0RN--jJIw98sQ,5,Spectacular without a doubt the best chickens in Madrid!!! Ohhhh my good!!
ChIJ7_1bCrQnQg0RN--jJIw98sQ,5,"The food is very delicious. The lady is very friendly, whoever tries her food repeats."
ChIJ7_1bCrQnQg0RN--jJIw98sQ,5,The baking with chaulafan is very good. The pigeons and the mini barbecue were delicious.
ChIJ7_1bCrQnQg0RN--jJIw98sQ,5,"Ecuadorian food very good meat on a stick, Chaulaf√°n, hornado, rice with stew. üòâ"
ChIJQ6h6jZknQg0RiHF4EMoU5UQ,3,"Quiet place, good shade, Sunday sports atmosphere. The waiter served us well, but the pressure was very weak on the beer and the appetizer was worthy of the 80s, the typical empanadilla de la luck, some come with filling and others without, like padr√≥n peppers. Please update these tapas and put something richer and tastier, and don't give me this even if I come with children."
ChIJQ6h6jZknQg0RiHF4EMoU5UQ,5,"Super recommended, the food is great and these tapas are the best, the atmosphere is super calm and without a doubt the best for an afternoon on the terrace with friends. The treatment is professional but close, fast and with good prices!"
ChIJQ6h6jZknQg0RiHF4EMoU5UQ,5,"We came on October 18 for the ""Usera and Madrid R√≠o come and experience it"" promotion, the best tapa I had in the afternoon. Quiet, sunny terrace and friendly staff. We will repeat"
ChIJQ6h6jZknQg0RiHF4EMoU5UQ,5,Excellent menu and good service at a very reasonable price
ChIJQ6h6jZknQg0RiHF4EMoU5UQ,4,"Very calm atmosphere, very good service, especially from a very professional waiter. Everything is very good, menus, tapas, sandwiches, etc."
ChIJZ1w8RLEnQg0Rp_b57fL5_PI,1,"I don't even know where to start... It took them 15 minutes to take our order (5 dishes and 5 drinks), they brought the first course and we didn't even have the drinks or cutlery on the table, we went to get them ourselves. After 10 minutes they bring the next dish, and after a while another one... in total, between the first dish and the last two they spent just over 50 minutes waiting. Once I start eating my mixed plate I find an unpleasant surprise, I attach an image. The explanation that the cook gives us is that it is a piece of the potato peel that is very fried... I doubt that the peel forms such perfect and round rings, thank goodness I took a photo of it before showing it to you. Obviously I lost the desire to continue eating. It was the second time I went, and it will be the last. A shame of service and excuse"
ChIJZ1w8RLEnQg0Rp_b57fL5_PI,4,Very delicious homemade Bolivian food.
ChIJZ1w8RLEnQg0Rp_b57fL5_PI,1,"The food was not cooked at all good for ‚Ç¨13 I would eat better in a bar. I DO NOT RECOMMEND
the plate bigger than the food. When he said that the chicken would be chicken quarters there was nothing... terrible...literally terrible
Terrible attention because I had to be aware of everything. At no time did they help."
ChIJZ1w8RLEnQg0Rp_b57fL5_PI,5,"Good atmosphere, the flaxseed soda ‚Ç¨2 ufff quite good and the chicharron, charque and pique very delicious ü§óüòã yes I had a good time among several friends and the impeccable clean toilet service of course that also has to be taken into account."
ChIJZ1w8RLEnQg0Rp_b57fL5_PI,4,"Very good food, I really liked the waiter. Up with Euskadi!"
ChIJe6kob38nQg0R-a6KKg6euPk,5,"Wow! New Greek place in the neighborhood. The chef and service staff are very friendly. We took the suggestions of the chef spyro and got the halumi, souvlaki plate, and the moussaka. All fantastic. You can tell there is passion here & will return."
ChIJe6kob38nQg0R-a6KKg6euPk,5,"I can only say that you have to visit it, when in Madrid. Original Greek giros and nice food generally. The owners really polite and happy people. We enjoyed our time there!"
ChIJe6kob38nQg0R-a6KKg6euPk,5,Really good and authentic Greek place with delicious food (the best gyros in town for me so far) and top service. We will definitely go back and recommend too!
ChIJe6kob38nQg0R-a6KKg6euPk,5,"I highly recommend it
Prices are good and the food is really tasty

ChIJsSdairMnQg0RJ-JimUXLz-U,1,"The waitress today, Monday, had terrible service, ignoring the orders. She is on her cell phone and when she brings the food it is all burnt and I have to go back in to tell her that things are missing several times, she continues on the cell phone and decides to give me a dirty look. Terrible service, I will make sure that my acquaintances do not set foot in this place"
ChIJsSdairMnQg0RJ-JimUXLz-U,1,"Bad place to have a drink, bad service, very expensive. Disadvisable at 120 x 100"
ChIJsSdairMnQg0RJ-JimUXLz-U,1,"They are very very very annoying and noisy. They don't let you sleep.
Lousy environment.
Many drunks. It's scary.
Poor quality of their products.
Please respect and control your clients."
ChIJsSdairMnQg0RJ-JimUXLz-U,1,"Ask for the bathroom and he told me ‚Ç¨1, but excuse me? It's not like the bathroom cleans you, service seems bad from the beginning"
ChIJsSdairMnQg0RJ-JimUXLz-U,1,"Terrible place, bad attention, attention is
Terrible but from the staff"
ChIJhQXA2zcmQg0RxuAsK-pcrPE,4,"This Chinese restaurant offers a wonderful eat all you can buffet for ‚Ç¨13 Mon-Fri and ‚Ç¨15 on weekends and public holidays. The price includes dessert. The menu offers options for sushi and traditional Chinese food. The restaurant is clean, spacious and modern, although the aircon could be a bit colder during the summer months. Service is friendly and efficient."
ChIJhQXA2zcmQg0RxuAsK-pcrPE,4,"The food is good. Not great, but good. The service is efficient, the owner is very sweet, and the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated.

My favorites were the house fried rice and the dim sum. The crispy duck was also tasty.

They have several options for menu del dia, including sushi."
ChIJhQXA2zcmQg0RxuAsK-pcrPE,5,"I really like this place.
The price/quality ratio is fantastic, especially on the sushi menu's.
It's by far not the best sushi I ever had, but it's great for the price.
Waiters and the owner are always super nice.
Wouldn't go to impress a date, but always go if I feel like a quick sushi in the neighborhood."
ChIJhQXA2zcmQg0RxuAsK-pcrPE,5,"Waiter was polite, and can even speak Chinese! And Food was great!"
ChIJhQXA2zcmQg0RxuAsK-pcrPE,5,"Stumbled across this upstairs chinese restaurant by chance - Shared 3 plates between two - Fresh ingredients cooked to order - excellent sauces - good attentive staff and the owner was keen to speak English with us and tell us about her home province - With discount, prices were excellent - This is a restaurant well worth searching out."
ChIJbddJCkgmQg0RzPAPx2oodH0,5,"A great Argentinean restaurant.  dined  here alone on a Saturday night. The waiters are efficient and very pleasant, the place is bustling (also locals coming to pick up ) and the food is great. Probably the best empanada i had outside of Argentina  (and also maybe in argentina).  Will surely come back here next time i‚Äôm in Madrid"
ChIJbddJCkgmQg0RzPAPx2oodH0,5,"Delicious food, great ambiance and freshly made empanadas and desserts. They are also reasonably priced. A lovely place in a local neighborhood."
ChIJbddJCkgmQg0RzPAPx2oodH0,5,"They have English menu.
Waitress speaks English.

Food was delicious, portions are big.
Prices in general are around 12‚Ç¨ (but depending on the part of meat it can go up to like 18‚Ç¨).
Great lemonade.

The only minus (not sure if it's done intentionally or not): meat was prepared in something between rare/medium but was very good.

10/10 would recommend."
ChIJbddJCkgmQg0RzPAPx2oodH0,4,"I found the place to be a bit expensive for the food served. The service is excellent, though, and they have a number of vegetarian and vegan options marked on the menu. I tried the veggie empanadas, which were great - I'd visit again to pick some up. The wrap was a bit bland for even me, an avoidant eater, and could've used some more seasoning."
ChIJbddJCkgmQg0RzPAPx2oodH0,5,My favorite place in this area. Very nice staff and food is good level. Recommended.
ChIJq_UGEUgmQg0R6gpmZlWrDTQ,5,"Great, lesser known, restaurant for traditional Spanish food. Service is attentive and know their customers like family. Quite popular for lunch. My family has been coming to Anta for close to a decade. The tortilla de patata is specifially good!"
ChIJq_UGEUgmQg0R6gpmZlWrDTQ,5,"Best Spanish restaurant in Madrid.
Best callos con garbanzos in Spain."
ChIJq_UGEUgmQg0R6gpmZlWrDTQ,4,"Just had a snack and some jamon. Good, not spectacular. Locals come here."
ChIJq_UGEUgmQg0R6gpmZlWrDTQ,5,Great little neighborhood spot. Great tapas and service with your drinks.
ChIJq_UGEUgmQg0R6gpmZlWrDTQ,3,So far so good.  In the average.
ChIJdbN-2jcmQg0RlKxiA0mQTSo,3,"I have to change my review and rating because the place actually still exist, it is just a bit higher than Google Maps shows you on the map‚Ä¶ so Google Maps actually made a mistake on this one. The place is correct, but the prices are a bit on the high side. I had patatas bravas and croquetas de jamon together with a vermuth, it costed me 21‚Ç¨ which is a bit much but I was alone, it was definitely enough for two and the price would seem more legit. I ended up giving what I didn‚Äôt finished to someone in need so I avoided waste and felt better since now everyone has an easy life nowadays with how expensive life has become.. so please if you can help people out from time to time, I hope myself that if I get in these type of situations one day that I‚Äôll find kind hearted people who could and would help one and another out of a misery. The lady that was working there was super friendly though and very smiling ‚ò∫Ô∏è always make things more enjoyable I find. My 3star rating is mostly based on the price for the rest I haven‚Äôt really tried enough to be able to rate better than just my own experience so I would definitely recommend you to go by and give it a try"

ChIJ-eFukMwnQg0RwB7St1Fi6zE,5,"Love it!
Doesn't look like much from the outside and I went in not expecting much. Well I am glad we did.
Only has Sushi and the Dragon roll, Anguilla and pez mantequilla are fantastic!! Rest was really good as well.
Service was exceptionally friendly and fast. Prices very reasonable to almost low.  Will definitely go back here.
I have been many times back since my initial review and I still really like this place üòÅ"
ChIJ-eFukMwnQg0RwB7St1Fi6zE,5,"Great place!

We are vegans and they have A LOT of great options! Absolutely recommend it

Also the staff is super welcoming and helpful"
ChIJ-eFukMwnQg0RwB7St1Fi6zE,1,I loved this place and ordered from them often UNTIL I got food poisoning and was sick for 2 days :( I ate sushi with Anguila and I am sure that was the reason. Never again
ChIJ-eFukMwnQg0RwB7St1Fi6zE,2,"Staff were friendly but the food was not very tasty and it had very few vegetables, even though we chose the vegetable options. The chicken alternative didn‚Äôt taste good."
ChIJ9WwN4kkmQg0RQ1-g66Bqgds,5,The food was amazing really tasty had the rice and beans with chivo worth it not expensive. Also recommend taking shots of mamajuana Dominican moon shine
ChIJ9WwN4kkmQg0RQ1-g66Bqgds,5,Amazing food from the Dominican Republic!! It will definitely transport you back home if you‚Äôre originally from there and if you‚Äôre not you will be greatly pleased with the savory food options on the menu!! We have been twice and will definitely go back for more!! Too many items to choose from!! Enjoy!! üòãüòãüòã
ChIJ9WwN4kkmQg0RQ1-g66Bqgds,4,I would give it a 5 but no credit card machine. Santiago the owner/manager and his staff were great and friendly. What can I say the food is what I expected to be!!! I would highly recommend this place.
ChIJ9WwN4kkmQg0RQ1-g66Bqgds,4,Nice local bar 3 minutes from Legazpi Station. The service was good. The food decent. Good to have a beer with a friend if you in that area.
ChIJ9WwN4kkmQg0RQ1-g66Bqgds,1,"We went to have dinner here because it was recommended from alot of people. When we took a place inside, we asked the staff if they had a drinks menu, but the girl didn‚Äôt even know what they had of what to suggest, so we just asked for two presidente and they didn‚Äôt came really cold, and as a dominican you know your fria has to be very cold. We ordered chicharron and bollo de yuca as an entrance, not so long after the girl came and asked us to order our main course, because it was very busy(that we didn‚Äôt experience, it wasn‚Äôt that busy at all.) so we had a couple of questions about the menu, but she really didn‚Äôt know what they sell, or to suggest. We weren‚Äôt done with the entrance and the main course came right after the entrance. My coisin had the white rice with chicken and beans sauce, her chicken was cold, so we asked if they can warm it up. I had the mofongo with gambas but also not warm, really sad. Because i was really looking forward to experience my culture food."
ChIJae04QUgmQg0RsK27vMIS1oI,5,"The menu has a wide variety of rolls to choose from, as well as other Japanese favorites like sashimi, tempura, and udon noodles.

The staff is friendly and attentive, and they are always happy to help you choose the perfect dishes for your taste.

I highly recommend iR Sushi Bar to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable sushi meal in Madrid. Here are some of the things I love about it:
The fish is fresh and high-quality.
The rolls are made to order and are very delicious.
The menu has a wide variety of options to choose from, so there is something for everyone.
The staff is friendly and attentive.
If you are looking for a great sushi bar in Madrid, I highly recommend iR Sushi Bar. You won't be disappointed!

Important note: the place is pretty tight (3 stars for the ""Atmosphere""). So, you'd better take your order out rather than dine in."
ChIJae04QUgmQg0RsK27vMIS1oI,1,"Hello Irsushi
It is the third time that, when ordering during the week, the futomaki goes from 5-6cm wide to 4cm, from 2cm thick to 1.5cm, many are missing half of the things inside and today to top it all off, you can tell that it comes from the refrigerator.
It goes from having to take it in two bites to being a normal, half-empty sushi. Yes, at full price.
Who runs this site during the week?"
ChIJae04QUgmQg0RsK27vMIS1oI,2,"I've been ordering delivery here for years. But lately, the website DOWN. Forced to have to place the order through third-party apps from exploiters (-1 star), and without being able to receive any details regarding the quantity or price of the order (-1 star). And size has gone down (-1 star). In a few weeks we will order again (because you can have a bad day) and we will see if we delete it from the list... it has changed a lot and not for the better."
ChIJae04QUgmQg0RsK27vMIS1oI,5,"The truth is that I have ordered several times and I am delighted.
The food is very good, they are super friendly and if you pick it up they give you a discount. I have it as a reference close to home to order."
ChIJae04QUgmQg0RsK27vMIS1oI,5,"I recently discovered this home delivery restaurant and it has opened up a world of flavors for me!!! I don't know why I couldn't see it before (it's behind the subway, there are no chairs, it's to order online) I ordered a combo and wakame, and I was completely full XD"
ChIJCcV3QkgmQg0RuAYHZpJBOhQ,5,"A month is not going to passed without having a dine in at this place. I give them 5 stars because their food always amazed me. They offers a lot in their menu, you always have an options in  which kind of food you wanted to try. Not a big restaurant like other restaurants in the city center, but it will satisfy your cravings. Please give it a try, you will never fail trying their delicious food."
ChIJCcV3QkgmQg0RuAYHZpJBOhQ,5,Quaint place with nice people. Food was good. Prices right.
ChIJCcV3QkgmQg0RuAYHZpJBOhQ,4,"encebollado was the headline, hearty and tasty! definitely its a must.
the waitress was nice and friendly however I  don‚Äôt understand what was the rush to bring all the plates at once in a fast way, since they got cold.
overall it was nice to have a beautiful chunk of Ecuador again!"
ChIJCcV3QkgmQg0RuAYHZpJBOhQ,3,"Our waitress was lovely - very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, the food was not as good as in some other Ecuadorian restaurants I've been to. I ordered hornado but it seemed more like fritada as the meat was really dry and not the right texture at all for hornado. My boyfriend said his seco wasn't that good either as it was cold. The empanada verde was nice"
ChIJCcV3QkgmQg0RuAYHZpJBOhQ,5,Very yummy food. Everything we ordered was spectacular. The spicy sauce was really spicy - great kick!
ChIJXcOPKEYmQg0R3ryJj55zK6I,5,Amazing cake!!! Yes please go there! Their pastores and food are delicious and home made
ChIJXcOPKEYmQg0R3ryJj55zK6I,5,Good spot for coffee and a quick snack

The solomillo & rabo the toro were exquisite.
The scallops shells are just marvellous.
Desserts were simple but amazing.
Hats off to the chef

The wine from Madrid is just wonderful & a very good surprise.

The restaurant is elegant with an excellent service.

üëèüèª"
ChIJ_Rt_KEYmQg0Rrvl6GgY_334,5,"5 star just because they really deserve it!

This is not a small neighborhood restaurant. This is a great place that is up to the level of the best restaurants downtown Madrid but without all the fancy atmosphere and nonesense. Katz Asia offers the real deal in meats and has a great service, fast, efficient and profesional. Been here a couple of times and will come back every time and in this area of the city. We had amazing well cut ib√©rico ham, followed by seasonal grilled white asparagus and of course you can‚Äôt miss the amazing meats and how well they prepared them. Wrapped up with a cheese cake that was creamy, tasty, not too sweet and great texture and cheesy flavor. And that‚Äôs why they deserve all the stars!!
Will be back!"
ChIJ_Rt_KEYmQg0Rrvl6GgY_334,5,"very fresh seafood, ordered squid ink rice and starter cold thin fish, there are generous amount of seafood in the rice, so amazing, tastes like the sea, i am more than satisfied, love everything, the service is also amazing and speaks english, very bright and cozy place :) perfect !"
ChIJ_Rt_KEYmQg0Rrvl6GgY_334,5,"I was visiting Madrid for a couple of weeks.

My cousin made a reservation for a large group :) we had an amazing time , food was good , price reasonable :) dessert was incredible :D"
ChIJ_Rt_KEYmQg0Rrvl6GgY_334,5,"Absolutely delicious, great discovery in Madrid. Great ingredients and staff"
ChIJFw07H0gmQg0RHKYKyc9a82U,5,"The attention is excellent, the girls are very attentive. In my case, I am vegan, I get things to eat, it has an incredible variety, everything is clean, very correct, the only thing is that it is often full and you have to wait a little, everything else is fine."
ChIJFw07H0gmQg0RHKYKyc9a82U,5,"The food is very delicious
The beans with clams that they always have on Sundays are exquisite.
Very good value for money"
ChIJFw07H0gmQg0RHKYKyc9a82U,5,Delighted with your foodüòç excellent quality and very tasty! The girls who serve are very friendly and attentiveü•∞
ChIJFw07H0gmQg0RHKYKyc9a82U,5,"Very delicious, excellent food, I love the marmitako and the marinera noodles, not to mention the brussels sprouts, they are the best!"
ChIJFw07H0gmQg0RHKYKyc9a82U,5,"The sea bream is very delicious, the mushrooms with artichokes are delicious, everything is very delicious, highly recommended, Barbara, 100% recommended."
ChIJd5ke2jUmQg0RgobpMy44ekg,5,"This Italian gem is a culinary delight with the authentic taste of Italy. Writing reviews take time so I only write them when I‚Äôm Seriouslyyyy impressed! Went there twice already. The tiramisu is a slice of heaven, and the frutti di mare is so addictive, you'll find yourself resisting the urge to lick the plate clean. A true culinary masterpiece‚ÄîI'm already planning my next visit!‚Ä¶ tomorrow üò©"
ChIJd5ke2jUmQg0RgobpMy44ekg,5,"Fantastic pizza...some of the best I've had...nice neighborhood, quiet and comfortable...had a Peroni Italian beer...the staff was friendly staff...recommend."
ChIJd5ke2jUmQg0RgobpMy44ekg,4,We went for lunch and the pasta was delicious. I had carbonara and I can say it was freshly made by using the traditional recipe. The rest of the dishes of the table looked amazing as well. The staff is kind.
ChIJd5ke2jUmQg0RgobpMy44ekg,5,"Just arrived to Madrid and looked for a cool place with a great pizza nearby, and we couldn't pick any better. The pizza was outstanding, and the staff has been so welcoming and kind to us. They even have given us tips where to continue the night! Mar√≠a Alejandra, the waitress was incredible and so kind to us. 10/10 Well done üòä David & Andy"
ChIJd5ke2jUmQg0RgobpMy44ekg,4,"If you go on weekend there are slots. We were told to leave without dessert because people in the next slot for our table had arrived.
I hate that kind of policies. During the week, however, things are different. Much, much better."
ChIJ667TLk4mQg0RAnjsxRjneT4,5,Amazing service
ChIJ667TLk4mQg0RAnjsxRjneT4,3,Normal
ChIJ667TLk4mQg0RAnjsxRjneT4,5,"He llegado a este bar con unas amigas, y la atenci√≥n de Devora ha sido fant√°stica!
Aunque est√°bamos indecisos en que pedir, nos ha sabido aconsejar y todo lo que nos ha puesto ha sido un acierto. Volveremos!"
ChIJ667TLk4mQg0RAnjsxRjneT4,5,"We have known the site for a long time. He never lets us down. Every time we go they have delicious things on the menu and they are all of quality. The place, although small, is very cozy. Congratulations to Victor who always makes room for us. And Diego has excellent room control.
Excellent Oreo pie, Black Angus steak and low-temperature torrezno."
ChIJ667TLk4mQg0RAnjsxRjneT4,4,One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. Ideal both for having vermouth or a few beers and for lunch/dinner. They always give you a good appetizer along with the drink (not the typical basic olives or potatoes). The food has a very good quality-price ratio and is abundant.
ChIJ83avwTcmQg0R-Ys3Ty8c0S0,5,"I‚Äôve finally found a Pizzeria that fits my expectations in Madrid and it‚Äôs been 4 months that I can‚Äôt stop going üôèüèæ

The personal is friendly and they do their best to always be on time.

I recommend it to my English people (les fran√ßais aussi c‚Äôest ce qui se rapproche le plus de nos pizzerias)"
ChIJ83avwTcmQg0R-Ys3Ty8c0S0,5,"I've visited this Restaurant during my trip to Madrid. The pizzas were not only fast but absolutely delicious. The waitresses are incredibly kind. Overall, a wonderful experience & highly recommend it for tasty, quick pizza and friendly service!"
ChIJ83avwTcmQg0R-Ys3Ty8c0S0,2,"Pizza was dry, cold, without taste and little ingredients. The Carlos pizza in Coslada is the best pizza! I though it was going to be the same but this one is not good at all‚Ä¶ sorry  never again"
ChIJ83avwTcmQg0R-Ys3Ty8c0S0,5,My favorite place to get pizza! The staff is so friendly and the pizza always delicious. Give it a visit when your in Madrid. :)
ChIJ83avwTcmQg0R-Ys3Ty8c0S0,4,"Good value for money. ""Pizzas as you remember them"" is the slogan. Marginally better than the average takeaway pizza, thick or thin crust options."
ChIJgfyhbkYmQg0Rsj6-Nds3qbY,5,Trending Tapas has a great menu. We went for the black rice and the tuna a d both were delicious!
ChIJgfyhbkYmQg0Rsj6-Nds3qbY,5,"Lovely food, friendly staff. Took good care of us. Thank you.

The stuffed pepper cod was epic! üíï"
ChIJgfyhbkYmQg0Rsj6-Nds3qbY,1,"Careful with take away food!!! They make you pay extra, almost 15% of the food price (the more food you order, the more you 'll have to pay).
However, they don't allow you to bring your own things to avoid this cost, there's no alternative

Also last time I order to take away, they confused my order and made me pay a more expensive bill. When I went to pick up the order, they couldn't give me the money back, however, they didn't give me a drink or bread or anything to compensate the extra money paid"
ChIJgfyhbkYmQg0Rsj6-Nds3qbY,4,"Spacious bar and restaurant with attentive service. We sat in the bar area and had a few plates and a couple glasses of wine. They seem to have an extensive wine list and menu. Air conditioning was on blast on the summer day, so it was nice to cool off and enjoy a nice lunch. My only critique is that the menu is so extensive it's difficult to make a decision, or perhaps find the restaurant's true vibe. Everything tasty though!"
ChIJgfyhbkYmQg0Rsj6-Nds3qbY,3,"Nice decoration, friendly staff. Only went for drinks there, but the food didn't look so bad."
ChIJyzcjtEcmQg0R8QvEhcyhJJc,5,"The food was amazing! The steak was a little rare for me, but that is cultural norm. The wait staff was very accommodating with our group of 11. Only 2 Spanish speakers they were patient. If I come to Madrid again I will be back."
ChIJyzcjtEcmQg0R8QvEhcyhJJc,5,"The food is delicious, the service was spot on from the beginning! The atmosphere is great and when I thought it could not be better, it came the desert‚Ä¶absolutely amazing!"
ChIJyzcjtEcmQg0R8QvEhcyhJJc,4,"Good place just to drink something in the evening and watch the sunset, didn‚Äôt try anything from the menu so can‚Äôt say anything. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a little overpriced but if you want to pay for a view so it‚Äôs worthy. There are not so many waiters so they need time to bring you drinks, very friendly staff."
ChIJyzcjtEcmQg0R8QvEhcyhJJc,5,"We enjoyed their food experience a lot.
I trully recommend this place.

Tuna dishes are their MUST. Tuna is treated spectacularly well and dishes have high quality ingredients.

Please, do not miss the Camar√≥n Taco-Mex. AWESOME!

I also loved desserts: ‚ÄòVolc√°n Idiazabal‚Äô and a special torrija made by the chef (we visited the restaurant in Easter holidays and here in Spain, the ‚Äòtorrijas‚Äô are famous during that time of the year).

One thing I really want to higlight is how Cesarina (the waitress who served us) was super professional, how she recommended the best dishes and how attentive she was with us. I really miss an excelent service in most of restaurants and thanks to her all my expectations were exceeded."
ChIJyzcjtEcmQg0R8QvEhcyhJJc,5,"Trendy  new establishment which serves traditional Spanish food with a modern influence. The  food is of a very high quallity and would suit even the fussiest of diners.

The menu is in Spanish, however the staff are more than willing to interpret and to offer suggestions.

All staff, especially the manager, are very professional and helpful. There were at least 8 wait staff caring for about 50 customers.  Speedy and efficient service was provided.

A must visit establishment if you appreciated good food, quick and efficient service at quite good prices."
ChIJjYjCcUYmQg0RBLP4OsGwWe8,5,"Excellent Italian food, very friendly and professional service. The ""Pinsa"" is absolutely delicious. Their pastas are top class, equivalent to any Michelin star place. Keep up the great food quality and service! Happy to go back again!!"
ChIJjYjCcUYmQg0RBLP4OsGwWe8,5,Amazing find. Being vegetarian I was really surprised to find such amazing flavours and choices here. The food feels very fresh and high quality. We shared a tomato salad and then we ordered pasta dishes separate. Would 100% go back. We went for lunch but looks like a nice place to go in the evening too with a terrace at the front.
ChIJjYjCcUYmQg0RBLP4OsGwWe8,5,"Italian restaurant with amazing starters, fresh pasta and Roman pinsa. We loved the burrata with four types of tomatoes, some of them caramelized. The parmigiana was delicious as well. The star of the menu are the ""pinsas"", a pizza-focaccia hybrid, made with a mix of wheat, soy and rice flour. The crust is harder and crunchier than Neapolitan pizza but not quite as fluffy as focaccia. While we enjoyed the ""Nerone"", I don't think I would order it again; the ingredients didn't perfectly harmonize. With the tiramis√π, our dinner had a great ending, though."
ChIJjYjCcUYmQg0RBLP4OsGwWe8,5,"Great place!
He took the time to explain the menu in English as we were not Spanish speakers. Got great service with friendly personell.

I would definitly recommend going here!"
ChIJjYjCcUYmQg0RBLP4OsGwWe8,5,"Unique and excellent ""pinsa"" restaurant in one of the soon to be trending areas of Madrid. The dough and the ingredients are superb. Kind staff and great atmosphere. 10/10!"
ChIJ6-TK-Q0nQg0Rzj5fFjwg1ng,5,"Good place for beer and some tapas.
Cajun chicken is a must try, zesty and a little spicy. Delicious.
Chorizo was a little bit strong for my taste, but still good.
Free tapas were not as good."
ChIJ6-TK-Q0nQg0Rzj5fFjwg1ng,5,"Nice sangria and food. Gazpacho has the best taste, beef vege stew soft and flavourful and boqueron picante has the perfect balance of sour, spicy and garlicky in olive oil. Definitely recommended"
ChIJ6-TK-Q0nQg0Rzj5fFjwg1ng,5,Best Tortilla of Madrid. Good attention and very neat and clean place!
ChIJ6-TK-Q0nQg0Rzj5fFjwg1ng,5,"Love this hole in the wall bar.  It only has indoor seating.  Customers and staff were friendly.

We tried them our first night in Madrid and my two sons are now sold on tapas.  We ordered way too much food after a long day of travel (no regrets though)  The croquettas come 8 to an order.  A plate of papas bravas is comparable to a large basket of fries.  There was probably 8 good size meatballs to an order and they were fabulous with a hint of heat.  The fried bacon is outstanding.  Take your time  order a couple plates and add on as needed.

Prices are super reasonable.  Croquettas were about 9 euros a plate others we around 6."
ChIJ6-TK-Q0nQg0Rzj5fFjwg1ng,5,"You have try the wine here!!!! I was very happy being there, very near to my hotel, it looks like a popular place for locals. The food is delicious, I love the local wine, so delicious Spain wine! The owner is very friendly and nice, happy atmosphere, clean place, I made new local friends there!!! A bar which makes you lucky!"
ChIJf2zV4lEmQg0RKSIFDldKj9U,5,"Cute bright place to start your day with their delicious breakfast.

Love how they cut a hole on the toast for not breaking the egg york.
Coffee is great and a good selection of tea options as well.

We are leaving with a happy tummy and two Colette stickers. üòã"
ChIJf2zV4lEmQg0RKSIFDldKj9U,5,Its a very nice cozy bakery. The only downside is that it is a small shop so they can hold just a few tables inside. There is outdoor sitting but it is a bit cold in autumn/winter.
ChIJf2zV4lEmQg0RKSIFDldKj9U,5,"Good vegan options on the menu, very delicious. Nice place in the shadow to enjoy fresh backed bread, sweets and fresh made smoothies. Very kind service also!"
ChIJf2zV4lEmQg0RKSIFDldKj9U,5,Best bakery in the area. The bread and pastries are top notch. All the products are fresh. It is an artisan and innovative place. In love with the homemade jams and juices. Healthy and really tasty. We come back every time we visit. Great that they have coffee with soy milk as an alternative. Must visit place. Customer service is top ten
ChIJf2zV4lEmQg0RKSIFDldKj9U,5,Wonderful bakery with selected products. Sony miss it. Warm welcoming.
ChIJxziiVUYmQg0Rt0ZYXi0zwOY,3,"Went for a takeaway and ordered the barbacoa pizza, which was 7.95‚Ç¨. This was first time I tried Papa John's pizza. We had to wait for 15 min for our pizza to be ready, so I cannot complain about the service. It was correct. The pizza by itself was yummy but nothing to write home about. I have to say I prefer Domino's over this one. Overall a good experience."
ChIJxziiVUYmQg0Rt0ZYXi0zwOY,4,"Pizza is pizza and there might be people that prefers other brands, but let me tell you about Jawy... Kind, very friendly with the kids ( and it was a large group) super kind and relax when the spill a drink all over the place.
I like Papa John's,but definitely I would come back even If it wasn't my favorite,just for the service.

Gracias Jawy."
ChIJxziiVUYmQg0Rt0ZYXi0zwOY,5,I go here nearly every Friday. And nearly every Friday I am greeted by the one and only Tyrone. The pizza legend himself! I'm unsure how it is even possible for him to both be so humble and kind while still making some of the most üî• tasting pizzas that have ever graced the planet earth which are rivaled only by my moms homemade pizza when I was 10 years old. This man is a living pizza legend and also just a great man in and of himself.
ChIJxziiVUYmQg0Rt0ZYXi0zwOY,1,"We orderd two medium size pizzas through call, nd ask for total amount lady told us 30‚Ç¨ nd you have to wait 1 nd half hour  for 2 meidum size pizzas !! We go there for pick the pizza check the menu there is price of 1medium size pizza 8.97‚Ç¨..!! They charge Extra may be when people orderd for Home Delivery..!! My first Experince in (PAPA JOHNS) HORRIBLE ..!!"
ChIJxziiVUYmQg0Rt0ZYXi0zwOY,1,"NOT Recommended.. When we entered it was very hot, after a while we discovered that the air-condition is turned off!! Then we sat on a table, but it was dirty, Note that in this branch, you can have just ONE soft drink included, unlike others"
ChIJH0F7ajQmQg0RkVktw7-eMoA,5,"This place deserves all your love. Amazing value for the quality. 2 person dinner is 30‚Ç¨, comes w 5 courses, including amazing beef bulgogi Korean bbq style. Would cost over double in the USA plus food is delicious and service is great as well. Sorry, my photos don‚Äôt do it justice."
ChIJH0F7ajQmQg0RkVktw7-eMoA,4,"Homestyle Korean restaurant. Fantastic food, beautiful flavors of Korea. The restaurant filled up pretty fast and once it was full the service was really slow. Must try dishes: the Korean Chicken Wings (crispy, spicy), Bibimbap, Bulgogi. Bold, rustic, flavor explosion!! Must visit and excellent for a repeat visit. They offer kids friendly food as well. The staff are very proud of their culture and want you to enjoy their food."
ChIJH0F7ajQmQg0RkVktw7-eMoA,5,"Nice good, although I don't know how authentically Korean it is ü§îüòÅ
It is highly recommended to book in advance, mostly on Saturdays. We were two persons, arriving a Saturday by 1:25PM, and, when the girl asked if we had a reservation, I thought she was going a bit too overconfident, since the place was absolutely empty. By 2PM it was already difficult to find a seat and when we left by 2:35PM the tables were all occupied and ours were promptly used.
It was interesting and kinda funny when the man brought my plate: I like hot dishes, but I had a sore throat and didn't want it to be particularly hot, so I told him not to add any chili in it. ""It will taste to nothing"", was his response üòÇ
He was wrong: it would've been yummy even without any spicy sauce it it, since it was a bunch of delicious vegetables and rice and an egg, all served in a melting-hot pan!!
Defo recommend the place üëçüèΩ"
ChIJH0F7ajQmQg0RkVktw7-eMoA,5,"The food was delicious. I had the champong and it was amazing. The kimbap was delicious. The portion of the champong was humongous though, I would‚Äôve skipped the kimbap if I had known. Also, the staff was lovely."
ChIJH0F7ajQmQg0RkVktw7-eMoA,5,"Nice korean reataurant. Food is authentic. The ambience is standard. Quick service.
Will come back!"
ChIJk6srEDcmQg0RMXicRDZIlmA,3,Food is OK. Service is mostly good. If you go in a medium to large crowd (+6 ppl.)  it's best to call beforehand so that they'll get ready for you. However they'll always try to accommodate you.
ChIJk6srEDcmQg0RMXicRDZIlmA,2,"This place is clean. That‚Äôs the only good thing I can say.
Food is okay, but overpriced.
Service is abysmal."
ChIJk6srEDcmQg0RMXicRDZIlmA,2,good food though service can be improved by a lot
ChIJk6srEDcmQg0RMXicRDZIlmA,5,I love this place and foods here...
ChIJk6srEDcmQg0RMXicRDZIlmA,5,Good!!!
ChIJ____wDYmQg0RBS4TeqVhWvE,5,"I heard that after this restaurant changed the chef, I often come to patronize, the sauce made by this new chef is very special, what impressed me most is the ""morcilla"" snack, the sauce of this snack is made of color pepper, the taste is sweet, with the fried morcilla is very delicious. What shocked me was the dish ""chuleta"" , which was served with a cooked minced meat sauce and a freshly cooked pork chops. The last thing to say is the stewed beef tail, which is soft and tender and melts in your mouth. With the boiled sauce and butter-fragrant mashed potatoes, it is really delicious, but the most important thing is it only cost me 18 euros. When I try to make it at home, the cost of buying the materials more than 18 euros. I recommend everybody to go to have a try."
ChIJ____wDYmQg0RBS4TeqVhWvE,5,place seems under renovation right now but food and coffee is good
ChIJ____wDYmQg0RBS4TeqVhWvE,5,"Great place! The food was high quality, the waiter was very friendly and warm, yet
professional. We had a lovely Spanish breakfast here and we will definitely return because their evening menu looked great too. Also a lot of vegetarian options, which is unique in this area. Absolutely would recommend.
Muchas gracias!"
ChIJ____wDYmQg0RBS4TeqVhWvE,4,Price a bit ex but overall ok
ChIJ____wDYmQg0RBS4TeqVhWvE,3,"We have some drinks and ate dinner.
There is a bar at the front and a dinning room at the back.
TV is slightly too loud so conversations can be difficult sometimes.
Good wine selections with Madrilians wines.
Food was tasty and no greasy. The octopus  melted like butter. The Isabel potatoes are good also.
You can find locals pop in for an easy drink and something to eat."
ChIJm1rgxjYmQg0RCVohOOYKQHo,5,"One of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Madrid. The attention here is always correct and friendly and the food is very good. The portions are abundant, so don't expect to leave with an empty stomach. The price of the platters is around 4-5‚Ç¨ which is very fair. Recommended to visit if you're feeling like having some great tasty Chinese food!"
ChIJm1rgxjYmQg0RCVohOOYKQHo,5,"This Chinese restaurant has become my favourite in Madrid, the food is tasty and the lady that served our table was friendly and attentive."
ChIJm1rgxjYmQg0RCVohOOYKQHo,5,Great food and very good value for money. One of the few places with Hong Kong typical Chinese food in Madrid.
ChIJm1rgxjYmQg0RCVohOOYKQHo,5,"We had a menu del dia there (11 eur) and it was outstanding good. The personal was very friendly and attentive. The food was well done and tasty.
Totally recommend to go there!"
ChIJm1rgxjYmQg0RCVohOOYKQHo,5,It's really well done chinese food.
ChIJMZA13jUmQg0R01DtNenmmVk,4,"Costello R√≠o sits next to a busy roundabout and has seating inside and outside. We sat indoors beside a window at around 1pm.

The menu is in Spanish but it‚Äôs easy to understand basically what the food is on offer (or use Google translate). There‚Äôs a smaller menu with food and coffee/tea included.

The Ensalada Tabul√© del tio C√©sar is cous cous with shredded chicken and raisins mixed in. That really hit the spot and was tasty. Never had it before and I‚Äôd order it again.

The staff were busy but friendly and the interior was warm and inviting.

The cost came to ‚Ç¨13 for two."
ChIJMZA13jUmQg0R01DtNenmmVk,5,"I swear to god you can't trust reviews anymore, it's just a bunch of snobby people who didn't get one thing the way they wanted. Service was excellent, food was even better!!"
ChIJMZA13jUmQg0R01DtNenmmVk,5,What not to love about this place? Amazing food and wine with lovely friends around a great athomsphere in sunny Spain üá™üá∏
ChIJMZA13jUmQg0R01DtNenmmVk,1,"Well I just changed my review from 4 Stars to one, because today the two waiters on the terrace were absolutely terrible, the slowest service imaginable and not because they were busy, just preferred talking to each other or looking in the air. ü§¶üèº

Nice corner place. Very different to your ""typical"" Madrid bar. Has almost a US feeling to it, not in a bad way. Haven't eaten here, just had coffee. Quick and professional service"
ChIJMZA13jUmQg0R01DtNenmmVk,1,"The place is beautiful. But the service and the food sucks big time. I'm used to receiving a bad service in Spain, it's understandable, not enough staff for the amount of people coming and going... Nonetheless, I have to leave a comment cu the food was just horrible. I ordered a salmon bagel, it was impossible to give another bite after the first one, the bread was old and chewy the taste of the salmon was disgusting I'm sure I did well by not eating the whole piece. The waitress didn't say anything after returning it... This makes me wonder how this kind of businesses keep working..."
ChIJZa9cZDcmQg0Rd-a5WREgd-E,4,Five stars for the servers and ambiance. They were so friendly. Cappuccino was not as strong as I would like but the espresso was strong.
ChIJZa9cZDcmQg0Rd-a5WREgd-E,5,"The chicken sandwich was absolutely fantastic, and the owners were extremely kind and welcoming"
ChIJZa9cZDcmQg0Rd-a5WREgd-E,5,"Friendly, english-speaking service. Good prices, breakfast items included a drink. Nice aesthetic, very hipster-y."
ChIJZa9cZDcmQg0Rd-a5WREgd-E,5,Adorable cafeteria with a kind barista and excellent coffee and breakfast!
ChIJZa9cZDcmQg0Rd-a5WREgd-E,4,Great selection of bottled Spanish craft beers in this barrio caf√©. Get some on tap and I'll give you five stars!
ChIJyQCbMjQmQg0R42x-kI4yWwU,2,"For around 10 euros you'll get a full meal including drink. Good deal right? We had a hamburger. The bread was nearly inedibly dry and the patty thin and overdone. It came with a side of fries, presented as a stack. The fries were fine, but we got only about six per person. Not that great a deal after all."
ChIJyQCbMjQmQg0R42x-kI4yWwU,5,"Excellent terrace to have lunch, the food and service are amazing, specially the beef"
ChIJyQCbMjQmQg0R42x-kI4yWwU,1,Bad service and no tapas. Not recommended
ChIJyQCbMjQmQg0R42x-kI4yWwU,5,Nice place to have a drink
ChIJyQCbMjQmQg0R42x-kI4yWwU,4,Good
ChIJaxLe4zUmQg0Revr90VwEDUk,1,"poor service, took ages for the food to arrive. it was cold when it finally was served, and was given a fork and a spoon ?! for fish. Had to ask for a knife.
Looks like tourists are not welcome."
ChIJaxLe4zUmQg0Revr90VwEDUk,5,Awesome old man bar! Super nice and cheap! Don‚Äôt go next door as the prices are much higher
ChIJaxLe4zUmQg0Revr90VwEDUk,5,"Good neighbourhood restaurant with traditional Spanish homemade recipes, nice terrace and friendly staff."
ChIJaxLe4zUmQg0Revr90VwEDUk,5,"Best place in the area for breakfast, tapas and snacks. Ask for the daily specials, they're amazing!"
ChIJaxLe4zUmQg0Revr90VwEDUk,5,Delicious food and very friendly and service minded staff.
ChIJqTO04jUmQg0RvRErO3XyM10,5,"I have never actually eaten here. it's my place for a coffee and sometimes breakfast in the morning on the terrace.
Always great friendly service, nice terrace good and cheep breakfast."
ChIJqTO04jUmQg0RvRErO3XyM10,5,Friendly and cozy employees. Feels like homeü§ç
ChIJqTO04jUmQg0RvRErO3XyM10,5,"Set in a small square, provides great local food and drinks. Generous servings.  Patient  staff. Ate there twice, once as a couple and then in a group of twelve."
ChIJqTO04jUmQg0RvRErO3XyM10,1,"Food ok, nothing special. However the cook apparently is willing to reject customers who don't eat pork or have allergies. She out right refused to remove a piece of bacon from the burger. Apparently, ""es as√≠ y ya est√°"" She thinks the food is so incredible it cannot be changed. She is oblivious to the blandness that is served obviously. It's not Gordon Ramsay's or Chicote.... No idea of business if prepared to treat customers like this."
ChIJqTO04jUmQg0RvRErO3XyM10,1,"A place that is more interested in what they can take from your pocket than what they will put on your plate! 22 euro for 3 small rations and you leave hungry, never good."
ChIJTYR_7jkmQg0Rh_v5dj36PKA,5,Great place for lunch or a cup of coffee. The salad was very fresh and full. They serve fresh juices with a variety of interesting flavours and combinations - I'd recommend their Strawberry with Apple and Cucumber juice. The brownies are extremely delicious.
ChIJTYR_7jkmQg0Rh_v5dj36PKA,4,"Good place for affordable breakfast (toasts, cookies, sandwiches etc). Space looks nice, but their coffee could be better."
ChIJTYR_7jkmQg0Rh_v5dj36PKA,5,"Great place not far from Transit Hub!  Friendly staff, great food, and excellent coffee!
Highly recommend!"
ChIJTYR_7jkmQg0Rh_v5dj36PKA,1,Menu del dia was only a terrible salad. I could only eat a few bites
ChIJTYR_7jkmQg0Rh_v5dj36PKA,5,Good place for lunch. You can take away or order online. Good products homemade.
ChIJoScwfTcmQg0R8lqKwZMIKiI,2,Asked for a ca√±a and given a doble which is main reason for only 2 stars. Doble and Nestea on Terrace 4.4E with tapa of cheese and crisps. Better options in the neighbourhood for lower prices. Terrace nice though.
ChIJoScwfTcmQg0R8lqKwZMIKiI,5,Best churros in the area
ChIJoScwfTcmQg0R8lqKwZMIKiI,5,"Spectacular as always. Treatment, service, food, healthy and homemade cuisine. The best bar restaurant in the area. It has a terrace."
ChIJoScwfTcmQg0R8lqKwZMIKiI,1,"November 19, 2024
We have received humiliating treatment from a bad worker who threw us out of the bar when he brought us the drink. I asked him for a beer in a glass and he brought it to me in a glass. When I brought it I told him that I told him in a glass and he replied that he didn't have a glass, which is what there was and I told him to let him know before bringing it. And he told me to leave.
I don't think such a poorly educated person should work anywhere. He has been rude and poorly educated."
ChIJoScwfTcmQg0R8lqKwZMIKiI,5,"The food is good, but the service is exceptional! Some professionals who, as soon as you go for a few days, you already know your tastes in sugar, drinks... Recommended üíØ %"
ChIJ2TiEYTcmQg0RXVkUU7arypg,5,The best restaurant and bar in Madrid and next to where I live. Perfect service and food to match. Good for groups and families. Fast service and all food is fresh and home made!
ChIJ2TiEYTcmQg0RXVkUU7arypg,4,Excellent tapas and menu. Friendly staff and nicely decorated. I will repeat
ChIJ2TiEYTcmQg0RXVkUU7arypg,5,Good food. Nice owners. Kids friendly
ChIJ2TiEYTcmQg0RXVkUU7arypg,5,Perfect!
ChIJ2TiEYTcmQg0RXVkUU7arypg,3,High prices medium quality
ChIJT9nuLjsmQg0RxtZzTO3I6rg,5,"We usually have lunch here every day. Lunch is a great value for the cost, good food with a not too expensive cost. Antonio, the waiter, is a great professional, always attentive and responsive."
ChIJT9nuLjsmQg0RxtZzTO3I6rg,4,Started with the patatas bravas with kimchi Mayo. Best cheesecake I‚Äôve ever had and I‚Äôm from New York! The cachopo was delicious and definitely for two or maybe even three people. Thanks madre√±a!
ChIJT9nuLjsmQg0RxtZzTO3I6rg,4,"1.35E ca√±a, 2.2E Aquarius, nice service, tapa of cheese, pincho moruno and breadsticks. Bit cold in bar. No menu del dia on Sundays. More a restaurant. OK, but did not love."
ChIJT9nuLjsmQg0RxtZzTO3I6rg,5,Great food and super friendly staff. Will return here for sure. Everything was delicious.
ChIJT9nuLjsmQg0RxtZzTO3I6rg,4,"Nice Asturian restaurant, very good option for the weekly lunch menu, good for its Fabada, Judiones con setas y gambas o Cachopo. Professional and friendly service, higher than ""Cerveria"" standards.."
ChIJKSFs2GomQg0R_MM4ClaUEmg,5,We chose this coffee shop because it opens earlier and it is close to the bus station. We had a lovely breakfast the tuna toast was very tasty. Prices were affordable and the food was quick to prepare. The staff didn't speak English but were very available to understand and friendly.
ChIJKSFs2GomQg0R_MM4ClaUEmg,4,"Traditional Spanish cafeteria,  good freshly pressed orange juice and ham for breakfast"
ChIJKSFs2GomQg0R_MM4ClaUEmg,4,"Good food, nice coffee and fast service"
ChIJKSFs2GomQg0R_MM4ClaUEmg,5,It was really great!
ChIJKSFs2GomQg0R_MM4ClaUEmg,4,Very Spanish breakfast
ChIJ58GLJUYmQg0RFQZ_P7FhcJ4,4,Ok
ChIJ58GLJUYmQg0RFQZ_P7FhcJ4,5,"If you are looking for a traditional bar with good breakfasts and Mahou beers, this is your place.
Mythical place in the Legazpi area.
Serving neighbors since the 60s."
ChIJ58GLJUYmQg0RFQZ_P7FhcJ4,5,"The owner is super friendly and responds very quickly. Large place with tables to sit, as well as a bar area. Cheap and very rich and varied breakfasts. It is the trusted place to go daily!"
ChIJ58GLJUYmQg0RFQZ_P7FhcJ4,5,"Ideal to start the day with a good breakfast. Open from early hours in the morning.
Very good coffee at a fairly affordable price in the area in which it is located."
ChIJ58GLJUYmQg0RFQZ_P7FhcJ4,3,"Normal breakfast. The portion is served well. The coffee tasted good. The orange juice is small but tasty. It is well located, in a large area, we went for breakfast on a Saturday morning and the atmosphere was calm. You order at the bar and collect it at the bar, there is no service at tables."
ChIJI8K0GUcmQg0RgnATuaThfj8,3,"We stopped for a beer mid-afternoon and it was good, but we didn't find any compelling reason to return either. ‚Ç¨5 for a third and a beer seemed a little high to us. For an appetizer they gave us potato omelette, which was just right."
ChIJI8K0GUcmQg0RgnATuaThfj8,2,"Incredible, I asked for a glass of water and he gave me a bottle and told me that he didn't specify if I wanted a tap glass or a glass with a bottle, so they explained to me.

PS: ‚Ç¨2 for 500 ml and there is no heating here, I won't be back"
ChIJI8K0GUcmQg0RgnATuaThfj8,4,"Very good menu of the day, well cooked and with abundant dishes. Polite and pleasant staff. Very good value for money. Advisable."
ChIJI8K0GUcmQg0RgnATuaThfj8,4,"Aside from my partner's turkey cutlets, the rest was very tasty and well cooked. Friendly, attentive waitress and good advisor. A very pleasant meal.
Thank you"
ChIJI8K0GUcmQg0RgnATuaThfj8,5,"Highly recommended place in the Arganzuela area. Affordable prices and very well prepared food, especially the chicken. They also have a menu of the day, very good too. The owner is very friendly and attentive. His wife Mariana makes a very good soup. Great cook. Mrs. Berta who is at the bar always puts a smile on her face and works very efficiently. They play football and there is a lot of atmosphere. We will return."
ChIJLTqhzUYmQg0Rki_t-EmKoBw,5,Good food and great quantity üëå
ChIJLTqhzUYmQg0Rki_t-EmKoBw,5,Nice place to meet your friends
ChIJLTqhzUYmQg0Rki_t-EmKoBw,5,"Quality food with excellent service. Also, well priced. How to eat at home."
ChIJLTqhzUYmQg0Rki_t-EmKoBw,4,"The White Cross remains a safe bet. Their menu is very good, but their rice dishes are even better: perfect point, intense flavor and quality of the product. The attention is another point to highlight, the owner (Ana) and the rest of the staff... who make you feel comfortable. A place to enjoy great food and good service. Highly recommended!"
ChIJLTqhzUYmQg0Rki_t-EmKoBw,1,"Food: very basic and expensive, quite small dishes, of very average quality and quite expensive
Service: the one who seemed like a very nice manager, the waitress who served us... Terrible, unfriendly, unpleasant and bad service... Suffice it to say, her actual words on the issue of the bill were, ""I bring you the bill and you'll make a living"".... A table for 400 euros and you serve them like that?
Atmosphere: clean and familiar, there was nothing bad, but nothing special either"
ChIJs5ltteguQg0RQMMyj3gUMNQ,5,"I placed an order from Barcelona for leg of lamb and knuckle.
I received it in 24 hours. Very well packaged and packaged and everything was great, especially the charcoal flavor.
It certainly exceeds expectations and I will surely repeat
Thank you so much"
ChIJs5ltteguQg0RQMMyj3gUMNQ,5,"The customer service is spectacular, I wrote via WhatsApp for questions and they treated me great and called me and treated me 10.
We ordered a chicken lordet rice and a cheesecake and we loved it, very delicious and the amount of luxury.
I can only say thank you and we will repeat for sure."
ChIJs5ltteguQg0RQMMyj3gUMNQ,3,"I wanted to try it because of the good reviews it has and I have to say that it left me a little disappointed. I had a meat lasagna and I thought it was not bad, good fresh pasta, but I missed more filling and the worst of it was more tomato or bechamel, for my taste it was very dry. The potato omelet is good, but without more. The best are the chicken croquettes and the carrot cake.
I'll have to give it another chance by trying their chicken or ribs."
ChIJs5ltteguQg0RQMMyj3gUMNQ,1,"Anyone who doesn't have a good palate should try these chickens. I ordered the charcoal chicken menu which included ribs and I didn't get the full menu, it was Christmas dinner, these mistakes are unforgivable.
Plus the chicken was semi raw, anyway! A disaster.
Not recommended."
ChIJs5ltteguQg0RQMMyj3gUMNQ,5,"We ordered a senyoret rice paella (on the website it says for 4 people, but we ate 5), it was incredible, we also ordered salad and some Iberian ham croquettes, the truth is that all for 50 euros we ate 5 people, they are generous with the portions, for the same price they have increased from 6 to 8 croquettes, it is appreciated that businesses look after the citizen's pocket at this time and without taking away the quality of their products.
We will order again, without a doubt."
ChIJa4Bu5UcmQg0REXHUHXwX-hw,3,"A very useful option for those days when you can't cook. There is a wide variety of dishes and their flavors are very well done. As for the price, it seemed a little high to me, since a daily menu in any bar costs only 10% or 20% more. As for the order of the dishes, it is a bit chaotic, you see the dishes but you don't know what their ingredients are, you don't see the name of the dish either, the first ones are not separated from the second ones and when you ask, the instructions are poor and in bad manners. In my opinion I say that they have a lot of room for improvement in this.
And what was said. It is a great alternative for those days when you couldn't cook due to time."
ChIJa4Bu5UcmQg0REXHUHXwX-hw,5,"It is a place that has pleasantly surprised me. Colleagues told me that the homemade food they prepare to take away was very good. And so it is, all very rich. I ordered pasta salad that lacked a little salt and the roast chicken was very delicious, and they also give you medium. The quantities are large so you won't leave hungry. The price of ‚Ç¨7.9 is good for the quality they give you"
ChIJa4Bu5UcmQg0REXHUHXwX-hw,5,"We recently moved to the neighborhood and it is the first time we tried the food, it was delicious: we loved the rice, the chicken and the peppers stuffed with cod. We liked it so much and the dishes are so homemade that we will return without a doubt."
ChIJa4Bu5UcmQg0REXHUHXwX-hw,5,"Homemade and super delicious food. At least this is what I ordered today: bandana rice and hake. Everything freshly made and warm. Super friendly employees. The menu is 10.50 euros including dessert, drink or bread. They have many cakes and more extra things to bring you. A 10."
ChIJa4Bu5UcmQg0REXHUHXwX-hw,2,"Since they allow animals access to the premises (something that I do not see as very normal in an establishment where food is cooked and served) they should control their behavior once inside, or failing that, their owners. And if they can't, don't allow it."
ChIJRTbHr0gmQg0R6fzLL0syVO0,5,"Excellent food and service. We were very pleased with the experience. The service was very personalized and professional.  We were going to return to try the fabada the next day but did not have time as we were late for the airport. The next time we are in Madrid, this place is a must."
ChIJRTbHr0gmQg0R6fzLL0syVO0,1,"This is the first time I have been moved to post a negative review anywhere, however our experience was so negative I hope this will save you the trouble‚Ä¶ The TLDR is tourists are treated poorly vs locals‚Ä¶ we arrived around 8.30pm on a Monday night with 2 other tables present‚Ä¶we ordered 2 glasses of wine plus tapas and made an effort with our basic Spanish. Waiter tried to upsell from tapas to portiones ( double
Size). Waited 45 minutes for tapas - in the meantime several tables of locals arrived and immediately received tapas. Asked for ‚Äòla Quenta por favor‚Äô and saw the waiter  go on to serve other tables and never came
Back, so 10 minutes later asked another waiter for bill.
Once presented he asked for a tip - I usually tip and well for good service but given our experience said ‚ÄòI was fine with original bill‚Äô checked the bill then tapped credit card, but when I got home found he had added 30% tip without consent. There are plenty of fantastic tapas bars on this road but this is not one of them!!!"
ChIJRTbHr0gmQg0R6fzLL0syVO0,5,This must be one of my favourite places to eat in my neighbourhood. The food is excellent quality. The waiters are all so friendly and genuinely want you to enjoy your food and have a good time. It‚Äôs a winner for me ü•Çüçã
ChIJRTbHr0gmQg0R6fzLL0syVO0,5,"Actual review: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (2/5)

As a tourist im confused on why this has
so many positief review‚Äôs
(This is definitely a tourist trap)

Let me explain:
According to the waiter no one that day could speak english,
Yes i get it, its not their main language‚Ä¶
But why have an english menu than‚Ä¶

Talking about the menu the english menu is missing a lottt of dishes, im not joking it really is missing a lot, the Spanish menu has a lot more dishes! Theres a lot of 2+ person dishes i was looking forward to but couldn‚Äôt pick.(also didn‚Äôt get the drink card)

For some reason the waiter brought out this nice linnen for the table, my friend later pointed out that they did this only for us, anyone else with the same amount of people and table didn‚Äôt get this only tourist!

At the start we got some nice appetizers, they just brought these to us, after mentioning that my friend doesn‚Äôt eat pork the waiter came up with an alternative which was really nice of him!
‚ùóÔ∏è(The waiter didn‚Äôt tell us that the alternative cost money ‚Ç¨1,80 for tiny piece of bread that i could buy from the Lidl for ‚Ç¨0,30)‚ùóÔ∏è

Food was pretty salty, the drink we got was just a tiny bottle for one glass so it was obvious that they wanted us to buy more drinks to help with the overly salty food!

The price was okay normal price for a fancy place."
ChIJRTbHr0gmQg0R6fzLL0syVO0,5,"Great  restaurant and  bar,  nice staff   attention,  lovely food.. üòç"
ChIJj7DAvkUmQg0RCSVsqRC4FOE,5,"Noisy, very busy, but authentic Spanish food. Tasty, full of flavour and freshly made. Tiramisu is heavenly made, white fish is melting in mouth and prawns juicy with olive and garlic sauce.
Worth the wait."
ChIJj7DAvkUmQg0RCSVsqRC4FOE,4,"Very nice restaurant with tasty, varied and homemade daily set menu, with local dishes and attentive service"
ChIJj7DAvkUmQg0RCSVsqRC4FOE,5,"Great service and really tasty food. Big portions too, fresh salad, good seafood and great meat dishes. The service was fantastic, very fast and attentive. A good selection of wine. Not cheap but worth it for a good meal."
ChIJj7DAvkUmQg0RCSVsqRC4FOE,4,"Very good food, starting from the quality of the raw materials to a the preparation, simple and effective without ruining the quality of the produce."
ChIJj7DAvkUmQg0RCSVsqRC4FOE,4,Great bakery lots of choice good way to start your day
ChIJrVvxSWMnQg0RfvxL2R2a0cc,1,"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! THIS LADY AT THE BAR, VERY RUDE!!!
I was there at 8 in the morning, asked her if it‚Äôs open she just nod and dismissed me as if I‚Äôm a bother to her as she continues to clean meanwhile I sat down give her time to finish but as 15, 20, 30, 40 minutes passed still nothing from her. I was  first to arrive at this canteen yet she serve all the others.

MY WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!"
ChIJrVvxSWMnQg0RfvxL2R2a0cc,5,"A true feeling of a Cantina. Very tasty food, with great vegetarian options. Very friendly service and pleasant atmosphere (great soundtrack). Worth the detour."
ChIJrVvxSWMnQg0RfvxL2R2a0cc,5,"I came looking for some brave tubers and ended up finding happiness seasoned with aioli. Then I fell into the lamb croquettes: I cried. Not from sadness, from pure emotion. And don't get me started on the Hatori Burger, because I almost signed a mortgage to never leave this place. Sputnik's Cantina is not a restaurant: it is a religion, and I am willing to be baptized in the sauce of its nachos. Amen"
ChIJrVvxSWMnQg0RfvxL2R2a0cc,5,"The truth is that it is a cool and original place, I only have the experience of going for breakfast and the truth is that it is good.
The place is very big and spacious, as I say it is an original place.
It's a shame that at breakfast time there is only one person to attend the bar and you have to wait to be served.
In short, I like the atmosphere because of the originality."
ChIJrVvxSWMnQg0RfvxL2R2a0cc,2,"Today we were disappointed by the attitude of the waiters.

We arrived and waited at a table to be served, but when I didn't receive any attention I stopped at the bar, like on other occasions. They saw me, finished four orders and asked me what I needed, I told them a couple of coffees and they told me, now they're coming to your table. Of course they took a while.

I understand that they have a lot of people, but it doesn't cost them anything to turn around to see people and tell them that they will help you in a moment instead of ignoring you.

The same thing happened when asking for the bill. We spent more time waiting at the table than drinking coffee."
ChIJUfACTZsnQg0RYFOyHygVOkk,5,The Best
ChIJUfACTZsnQg0RYFOyHygVOkk,5,Amazing food
ChIJUfACTZsnQg0RYFOyHygVOkk,5,"The truth is that I will return to Madrid again and the first thing I will do is visit the place and eat again
Both the food and the attention given to you by the staff who work there are good, haven't you tried the yucca chips? I recommend that you do it there!!!!!  because they are the best but also the shredded meat empanadas and the pastries and the patterns and the cabimera arepas well in short everything is to taste be careful I didn't have time to take a photo of the yucca potato because I eat it all at once"
ChIJUfACTZsnQg0RYFOyHygVOkk,5,"Super recommended, the food is delicious and plenty, I went with my partner who is Venezuelan and says that now I have tried real Venezuelan food, the place is very clean and it is a pleasure to be there, the guy who served us was very friendly and was always attentive.
We will definitely return!!"
ChIJUfACTZsnQg0RYFOyHygVOkk,5,"If you are a maracucho or you love Venezuelan food, you have to go to this place. Here you will find the most unique yucca chips in Madrid, crunchy and with that flavor that transports you directly to Maracaibo. And not to mention the mandocas, they are the best in the entire city! Highly recommended!"
ChIJbaZiBnEnQg0RPuexDD1Y3xA,5,"WOW!
Everything was delicious.
Prices are worth what you're gonna eat.
Good size portions, various choices and quality products.
Cozy place with chill vibes and a very friendly service."
ChIJbaZiBnEnQg0RPuexDD1Y3xA,5,The Best Japanese in the area.
ChIJbaZiBnEnQg0RPuexDD1Y3xA,5,"We went to dinner at this sushi restaurant today with my sister and a friend, and the experience was simply spectacular. Everything was delicious from the first bite. The niguiris were my favorites: fresh, well prepared and with a flavor that leaves you wanting more.

The attention was another point to highlight. Our waitress was super friendly, attentive at all times and made us feel very comfortable. It's nice when they treat you like this!

And to close with a flourish‚Ä¶ the desserts. My God! A total delight. Every detail, from presentation to taste, was perfect. Without a doubt, a place I would return to a thousand times."
ChIJbaZiBnEnQg0RPuexDD1Y3xA,5,"Cozy and comfortable place.
Attention of 10 by the staff.
Good quality of products and good flavor.
The Bao are highly recommended, what we liked the most.
If it can be completed with a dessert we recommend the cheese coulant, it is not strong and has a very pleasant flavor"
ChIJbaZiBnEnQg0RPuexDD1Y3xA,5,"I thought it was excellent. Price/quality 10.
The attention was great, they explained everything to us with great professionalism, without being intrusive but attentive. We ordered the tasting for two, super abundant and very delicious.
The Bao de la Dispo is very good.
to return"
ChIJH-2z3CcnQg0RLuHTN-G1hgk,5,"It's my pleasure to be in that establishment
Great atmosphere, perfect service and food was just amazing üëè"
ChIJH-2z3CcnQg0RLuHTN-G1hgk,4,"The only nuance is that they do not have gluten-free beer. I give them 4 stars for their kindness and for giving me olives as a tapa despite having put another tapa before, I asked them later because it was what I could have and they gave it to me without problems. Thank you."
ChIJH-2z3CcnQg0RLuHTN-G1hgk,5,"From the moment you walk through the door, this restaurant surrounds you with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The carefully chosen d√©cor creates a perfect balance between elegance and comfort, making it the ideal location for both an intimate dinner and a gathering with friends or family.

The service is simply impeccable. The staff is attentive, professional and always ready to offer sound recommendations. It is clear that they are well trained and that they enjoy their work, which is reflected in the friendly treatment and the speed with which they attend to every detail.

As for the food, it is a true masterpiece. Each dish is prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients, presented with an impeccable aesthetic. I especially highlight the scrambled egg with chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãand egg, which combines intense flavors and a perfect texture, leaving an unforgettable memory on the palate. In addition, the menu is varied, with options that satisfy both lovers of traditional cuisine and those looking for more innovative proposals.

Another plus point is the selection of drinks. The wine list is extensive and carefully curated to pair with the different dishes. They also have creative cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks that complement the dining experience.

In short, this restaurant offers a complete experience: a pleasant atmosphere, first-class service and cuisine that delights all the senses. Without a doubt, it is a place you will want to return to again and again."
ChIJH-2z3CcnQg0RLuHTN-G1hgk,5,"Very good food (better than in other more expensive places), very good service and very friendly people... Good experience, we will repeat..."
ChIJH-2z3CcnQg0RLuHTN-G1hgk,5,"Spectacular food and treatment on par, I would say unbeatable, we ordered many dishes and they took just the right amount of time, everything homemade, it shows."
ChIJfV90_UYmQg0RZNuexDKYcBg,5,"A fantastic lunch on a Sunday in Madrid. I had chicken nachos and beef tacos. Not the ultimate judge on Mexican cuisine as I just started exploring it, albeit passionately and I am loving it, I realized the place was swarming with locals, all of whom ordered rounds of food and drinks, and comfortably enjoyed their time, I clearly observed."
ChIJfV90_UYmQg0RZNuexDKYcBg,5,"Great place near Legazpi for Mexican food. Everything we had tasted great. The service was amazing especially by David. We didnt have a reservation. He accommodated us and gave a nice table. The place is beautifully decorated too.
Would definitely return."
ChIJfV90_UYmQg0RZNuexDKYcBg,5,"The food is genuinely 10/10, so much flavour I was smiling and nodding at my girlfriend with every bite. We went for the sharing plate (fajitas Ju√°rez). The atmosphere is very tranquil and the staff are friendly. Thank you for the experience, and a special thanks to Carlos!"
ChIJfV90_UYmQg0RZNuexDKYcBg,5,"Mexican restaurant in Legazpi üåÆüçπ The variety of mouthwatering Mexican dishes, from tacos to nachos, left me craving for more. But the real star of the show was their margarita selection ‚Äì both the classic and tamarind flavors were incredibly flavorful and satisfying.

The staff's warm and friendly demeanor, coupled with their professionalism, made the dining experience even more enjoyable.

If you're a fan of authentic Mexican cuisine and crave that perfect margarita, this place is an absolute must-visit. üá≤üáΩüç¥"
ChIJfV90_UYmQg0RZNuexDKYcBg,5,"Delicious food, very friendly staff and a very cozy interior. Best Mexican restaurant in Madrid!"
ChIJHz6LMugnQg0ReX3Bu_idnlA,3,The food wasn‚Äôt bad. It was decent but not worthy of the price. Service and attention was good.
ChIJHz6LMugnQg0ReX3Bu_idnlA,1,q horror
ChIJHz6LMugnQg0ReX3Bu_idnlA,4,"Today, Friday, we went to eat and we liked it. We have known about it for a long time and they have improved a lot. The beginnings tend to be a bit chaotic. The service was very friendly, the food was very delicious (the bluefin tuna is very good and the portion is large, but I recommend that anyone who likes it less done should say so so that the kitchen can prepare it half more done and half less done), the very nice tableware. Details that help make everything better and more pleasant. The price is average for this neighborhood of expensive brick houses, at impossible prices and restaurants with different options. It's ""fashion."""
ChIJHz6LMugnQg0ReX3Bu_idnlA,4,"Good food overall. Nice and attentive service.
The croquettes are not good, the chicken nuggets are very tasty, the burgers are big and homemade... it took a long time to bring them, yes. I think it's expensive, but it has a good menu and looks good."
ChIJHz6LMugnQg0ReX3Bu_idnlA,4,It is the first time we went to eat at El Malecon restaurant. Good menu with plenty of variety. There were 6 of us and we have ordered a variety of dishes. In general it was good but the rice was not wonderful and neither was the Steak Tartar. A little expensive and it took them a long time to bring the second dish.
ChIJ4xQNaYQnQg0RwAORMGY4p_Q,5,The place is spotless and quiet. Ideal for a quick and healthy snack or lunch. I had one of their smoothies and it was very fresh and tasty. I am sure I will come back soon!
ChIJ4xQNaYQnQg0RwAORMGY4p_Q,1,I ordered through Uber eats and some of the toppings were missing. I even ordered a premium topping and its also missing.  There were vegetables but very little. So disappointing! ‚òπÔ∏è
ChIJ4xQNaYQnQg0RwAORMGY4p_Q,4,"If I compare the aloha poke placed in otorrino locations, this time the service was not friendly and it was too little amount of protein. If I go to aloha poke again, I‚Äôll go to the other one."
ChIJ4xQNaYQnQg0RwAORMGY4p_Q,5,"We love Aloha Pok√©, and especially this location. They do an incredible job getting our orders, are always attentive when there‚Äôs any issue (even when we‚Äôve accidentally called them for orders that were from actually another branch), and are kind in every interaction. They even included a special birthday surprise message when we ordered on my birthday.
The food is fresh and healthy and always delicious, comes quickly, and in environmentally friendly packaging. Thank you Aloha team! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
ChIJ4xQNaYQnQg0RwAORMGY4p_Q,5,"Delicious pok√© bowls with fresh ingredients, friendly staff, and great variety of flavors. Also love their fresh juices and desserts. One of our new favorite spots in the neighborhood!"
ChIJA6qVOaInQg0RVqA58yIu2Sc,5,"Super good, and fragrant food. The Spanish specialties are special, except the Cajun meat which made me remove a star.... IT WAS RAW!!"
ChIJQSvm0sInQg0RkVoPsAnLhqs,5,"Jorge was amazing!

My first time here in Spain as a Canadian and I made sure to try out one of my favorite Hispanic appetizer Empanadas. I searched and I found Malv√≥n as being one of the best in the area and the service was on point! I hope I Will come back again, however I brought some home and my friends enjoyed it. Thank you Jorge and Malv√≥n!

Kind regards,
Andy"
ChIJQSvm0sInQg0RkVoPsAnLhqs,5,It was a really nice experience and the best thing I've ever tasted. I fell in love with the provolone tomate one. I also tried their small desserts called alfajores. The price was affordable and the taste was excellent.  It became a place I would go back to and it made my day go very well. I recommend you to go. Also the employee is very helpful. He answered all our questions in detail.
ChIJQSvm0sInQg0RkVoPsAnLhqs,5,"The service is incredible, and the empanadas were delicious!! The ambiance is really cozy, and the price is very fair for the quality and quantities! Loved it and will be coming back :)"
ChIJQSvm0sInQg0RkVoPsAnLhqs,5,This place is really good with variety of delicious empanadas üá¶üá∑. A must if you're near this area of Madrid and the service was really good as well üëçüèΩ
ChIJQSvm0sInQg0RkVoPsAnLhqs,5,This is my favorite empanadas place in Madrid. Keep your bar high!
ChIJv4HjMEYmQg0RhNbwC_jupWM,4,"This a great  place to have dinner in this neighborhood. The prices offered are very reasonable. The service was quick. The food was good.

The interior is clean and spacious. I enjoyed the ambient music too.

My table ordered the beef gyozas, the chow mien and the lemon chicken. All dishes were good.

I will definitely come back to try more dishes on the menu."
ChIJv4HjMEYmQg0RhNbwC_jupWM,5,"It's a great Sushi place and I really like it. Easily the best in the area. Good quality food, good choice, prices are ok for the quality. I like the decor and the service is really good as well.
I have been twice for dinner now and will definitely go again.
Highly recommended."
ChIJv4HjMEYmQg0RhNbwC_jupWM,5,"We were so pleased with our visit here! Very clean restaurant with attractive, modern decor. The staff were very welcoming, helpful and attentive.

We speak English with pretty limited Spanish so the manager came and helped us with the menu, made some great recommendations for a balanced meal. The food was delicious and we felt valued the entire time.

Thank you StyleShanghai!"
ChIJv4HjMEYmQg0RhNbwC_jupWM,5,"Wonderful service. Staff were really helpful with our limited Spanish and their limited English. Food was delicious, wine was great."
ChIJv4HjMEYmQg0RhNbwC_jupWM,5,This is a hidden gem !!!  Truly tasty food !  Will return for sure !
ChIJKQPCNe4nQg0R2NCvrJv19V4,1,No vegan options.
ChIJKQPCNe4nQg0R2NCvrJv19V4,2,"Poor quantities for such prices, service really good though"
ChIJKQPCNe4nQg0R2NCvrJv19V4,5,"Noathi destaca no solo por su exquisita propuesta gastron√≥mica, sino tambi√©n por el ambiente que se ha logrado crear, un lugar donde cada detalle est√° cuidadosamente pensado para transportar al comensal a un mundo de sensaciones inolvidables.

Desde el momento en que entras, el trato personalizado del personal es inmediato y genuino.

El men√∫ es una verdadera obra maestra, con una fusi√≥n de sabores tradicionales y toques innovadores que se combinan perfectamente."
ChIJKQPCNe4nQg0R2NCvrJv19V4,5,"The prices are somewhat high, however the food and service are spectacular. Totally worth it, 100% repeatable. The cheesecake with violet ice cream is too good.
I didn't take many photos of the food, it didn't look as good as it was.
I recommend the brothy rice with red prawns‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJKQPCNe4nQg0R2NCvrJv19V4,5,"We ate great and had a very pleasant time. The place is well taken care of and the service is very pleasant and attentive. We ordered several dishes and everything was delicious. To add a ""but"", for my taste the partridge was a little dry, but as I said it is a personal opinion and in no way detracts from their cooking."
ChIJZzY9UDMmQg0R_Sq3rnJfDes,3,"It was OK. Good food but a bit overpriced (75‚Ç¨ 2ppl no wine)
Service so-so, they were a bit distracted"
ChIJZzY9UDMmQg0R_Sq3rnJfDes,2,Too expensive
ChIJZzY9UDMmQg0R_Sq3rnJfDes,1,"We had gone to eat the menu of the day on several occasions but today the service was regrettable, the chicken was not cooked, we asked for more and they put it in the microwave, for them it seems normal.

When asking for explanations, it was something incomprehensible, the cook came and turned around with contempt towards the customers.

You will never see us in this restaurant again, there is a reason it must always be almost empty.

In the complaint form he has not filled in the details of the premises, that says everything about the moral character of this person.

Despite everything, the claim has been filed with the corresponding public body."
ChIJZzY9UDMmQg0R_Sq3rnJfDes,5,"100% recommended place. Excellent cuisine, quiet atmosphere both inside and on its wonderful terrace and unbeatable service."
ChIJZzY9UDMmQg0R_Sq3rnJfDes,5,"Everything is delicious, comfortable, clean and spacious.
My Recommendations: grilled avocado ü•ë and a pasta dish with salmon üç£ and black cuttlefish sauce (outstanding) coffee ‚òïÔ∏è wine üç∑ and gin and tonic ü•Ç original and very good too"
ChIJw_yWE0wnQg0RvDmTAEBK47s,5,"We were waiting for the new renovation of the restaurant. A very cozy and bright place. It also has a heated terrace, although we have not enjoyed it yet. As for the product, it has the most traditional of our cuisine and delicious Peruvian dishes.
Very tasty food and correct quantities.
We will surely return."
ChIJw_yWE0wnQg0RvDmTAEBK47s,1,"We have ordered chaufa rice and have eaten several pieces of egg shell. It is a VERY SERIOUS oversight since I am pregnant, but even if I were not, it is also very dangerous. The risk of salmonella poisoning is high. I hope you are more careful, we will not return until after the risk period in which I find myself."
ChIJw_yWE0wnQg0RvDmTAEBK47s,5,"An incredible experience in this cozy restaurant with homemade food. From the moment we walked in, the warm and familiar atmosphere made us feel at home. The dishes are a true delight; You can see the love and care in each recipe. We tried the garlic chicken, which was perfectly seasoned and had a tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture. Also the paella, which had an authentic and homemade flavor, like the one my grandmother prepared. The service was excellent, with friendly and attentive staff. Without a doubt, we will return to continue enjoying these traditional flavors. Highly recommended for those looking for quality, comforting food."
ChIJw_yWE0wnQg0RvDmTAEBK47s,5,"We have been delighted, perfect service and attention and good quality food and good price. We will repeat...
100% Recommended"

ChIJV-TuhNcnQg0RDIlFcIIGAzI,3,"We had an aperitif there. The terrace is pleasant. The beer is cold and they have Mahou. The appetizers fail, very basic. I didn't like the vermouth. The service a little slow, but correct."
ChIJV-TuhNcnQg0RDIlFcIIGAzI,1,"The waiters and service really can't do anything more. They work piecework making the food themselves, serving and all the functions. The mixed sandwich that they have given us is regrettable but it is normal that they don't give us more. Today there were like 200 people and you can't run a place with two people like that... Whoever runs this place should really be ashamed."
ChIJV-TuhNcnQg0RDIlFcIIGAzI,1,"We ordered drinks and they brought us a small bowl of chips. When we were reaching the bottom of the bowl we found the surprise, there a beautiful cigarette butt was waiting for us. Crushed, rolling, but recent. Which clearly shows that those bowls see little soap and water.

We told the waitress. We didn't receive an apology, nothing.

Now, to add constructive criticism, since they have a large bathroom on the lower floor, a children's changing table wasn't going to hurt anyone."
ChIJV-TuhNcnQg0RDIlFcIIGAzI,1,"The ""MANAGER"" as she says she is, looks at us with a defiant face since a few months ago we consumed both adults and children at a different table but she did not like that, after some inappropriate discussions and very rude because she did not like that the children were using a table, today she tells us that she does not serve us because the children who were there were a bad influence (we are talking about children of 6, 7 and 9 years old) we asked for the complaint form and they denied it since she says that now we have not consumed. Finally he gives it to us. I appeal to the owner of the establishment to even contact me in a polite manner, something that the manager lacks, she can explain to him what type of person runs his establishment."
ChIJV-TuhNcnQg0RDIlFcIIGAzI,5,"Casa Lautrec is an excellent option to enjoy a meal outdoors. Its terrace is quite large and the service is spectacular, the service is very attentive and the waiters are very friendly. The truth is that for me, of all the restaurants in the area, it is the best."
ChIJG42Q-WcnQg0RXiSKPpXBAow,5,Uh uh uh MAZING!! The pizza was amazing. The service was amazing. The ice cream was amazing! The price is good too! Go here.
ChIJG42Q-WcnQg0RXiSKPpXBAow,5,"100% recommended for ice creams and cr√™pes and THE brioche (ask the ice cream brioche).
It also serves lunch and diner. Italian."
ChIJG42Q-WcnQg0RXiSKPpXBAow,5,"Delicious Italian style Pizza and pastas.
A big selection of gelato with sugar free and organic options.

Espresso was from organic coffee beans and had a velvety finish.

We took the kids and the restaurant is very kid friendly. While we were there we could count at least 5 other families. Plenty of space outside for the kids to move and run around."
ChIJG42Q-WcnQg0RXiSKPpXBAow,5,Excellent gelatos... Ask for the Mango/Naranja Sanguina combination üôå
ChIJG42Q-WcnQg0RXiSKPpXBAow,5,"Excellent service and great quality food, love it"
ChIJ07uD8kcmQg0RxfN-uFePsU4,3,"Small gastrobar with modern Spanish food. The creamy rice with oxtail and mushrooms was delicious. We also liked the leek confit. The Russian salad, however, tasted flat. Great torrija for dessert. Overall, though, the food is overpriced for what it is. Service is not attentive, either. And, surprisingly for a place called ""Divino Tinto"", they're very reluctant to give you any explanations about the wines they have."
ChIJ07uD8kcmQg0RxfN-uFePsU4,3,"The place is OK but very small. You can only sit if you have dinner. They always put reserved signs, even if empty. Food is Ok, some are good like canelones de toro, others not good like tartar de at√∫n. They try to cook fancy food but it falls a bit short. Food is expensive for what it is. Desserts are Ok, torrija de brioche wss good but I had it better in other places. Service was Ok. Wineis OK.
Overall OK but small and expensive."
ChIJ07uD8kcmQg0RxfN-uFePsU4,5,We were very welcomed into the restaurant.  The staff were amazing. Great üëç service and food. A lot of fun. We enjoyed our night immensely.  I would definitely go back there next time I am in Madrid.
ChIJ07uD8kcmQg0RxfN-uFePsU4,5,We are two couples from Australia staying in the local area.  We went to Divino Tinto tonight for dinner and it was wonderful.  We do not speak Spanish and the staff went out of their way to assist us. The food was divine and the service perfect. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience in Madrid.
ChIJ07uD8kcmQg0RxfN-uFePsU4,5,"A fantastic gem in the neighbourhood. Always a feast, with such nice service, food and wines. Try the experience, it's a big little place!!"
ChIJpwtykvYnQg0R0hEOl69vksc,5,"Amazing place! In my quest to go to one bar in every neighborbood in Madrid (131 total neighborhoods), my friend and I went to El Despacho Clandestino and it was phenomenal. The pickled anchovie (boquerones en vinagre) toast with roasted red peppers was great!  Also, the service was fantastic. (My instagram is andrew_discovers_madrid if you want to see the post/reel I made about my visit to the bar)"
ChIJpwtykvYnQg0R0hEOl69vksc,3,Singular
ChIJpwtykvYnQg0R0hEOl69vksc,3,"The metal neighborhood area has very interesting places to enjoy eating.
We ordered a bottle of red wine, Ni√±o Le√≥n was the waitress's recommendation, and two dishes to share.
The quantities of food were good and everything cost us about 31 euros, a normal price for Madrid. The food, without further ado, is correct.
I recommend the place if you are in the area and want to have some wines, the atmosphere was very calm."
ChIJpwtykvYnQg0R0hEOl69vksc,5,"Very good atmosphere, Cristobal and Ana make the place a cozy and pleasant place, they know how to recommend a good wine as a good dish, spectacular food, an 11 out of 10, cockle ceviche, salmon tartare, curried turkey meatballs with yogurt and Tandoori prawns, truly delicious dishes, and the desserts are not far behind!  üòãüòã"
ChIJpwtykvYnQg0R0hEOl69vksc,4,We were having a few drinks after dinner. Good variety of wines. We will have to try it as a wine bar. Very good music especially from the 60s and 70s.
ChIJQXlfvkgmQg0ROjpEA8zG6uU,5,Fantastic little spot on a quiet street. The owner seemed to know everyone who came in (including me on my 3rd visit in 3 days). Restaurant / Tapas Bar. Friendly staff and classic tapas. The diners‚Äô food looked terrific too. Really homely.
ChIJQXlfvkgmQg0ROjpEA8zG6uU,2,"This was actually my third time dining here, the first two I overlooked the obvious issues the restaurant has on cleanliness and service because the quality of the product and the way they cooked it were great, so this is normal in Spain, to eat great in a manky place.

But yesterday it was a huge mistake, end of July on a Thursday, so the product was not fresh and the regular cook was on holidays (the worst was the cuttlefish which needed at least 5 more minutes on the grill), the ear was chewy and not well cut and the octopus looked like it was from last week...the only thing that had a pass were the baby squids.

So, if you take out the quality of the product and the great cooking, then all the other defects become unbearable, this was my last time here for sure."
ChIJQXlfvkgmQg0ROjpEA8zG6uU,5,Seafood is the best in Madrid the meat that you cook on the stone was also very tasty.
ChIJQXlfvkgmQg0ROjpEA8zG6uU,3,Regular
ChIJQXlfvkgmQg0ROjpEA8zG6uU,5,Delicius!!!!!
ChIJr6jHw0cmQg0RIMikF38GdGE,5,Great pizza bar. Cold beer and excellent service and staff. And I love the River Plate colors. Un bar de barrio que nunca defrauda.
ChIJr6jHw0cmQg0RIMikF38GdGE,5,"A great option to have a few beers and have something light in the neighborhood. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff, always very attentive and pleasant, makes you feel comfortable. It is a perfect place to relax after the week and share good times with friends or neighbors. Plus, the nearby location makes it very convenient."
ChIJr6jHw0cmQg0RIMikF38GdGE,5,"Nat and Ale are the best ü©µ
It is the best bar in the neighborhood to have a drink on the terrace without a doubt and inside it is very cozy.
Furthermore, our dog is treated wonderfully and is always welcome.

Regarding the food, the toasts are very good and the tapas are always great.

Always recommended! üòâ"
ChIJr6jHw0cmQg0RIMikF38GdGE,5,"Small bar in the Legazpi area.
They have many varieties of red, white and ros√© wines.
The place is small, but charming and cozy.
I will surely return ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJr6jHw0cmQg0RIMikF38GdGE,5,"I have been there more than 5 times and it is a place that I love for its wines, pizzas and cakes. Natalia recommended us and treated us very well the last time I went."
ChIJ68_D4MwnQg0RHb3KaKNrWus,5,"Hamaca Restaurante Colombiano is a vibrant and authentic culinary gem located in the Legazpi area of Madrid, on Calle del Teniente General Nore√±a. This spot is a true celebration of Colombia‚Äôs rich gastronomic traditions, offering an inviting atmosphere that feels like stepping into a slice of Colombia itself.

The restaurant‚Äôs colorful d√©cor and warm ambiance create the perfect setting for enjoying classic Colombian dishes. The menu is a delightful journey through the country‚Äôs diverse flavors, featuring standout options like arepas, empanadas, and the iconic bandeja paisa, a hearty dish loaded with rice, beans, fried egg, plantains, chorizo, and succulent grilled meats. For those who enjoy lighter fare, the ceviche de camar√≥n is fresh and tangy, while the traditional ajiaco soup warms the soul with its comforting blend of chicken, potatoes, and corn.

Pair your meal with authentic Colombian beverages such as aguapanela, lulo juice, or a cup of the country‚Äôs renowned coffee. To end on a sweet note, the tres leches cake or postre de natas will leave you truly satisfied.

The prices are very reasonable, and the portions are generous, making it a great value. The staff is exceptionally friendly and attentive, eager to ensure every guest has a memorable dining experience.

For anyone in Madrid craving an authentic taste of Colombia, Hamaca Restaurante Colombiano in Legazpi is a must-visit destination."
ChIJ68_D4MwnQg0RHb3KaKNrWus,5,"Really delicious food

ChIJ884tNhMmQg0RC5bR00ymSVI,2,"Waitress seemed upset that we went inside. She was not rude but she was very rough in her service. Right away made us feel uncomfortable.
We ordered the parrilla for 2. At first it looked like it was worth the 25 ‚Ç¨, but after we started eating I noticed that the meat consisted mostly of fat and skins. The little meat I saw in it tasted good. The meat seemed like it had been cooked hours ago and they just reheated it. I might be wrong.
Bottom line, I wouldn't come back, I'd rather spend that money somewhere else."
ChIJ884tNhMmQg0RC5bR00ymSVI,4,Nice place for a business casual meal or socialising with friends
ChIJ884tNhMmQg0RC5bR00ymSVI,4,High quality service and food prices are average. Try beef it is incredible...
ChIJ884tNhMmQg0RC5bR00ymSVI,4,Friendly staff tasty food at a reasonable price

ChIJV9P0LuYlQg0RkMKeqLdkpmc,2,"It's a dinos, you know what you go for, decent pasta and pizza at ok price. The low rating is due to the speed of service. They are nice but soooooo slow."
ChIJV9P0LuYlQg0RkMKeqLdkpmc,5,Very nice!
ChIJV9P0LuYlQg0RkMKeqLdkpmc,5,Great place to eat with kids!
ChIJV9P0LuYlQg0RkMKeqLdkpmc,3,Good place for italian food.
ChIJkVhsAhUmQg0REw2O9NI2puY,4,"A very competent VIPS. It‚Äôs close to Estaci√≥n Sur and a whole lot of office buildings, therefore it‚Äôs always full at lunchtime. That said, unlike even some less busy locations, they take you to your table quickly and serve you even quicker. They‚Äôre perfectly aware of their role in the neighborhood. That said, it‚Äôs also slightly louder than other locations because of this. Food is good. Had several sandwiches here. Service people look super busy but not stressed."
ChIJkVhsAhUmQg0REw2O9NI2puY,3,"VIPS was great in terms of welcoming the customers and explaining the menu to us, moreover it amazed us on ""Good Night Menu""
The staff were friendly and very helpful.
The place is warm.
Prices are average, but the ""Good Night offer"" is cool, and the refill for drinks is only 1‚Ç¨
Burger was yummi and juicy!
Sandwich was so delicious i loved it.
They offer ketchup, mayo and mastered for free.
The brownie i did not like. Was cold and not yummi."
ChIJkVhsAhUmQg0REw2O9NI2puY,2,"Our first time at VIPS. Large portions, quite expensive tasteless food. We left most of one dish. Milkshake was undrinkable, it tasted like it was so full of sugar or chemicals."
ChIJkVhsAhUmQg0REw2O9NI2puY,3,"The ceasar aalad was panned fried chicken and you could not choose grilled chicken, that was a downer, too few croutons and the garlic bread didn't taste to garlicky... Otherwise it was ok."
ChIJkVhsAhUmQg0REw2O9NI2puY,5,"VIPS is a great spot for casual dining in Madrid! The menu has a wide variety of options, and the food is always tasty. The service is quick and friendly, and it‚Äôs perfect for a relaxed meal with friends."
ChIJ8ZzItBQmQg0Ry2lbhj5Aofg,3,I didn't expect much anyway but the limited time offer (double crispy chicken burger with goat cheese) was terrible. Onion rings were fluffy as well. Unlimited drinks were attractive
ChIJ8ZzItBQmQg0Ry2lbhj5Aofg,3,"First part was not the stores fault but there was a group of 20 kids having a party screaming and yelling, glad they had outdoor seats. Unfortunately we were behind the parent/guardian that was ordering and took him a good 5-6 minutes to make the order. There was a massive queue behind us you would think they would get someone else on the register."
ChIJ8ZzItBQmQg0Ry2lbhj5Aofg,1,"It was the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant, and in particular at a BK. I went to the waitress at the counter to report that the code to remove the drink was not working. The first time I removed one of these and when I wanted to remove another one, it didn't work. I tried in Spanish and she didn't understand. Then I tried English and she gave me a new glass to take another drink saying I could take any other. She didn't understand that the code didn't work. I tried to go to the machine again when I heard the waitress who served me speaking in Spanish to other customers that I didn't know how to explain, neither in Spanish nor English, and she didn't know what I wanted. Saying this and laughing. I, who was upset about it, told her that I understood Spanish and I didn't like listen to her talking about me behind my back. It was then that a very nervous and excited security guard appeared and, without knowing what was going on, he had excessive authority, was super threatening, arrogant and wanted to make things worse. This gentleman didn't understand what happened, even when I tried to say what happened and I'm angry at hearing the waitress laugh and talk about me behind my back. He thought I wanted to drink more juice than I was allowed (1 hour). Without wanting to speak in a way that would make him understand what was going on, I touched his arm and he got excited and told me 10 times in a super excited and exaggerated way that I wouldn't touch him. and he rudely repeated that I couldn't re fill any more drinks for more than 1 hour. and when I showed him the time of purchase he found that it had only been 20 minutes since the purchase. This gentleman wanted to get into trouble, it seemed to me that he would resort to violence if I said anything more to him. Horrible place, people without preparation and education. I advise you not to go there."
ChIJ8ZzItBQmQg0Ry2lbhj5Aofg,1,"They were already closed before it was actually closing time, as in not just unwilling to cook food, but literally closed. Never have I seen that happen with a large fast food chain restaurant."
ChIJ8ZzItBQmQg0Ry2lbhj5Aofg,2,"Overpriced junk food: supposedly a large menu of crispy chicken burger thing in flaky bread bun that disintegrated when picked up (probably half-stale), with poorly cooked and undersalted fries. (The first batch of fries were cold). Portion-size of the fries did not strike me as large.
I was given three sachets of tomato ketchup (and a stack of serviettes) but it would still cost me 50 cents more to exchange them for some mayonnaise. The only thing that tasted right was the Coke.
And they claim there is no food contact but orders are encouraged on a huge screen which must be handled by all and sundry - no sign of disinfectant hand gel anywhere in the restaurant, so I brought my own in, shared them around, and all over my food before leaving a trail of waste paper and plastic to be disposed of.
Conclusion: you'd have to be desperate to come here or, like me, a stranger in town wanting something quick and fuss-free whilst waiting for a bus."
ChIJ9Uyh4RQmQg0Rin1KRaptcdk,5,Needed somewhere to eat while waiting an hour for my next bus. The staff were kind and my chow mein was pretty good and came out quickly. Menu has allergen information too which was really helpful. Would definitely come again if in the area!
ChIJ9Uyh4RQmQg0Rin1KRaptcdk,2,"I have ordered from this Thai place a few times now, each and every time the delivery takes close to an hour with an ETA on the order of 30 mins. When I call the restaurant to check my order they are always ""very sorry but today we have many  followed by orders, followed by laughter. ""Tuesday at 3pm...I doubt it.
Food is OK, service is poor"
ChIJ9Uyh4RQmQg0Rin1KRaptcdk,5,Really good Asian food presented in a good way. Don't forget to order rice to the curry.. :)
ChIJ9Uyh4RQmQg0Rin1KRaptcdk,4,good korean rice and spring rolls. glovo had a nice offer so we got 2for1 üòÅ
ChIJ9Uyh4RQmQg0Rin1KRaptcdk,5,"Very Delicious

Fried rice

All is delicious"
ChIJQ2CC3RQmQg0RWqoqZiZVnF4,1,"Quick summary: NO GO
As seen in picture, the food had a pigeon droppings. When asked the service about it, they simply ignored us, just like they had done when we asked what beers they had for the ordering...
Plus, there were multiple drunks in the surroundings bothering the clients."
ChIJQ2CC3RQmQg0RWqoqZiZVnF4,5,The only thing open on Sundays early is their sandwiches are really good.
ChIJQ2CC3RQmQg0RWqoqZiZVnF4,5,Best chicken sandwich i‚Äôve had in Spain. Thanks
ChIJQ2CC3RQmQg0RWqoqZiZVnF4,5,"This was a great place for breakfast. Really nice pastries, clean environment and good service. I ordered a bocadillo de queso (solo) so I‚Äôd recommend having butter or tomato with it. My mate had an amazing bocadillo de tortilla. Nice mini bottles of cava and good coffee too."
ChIJQ2CC3RQmQg0RWqoqZiZVnF4,5,"Nice place to have dinner, and a great visit"
ChIJQXQb7DwmQg0RoFCT_cHqegI,2,The prices are higher than in the city and the quality is not that good. The tomato was not fresh and the juice taste like was mixed with water. The Rodilla is good in general but this one is no the same standard.
ChIJQXQb7DwmQg0RoFCT_cHqegI,1,Was 6am and I wasn't allowed to put my head on the table to rest slightly as a paying customer! You cannot even order propertly because the server didn't know about the menu. The staff were incredibly rude and the sandwich was mediocre at best and wildly overpriced. Will not be returning
ChIJQXQb7DwmQg0RoFCT_cHqegI,2,"We purchased the 10-pack for ‚Ç¨15.6, and it was surprising to us that the sandwiches in the window are plumper than the ones stacked behind (which we were given). Also sad that the price didn‚Äôt reflect in the taste of these crust-cut, fun-looking sandwiches. We got 10 different flavors, from salmon to veggie to tuna to bleu cheese. Some were certainly better than others. While it was novel and fun, we won‚Äôt be returning."
ChIJQXQb7DwmQg0RoFCT_cHqegI,1,Didn't even get to order since the lady on the counter was rude and wouldn't let me take a look at the menu.
ChIJQXQb7DwmQg0RoFCT_cHqegI,1,Long waiting time and high prices
ChIJZ9alYWUmQg0Rrp4qre4rib8,5,"Amazing pizza and original brazilian one. If you like great pizzas, cozy place and nice people, you must visit it. It is also delivering to several points in Madrid. I really recommend this place."
ChIJZ9alYWUmQg0Rrp4qre4rib8,2,11 euro‚Äôs for a tiny pizza without many toppings‚Ä¶ very disappointing
ChIJZ9alYWUmQg0Rrp4qre4rib8,5,Very good

ChIJXYbteHEmQg0RI-jxfqbWvwQ,4,"Good quality, great tempura, and very quick and convenient"
ChIJXYbteHEmQg0RI-jxfqbWvwQ,4,The best snails and the very nice Chinese. It is true that the cleanliness leaves something to be desired but with a space suit you can go in and pee peacefully.
ChIJXYbteHEmQg0RI-jxfqbWvwQ,4,The appearance is not the best but the service and quality are within the norm.
ChIJXYbteHEmQg0RI-jxfqbWvwQ,1,"I don't like it too much, it's very old."
ChIJXYbteHEmQg0RI-jxfqbWvwQ,5,Very good I loved the appetizers
ChIJmYU0PW4mQg0RRuIe6BgKQok,5,The food came very fast although we were a lot of people. Impressive. The flamenco was cool too.
ChIJmYU0PW4mQg0RRuIe6BgKQok,4,"Excellent place to enjoy Spanish specialties including foods, drinks and culture, just a bit inconvenient for public transportation."
ChIJmYU0PW4mQg0RRuIe6BgKQok,3,"Hardcore Spanish food, with flamenco show!!"
ChIJmYU0PW4mQg0RRuIe6BgKQok,1,Terrible
ChIJmYU0PW4mQg0RRuIe6BgKQok,5,This os amaizing
ChIJHZqc2HImQg0RHCFToIHlXqE,4,"Good food, nice friendly prompt service"
ChIJHZqc2HImQg0RHCFToIHlXqE,5,Nice place
ChIJHZqc2HImQg0RHCFToIHlXqE,5,"A small, homely and warm restaurant, with wonderful customer service, will make you feel at home; I had the opportunity to consume the Madrid stew with a good dessert; I recommend it

A small restaurant, homey and warm, with wonderful customer service, will make you feel at home;  I had the opportunity to consume the Madrid stew with a good dessert;  I recommend it"
ChIJHZqc2HImQg0RHCFToIHlXqE,4,"Are you cool with real food, slow food and various nonsense? Eye and roof with hanging gardens.

It's not your place.

Do you like to eat great food with good service, in a traditional atmosphere and at a good price?

Well you know. If you go, you will enjoy it."
ChIJHZqc2HImQg0RHCFToIHlXqE,5,"A great bar, good food and extraordinary service. It fits very well"
ChIJWU4qKj4mQg0RlgfzuuHckFQ,1,I didn't like the food here. The food was plain and simple. We doubted if it is from the market and just put it in the microwave before serving. Overall I couldn't eat the first meal. Not an ideal place for a good meal.
ChIJWU4qKj4mQg0RlgfzuuHckFQ,3,Fair option for a beer if you are in the area
ChIJWU4qKj4mQg0RlgfzuuHckFQ,5,"Nice place, good prices and friendly treatment. Site to discover...we will repeat. Good tapas. Good food. WE LIKE IT... They need to have some detail... a shot... something..."
ChIJWU4qKj4mQg0RlgfzuuHckFQ,5,"We go to breakfast almost every day because we are close to work and the waiter's service is always very good.

We had Spanish breakfast for ‚Ç¨4.5 that includes coffee, juice, omelette or eggs and ham with tomato and bread. Sometimes we also have the ham and tomato muffin for ‚Ç¨2.8.

They also have a covered terrace in front of the door.

In terms of accessibility, it is very good, you enter straight from the street and there is a bathroom on the same floor."
ChIJWU4qKj4mQg0RlgfzuuHckFQ,5,"My partner and I have been going down to drink
beer many times and the treatment towards him
client is excellent. Yesterday we had dinner
first time and the truth is that the experience
It was really satisfying. The food very
Good and as always the exquisite treatment.
Since the change of owners it has been one of the
best places in the area to have a drink and
have dinner. Not only the treatment towards us but
towards our pet, which is at first
who serve nothing with their pot of water
more arrive.
10/10 super delighted."
ChIJVUCiOZUnQg0Rgqcp0ZjvAOc,4,"Good Peruvian restaurant if you want to try chifa food (Peruvian Chinese food). On weekends is always full, it's better to reserve in advance. Tasty food and normal prices. Big dishes. I really like this place."
ChIJVUCiOZUnQg0Rgqcp0ZjvAOc,5,"Stumbled across this great find when the first two restaurants we were searching for were closed for vacation. Our waiter made great suggestions for our introduction to this cuisine. Food was delicious, and came out quickly even though they were quite busy. Very generous portions, and the price was very reasonable. Worth investigating if you're in this part of Madrid."
ChIJVUCiOZUnQg0Rgqcp0ZjvAOc,5,"Grear food, great taste, super cozy! The menu is super accessible budget wise. I totally recommend the spicy seafood soup, its stuff for the soul! La comida es super rica con un menu bastante accesible en cuestion de precio. La sopa de mariscos picante esta para morir, los arroces son riquisimos. Es un lugar que vale la pena frecuentar cada semana. I am totally going over every week just to check out the remainder of the menu. The place its a hidden jewel in Madrid's urban area of Usera"
ChIJVUCiOZUnQg0Rgqcp0ZjvAOc,3,"For those not familiar with Chifa food, its 100 years in the making when cantonese immigrants arrived to Peru and meshed and adapted the best of 2 worlds. Doromari does this well and covers some of the classics such as Chaufa (rice dish) and Tipa Kay (Chicken sweet n sour). Sizes are plentiful and the local cosy but not authentic."
ChIJVUCiOZUnQg0Rgqcp0ZjvAOc,5,Everything was delicious. The cake I has could have been a bit more moist.
ChIJ78kyLhMmQg0RcAvMZ76aZQY,5,"Homemade food with fresh ingredients and lots of flavors.
I visited this place twice and my experience was extremely positive. Everything I tried was delicious but I specifically recommend the noodles and the meatballs. For 15 ‚Ç¨ you can eat a four-dish meal, a piece of bread and a fruit juice.
The staff is very attentive and the place is clean.
I highly recommend this restaurant."
ChIJ78kyLhMmQg0RcAvMZ76aZQY,4,Ok food that is not to expensive. Good selection of hamburgers.
ChIJ78kyLhMmQg0RcAvMZ76aZQY,2,"4,90 ‚Ç¨ Euro for a plain yoghurt and a lukewarm black tea. Not especially good value for money. The place seems to popular for a quick lunch though. No Wifi."
ChIJ78kyLhMmQg0RcAvMZ76aZQY,4,Recently renovated. Delicious food. Good service. Prices went up but worth it.
ChIJ78kyLhMmQg0RcAvMZ76aZQY,4,It is good to first see the food and order. I like the concept. Prices are average.
ChIJGQqCohUmQg0R4ISTAty_Oac,5,"Whenever I go to Madrid I eat 99% of my dinners here. I highly recommend the Sopa Agripicante, Pollo Agridulce and Tofu. The people who work here are very nice. ‚ò∫Ô∏èü´∂üèª"
ChIJGQqCohUmQg0R4ISTAty_Oac,5,Tasty food and warm service! The owner of the shop speaks perfect English and Spanish. The environment is tranquil and clean.
ChIJGQqCohUmQg0R4ISTAty_Oac,5,"Great tasty food, quick service, polite staff. We were very happy with our food. Portions were filling and the taste was delicious."
ChIJGQqCohUmQg0R4ISTAty_Oac,5,Anytime I am in Madrid I always come back here . The food is amazing and they offer a great selection . The service is 100% and the place is spotless .
ChIJGQqCohUmQg0R4ISTAty_Oac,5,"Nice Chinese restaurant very close to the EasyHotel. Service was efficient and friendly. I had the roast duck and wonton soup, which was very nice for my final meal on my Spanish vacation."
ChIJjZ51BVUnQg0RaoVPPDhAMV0,5,"We were watching football last night and I only have good things to say, they made a reservation for a table for me over the phone and when we arrived we had one right in front of the TV. The staff is very friendly, they are very attentive to ensure that everything is to your liking, that you don't miss anything, they give you snacks, they serve you quickly... I haven't seen such good service in a bar for a long time.
Without a doubt highly recommended, the food is also very good and abundant, we will return!"
ChIJjZ51BVUnQg0RaoVPPDhAMV0,1,"As soon as we entered the music was loud, the bar was empty and we went to sit at a high table, when the waiter told us that everything was reserved: it wasn't even a gourmet restaurant! We were going with the intention of having a drink before going to dinner, so we planned to spend a maximum of 20 minutes in the bar, during that time no one came to occupy the table (a barrel with nothing on it). The waitress who served us did not have much desire to serve the public and did not even show the slightest smile, well, you can be polite without smiling, I don't ask for more. We paid 4.5 for each beer, slashed and on top of that cornered and poorly treated. I won't come back even if they pay me."
ChIJjZ51BVUnQg0RaoVPPDhAMV0,2,"The place is good to go see the Real Madrid games, it WAS our favorite, the food is good, but the MANAGER's attention is TERRIBLE, super selective, he serves his friends or acquaintances well, the others don't care, we had a reservation and he assigned us the worst table, even though we were the first customers to arrive, he made a thousand excuses for us. The worst thing is that he is the manager and should be the one who should give the best treatment to ALL customers. It would be good if they gave him a customer service class, so he can learn a little."
ChIJjZ51BVUnQg0RaoVPPDhAMV0,4,"Nice place. Friendly service, very cool place to have a drink. They serve food with the same menu as Artiro'S Restaurant.  We will come to eat another day. I leave photos. Mateo treated us very kindly."
ChIJjZ51BVUnQg0RaoVPPDhAMV0,4,"The music was very good until they played Spanish music, it was just my husband and I and I asked for disco music so we could continue dancing, they continued with Spanish music and we left"
ChIJYwRsdfcnQg0Ri50VAlSrvwA,4,Its ok‚Ä¶ nothing to highlight. Right for work lunch..
ChIJYwRsdfcnQg0Ri50VAlSrvwA,2,"The food in general was only acceptable for how expensive it is, but above all I would highlight the worrying experience we lived in terms of allergens. When asking if the brava sauce and other foods contained gluten, the person in charge did not know what gluten was and did not confirm it until we insisted that he please ask the kitchen. It seems essential to me that staff are well trained in this regard, especially considering that the letter suggests asking them about allergen concerns. I hope that the restaurant takes measures to improve this important point and becomes aware."
ChIJYwRsdfcnQg0Ri50VAlSrvwA,5,"A very cool place that offers innovative cuisine, egg tempura is a discovery that surprises with its ingenious flavor and texture, tapas with another concept that invite you to taste them. Miguel and Carlos are incredible people who leave you with the feeling of wanting to return."
ChIJYwRsdfcnQg0Ri50VAlSrvwA,1,"Tasteful and pleasant place but some of the staff with bad treatment. They have a drinks area with a DJ, we are just a group of 4 friends in the place having some beers and some drinks at 4.5 and 8 respectively, we have had 4 rounds and we are sitting quietly in the place listening to the music, we ask for some songs and they tell us no because they have to play music to everyone's taste. I remind him that there are only the 4 of us in the place and NO ONE ELSE, except a waitress and the DJ and he tells us no... It is not that difficult to please the customers nor is what is asked of them so exorbitant."
ChIJYwRsdfcnQg0Ri50VAlSrvwA,5,"A site with very good quality but with a service that leaves something to be desired. Has increased prices compared to the previous owner. The snack menu is less extensive than before. The meat, seafood and mixed boards were removed. The chopped grilled entrec√¥te was removed. Now to eat well you spend more. Added oriental food, pokeball etc. which is not bad.  The service was bad before. A shame about the service because the quality of the food is still good. You have to go slowly, especially in summer to have something on the terrace."
ChIJIVBZpbMnQg0RqjrEv_ypMGk,5,"I've already had lunch, brunch and snack at this place, and almost the same day, and I want to try dinner.
Great environment at the terrace, especially on summer evenings"
ChIJIVBZpbMnQg0RqjrEv_ypMGk,5,The best local place with great lomo alto!
ChIJIVBZpbMnQg0RqjrEv_ypMGk,1,"Terrible, oily food. Could barely stomach what was served."
ChIJIVBZpbMnQg0RqjrEv_ypMGk,3,Microwave food with little flavor.
ChIJIVBZpbMnQg0RqjrEv_ypMGk,4,Good food. Nice people.
ChIJbRri8HAnQg0ReJi58FwNYhY,5,"The ramen is delicious and the pork gyozas melted in your mouth. Super rich. My boy and I are big fans of Japanese food and this place is one of the best we have tried. Cooked by Japanese, you can tell that they put love into what they do. The most surprising thing is the desserts! They were incredible. We have tried the rice balls (ohanami) and the sesame ice cream. Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu again!!"
ChIJbRri8HAnQg0ReJi58FwNYhY,5,"Very very surprised. If you are looking for a place that serves ramen and you have come this far, come in.
The starters are spectacular and the ramen, the best I have had in Madrid.

The broth is incredible, tasty. The ajitama eggs have a lot of flavor and the pork... melts in your mouth.
Almost certainly you have not tried something like this in Madrid.

Desserts are a must. The sesame ice cream is delicious.

The place is not very big, you can tell that they have just opened because it still has the appearance of the previous place, but it is cozy.
They accompany the stay with a subtle Ghibli-style soundtrack.

It is run by a Japanese boy and girl. Both super nice, super attentive, super grateful.

We have left super happy and very surprised. We will return without hesitation."
ChIJbRri8HAnQg0ReJi58FwNYhY,5,"This new site is a success. We ordered several things to try, some takoyakis, pork gyozas, rice and ramen. Everything was great! We have been wanting to try more things, so we will definitely return. They have a terrace that is always appreciated now with the good weather (or if you bring your dog). I especially emphasize the professionalism of the treatment and attention of the two waitresses. In short, food of 10 with treatment of 10."
ChIJi4UuOGsmQg0RncpXTL-rcws,5,"Nice selection of food, very personally and friendly service. Highly recomended!"
ChIJi4UuOGsmQg0RncpXTL-rcws,5,"An amazing experience with amazing service, they treat you like family"
ChIJi4UuOGsmQg0RncpXTL-rcws,5,"BE Part of NY

ChIJi4UuOGsmQg0RncpXTL-rcws,5,Little Habana
ChIJi4UuOGsmQg0RncpXTL-rcws,4,"A surprise.
Excellent value for money. We ate the menu, it was Saturday, and it was very good.
Good attention.
A place to return to."
ChIJU_RYAcUnQg0Rht44lja2dts,5,It was so good! The food was delicious and inventive and rich and original and flavourful and there are so many nice things a can say about the love and heart that went into preparing those dishes. The calamari sandwich with this fresh citrus alioli in a brioche bun is something that I will crave to taste again very soon.
ChIJU_RYAcUnQg0Rht44lja2dts,5,We went here for dinner and ordered the most interesting version of tortilla de patata (which we enjoyed)! The place offers elaborated takes on some of the classic Spanish dishes.
ChIJU_RYAcUnQg0Rht44lja2dts,5,"Run by two brothers, In-Pulso is a casual but refined restaurant. Having opened in mid-2022, it has already earned a ""Solete"", the Repsol Guide's award for less formal places. The menu is pleasantly short, consisting of three individual appetizers, six dishes for sharing, and two desserts. Many of the plates are based in Madrid's culinary history and have a personal story behind them. There are some unusual, but delicious, combinations, like scallops with Brussel sprouts, hummus and ""cocido"" sauce. Our dinner was great from beginning to end. Highly recommended."
ChIJU_RYAcUnQg0Rht44lja2dts,5,"Out of the city centre but not far away, In-pulso is plenty of soul. Personal interpretation of traditional local gastronomy cooked by a chef  with long experience in reputed restaurants as  Ram√≥n Freixa (two Michelin stars) or Punto MX (one Michelin star)

Informal place and nice service.
Wine list is short and  eclectic with focus local wines"
ChIJU_RYAcUnQg0Rht44lja2dts,5,"A bit off the beaten path and totally worth it! Lovely service, delicious food, calm atmosphere. The lobster roll was top notch! (Better than ones I've had on Cape Cod.)"
ChIJB5jdedQnQg0RfRrUFTTugHc,5,Good service from Valeria üòäand Patri as usual. The Cajun ribs are excellent.
ChIJB5jdedQnQg0RfRrUFTTugHc,5,"Surprisingly amazing, the food was delicious and fast , the white and black cake was simply wonderful and on top of that the service was more than perfect, our waiter was super charming , keep it up guys , way to go üëè"
ChIJB5jdedQnQg0RfRrUFTTugHc,4,"Good burger and good fries. Also, conveniently located. The chocolate milkshake could use some more chocolate though."
ChIJB5jdedQnQg0RfRrUFTTugHc,5,"I propose the smash burger, it was juicy and tasty!"
ChIJB5jdedQnQg0RfRrUFTTugHc,5,Best ribs
ChIJ2TO3up8nQg0Rw9qKC_t6aEE,5,"This restaurant serves excellent italian cuisine in its purest traditional way. We ordered tagliatella Al pesto and Pizza 4 stagioni, they were delicious! And the Coffee Gustoso with trufles was out of this world ! Thanks for the great service as well"
ChIJ2TO3up8nQg0Rw9qKC_t6aEE,1,"If there is 0 stars i would put it! So i ordered one of the pasta ( tagliatelle alla marborana) and as i don‚Äôt eat meat i asked if it has meat and the waiter said no! I specifically asked like no cerdo no bacon and he said no! When he brought the plate, it was suspicious and i felt something wrong! I called the same waiter and asked again showing one piece of meat and i informed him that i cannot eat pork or any type if meat! And he kept confirming! Saying that this is ‚Äòtipo de champiniones‚Äô. I took a picture and sent to a friend! My friend confirmed it is pork. I asked for the bill! The plate was as it and the waiter didn‚Äôt even bother to tell me whats wrong or offer something else! Obviously never coming back again!"
ChIJ2TO3up8nQg0Rw9qKC_t6aEE,1,"After 45 minutes, having made a reservation 45 minutes ago.  We had to beg to get the appetizer, that was not coming.  Manager was Emilio.  And still have to wait 45 min for a pizza and an entecot (since they couldn‚Äôt make a regular meat dish on the menu.  Unless you have endless time, not recommended at all (note, the server was really nice, but that did not change receiving our food on time (surely not his fault).  Do not order the 7th cheese pizza, unless you want unmelted cheese    Disappointed completely!  Ps:   The manager came, said apologies, offered to give us next time the food on menu, surprinsely  not available, but did not even ask for a name for us.  Seemed typical excuse but won‚Äôt hold to it.  Pretty much dissapointing. You might as well walk onto block,  there are PLENTY restaurants that will treat you as you deserve, not like you have to thank them to treat you average, as in Tagliatella"
ChIJ2TO3up8nQg0Rw9qKC_t6aEE,3,"Overall the food here was quite good, however I consider the prices to be extortionate for what is basic Italian food."
ChIJ2TO3up8nQg0Rw9qKC_t6aEE,3,Food is not particularly remarkable. I had a salami and mascarpone pasta that was a little overcooked and had literally only two pieces of salami.
ChIJs_y9-EsnQg0RU94SHcDNorg,5,"Very nice place. The staff was lovely and everything was delicious without being expensive. Highly recommended.

Also, a good variety of specifically vegan options."
ChIJs_y9-EsnQg0RU94SHcDNorg,1,"l tried it two times. Low quality food, miserable environment, expensive"
ChIJs_y9-EsnQg0RU94SHcDNorg,5,good!
ChIJs_y9-EsnQg0RU94SHcDNorg,4,"Four of us went for dinner on a Friday and the place was not very busy. The service was good and the food was all very delicious. We ordered: miso soup, meat and kale gyoza, Teriyaki chicken, Norwegian mix combo (20 pieces), double tuna and three desserts. Everything came out to ‚Ç¨19 per person. Highly recommended because everything felt fresh and freshly prepared. It is true that when we were there it looked like it was just another takeaway restaurant. But we have had a good experience."
ChIJs_y9-EsnQg0RU94SHcDNorg,5,"Here's a review you can post on Google:

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

""The food was very good, with gluten-free menu options, which is a great detail. The service was excellent, and Agna took great care of us, very attentive and friendly at all times. Without a doubt, a place we will return to. Recommended!""

My daughter loved your braid üòÖ"
ChIJt2iU9cknQg0RKXbT4BUxfiw,4,If you want a vegan options you just need to ask. Quick and tasty.
ChIJt2iU9cknQg0RKXbT4BUxfiw,5,"Very good for noodles and wok, the venue is nice and clean, take away is served very fast and the pricing is excellent value for money. The teriyaki is very tasty and the special box and the daily menu are really worth it. One of my favourite restaurants in the area. Many of my friends tried it and like it too."
ChIJt2iU9cknQg0RKXbT4BUxfiw,5,The food is good and the price is pretty reasonable. Also the restaurant is very clean and neat.
ChIJt2iU9cknQg0RKXbT4BUxfiw,5,Nice ‚Äúbuild it yourself‚Äù noodle place. A lot of options and reasonable price. Portions are very big
ChIJt2iU9cknQg0RKXbT4BUxfiw,5,Very delicious and quick !
ChIJOXwH6mAnQg0R92SSf-dlves,1,"I got food poisoning after this visit, I hadn't eaten anything else that day that could give me food poisoning, I would advise against visiting this KFC"
ChIJOXwH6mAnQg0R92SSf-dlves,5,Top
ChIJOXwH6mAnQg0R92SSf-dlves,5,Deli
ChIJOXwH6mAnQg0R92SSf-dlves,2,"The truth is that I expected more from such a ""central"" place. I ordered chicken strips and they are very dry... It means that they have been cooking for more than 1 or 2 hours and it shouldn't be like that... In the photo you can see that they don't have the two batters that they should have and they only have 1 (it's more noticeable in the original strips) and I haven't come at an hour too late for them to not cook a new batch either.

Apart from the service, both the manager and the girl at the counter with long faces do not look at you when you ask for things and they look at you with a bad face if you ask for something that they themselves forgot. I don't think I'll come to this KFC again."
ChIJOXwH6mAnQg0R92SSf-dlves,1,"Horrible service and bad attention from the receptionist, she is already an old lady, she should be a little more friendly with clients. Here we are not asking for anything for free."
ChIJHUYiHqUpQg0RDeY-P-H0cf0,5,"It was late and I had a bus to catch - this was such a great option being right next to the bus station.

The server who took care of me was excellent, diligent and very nice! He helped me swiftly and the burger came out quick and perfect! I got it to go, to eat at the station, and it was so fast!

The burger was amazing! I'm glad smash burgers are trending in Madrid like crazy right now, this one was so so good. I highly recommend! Also you can choose to make the party how you like, thick and juicy or thin and smashed. It's a great idea and everyone can get a burger exactly how they prefer. Thank you!"
ChIJHUYiHqUpQg0RDeY-P-H0cf0,5,"A very lovely place with friendly and gentle workers. Unless I misremember, a worker named Adrian helped us and gave every detail about hamburgers, their ingredients and cooking/broling ways. When I arrived at the Cesar's, I was srarving for more than 8 hours. I was not capable of reasoning. By the help of Adrian, we had a chance to try mouth-watering hamburgers. Thank you so much guys."
ChIJHUYiHqUpQg0RDeY-P-H0cf0,5,Ok I ordered what I thought was medium rare. I should have asked some clarifying questions. The burger was rare. Although I felt bad asking I really wanted to enjoy my meal. The chef was so kind and they brought me a fresh burger ‚Äúmash‚Äù style and was cooked perfectly. I will return.
ChIJHUYiHqUpQg0RDeY-P-H0cf0,5,Cesar's Burguer is a top notch burger joint. We had the Clasica tripple patty cooked rare as it was a smashed patty and was perfectly cooked. Super tasty and mouth watering. The fries were also really good and one side was enough for the two of us.
ChIJHUYiHqUpQg0RDeY-P-H0cf0,5,"Cool atmosphere and great burgers! Interesting that they have two ways of making your burger, either almost rare (rojo rojo) or basically fully we‚Äôll done, no in between. Be mindful of that when ordering, overall though great service and cool place to stop for a bite!"
ChIJgTu2lBgnQg0RoVj5Tkagcyg,1,"Ordered Kungpao chicken from Ubereats.
The order was supposed to reach within 20-40 mins but took 1 hour. The kungpao chicken was the worst version I have ever tasted in my travels across 3 continents - it is supposed to be flavourful with chili and cashew.
All I got was some bland soggy chicken and vegetables, no chilli,  in a very very very watery sauce,
The 4.6 stars on Uber eats are a sham."
ChIJgTu2lBgnQg0RoVj5Tkagcyg,5,Amazing RAMEN! Really kind employees and good price!
ChIJgTu2lBgnQg0RoVj5Tkagcyg,5,Very attentive staff.
ChIJgTu2lBgnQg0RoVj5Tkagcyg,1,"Terrible food, there is no food that can be eaten there, not ramen, rice or sushi, nothing at all. (Price‚â†Quality)
The good thing is the treatment of the workers and nothing more and the atmosphere, but the meals have a lot to be desired."
ChIJgTu2lBgnQg0RoVj5Tkagcyg,4,"The food was very good, but the toilet flush was spectacular.
Quality-price of ten."
ChIJ022GxBQmQg0R6sSCXcwiJaE,3,"Good for a quick bite and keep going. Extensive list of montaditos, a small piece of good baguette topped with whatever you pick from the 100 (or about) options on the list. Good coffeeg, affordable prices.
It's a franchise, get in any you ran into."
ChIJ022GxBQmQg0R6sSCXcwiJaE,5,Nice service nice food but I didn't like one thing how beggar's enter inside the restaurant it looks so bad
ChIJ022GxBQmQg0R6sSCXcwiJaE,4,"If you are going for no frills and cheap option.This is the one you will not want to miss.
Hot dog for E$1 and coffee for E$1.30
Beer for E$1.50

There is outdoor seating and it is near station."
ChIJ022GxBQmQg0R6sSCXcwiJaE,5,great quick spot for a fast meal and cheap

ChIJCznYrIYnQg0RR36OQ9NqsKk,5,"I have been carrying my Christmas basket for several years and it never disappoints. Not only is the cut of both the ham and the rest of the sausage perfect, but the details are taken care of. Super recommended"
ChIJCznYrIYnQg0RR36OQ9NqsKk,5,"David is an absolute professional. They take care of everything from the first detail to the last, advising and informing at all times of the process, as well as being competitive and fast. A true gem."
ChIJCznYrIYnQg0RR36OQ9NqsKk,5,"David is a professional who provides impeccable service while being both nice and approachable. The ham is not only perfectly cut, but it gives a fantastic presentation to give as a gift or take to events. Finally, comment that it adapted to my needs for delivery.
In short, we have been very happy, we will use their services again and we highly recommend them."
ChIJCznYrIYnQg0RR36OQ9NqsKk,5,"Thank you very much David, a true cutting professional. He has made an impeccable cut and presentation (fast and with maximum quality). The treatment has been unbeatable, very friendly at all times.... 100% recommended."
ChIJCznYrIYnQg0RR36OQ9NqsKk,5,"Good professional. Excellent treatment and very detailed. I have had him at a couple of events and he has not failed, everyone has been delighted. He has also cut several hams for the family and the presentation and packaging is fantastic. He also advises you to prepare the trays so that when you consume it it is almost freshly cut."
ChIJWZC0XUInQg0Rpag4jgI0O00,4,"Came here with a tour group.  Overall it was a good experience, with one exception.  The flamenco show was fantastic, truly a 5 star experience. I had the fish entree, which was fine, nothing outstanding but acceptable.  My wife had the beef and it was easily the worst piece of meat either of us had in our entire lives.  Tougher than shoe leather and flavorless.  She could only get one bite into her stomach.  Several other people at our table had the same reaction to their beef.  The rest of the food was fine, and the service was good."
ChIJWZC0XUInQg0Rpag4jgI0O00,5,"Nice experience. The Tablao Flamenco was great. Also the place allows great views of the show. The food was good, only some people got their plate cold. So far, good."
ChIJWZC0XUInQg0Rpag4jgI0O00,5,"Dear readers, we were advised to check out this place by my friend, who is from Madrid, and I‚Äôm so glad we listened‚Ä¶we booked online for the VIP table‚Ä¶we didn‚Äôt realize we were going to be front row and center‚Ä¶it was very exciting. It included a small bottle of champagne, which was a nice addition. The place was packed, not an empty seat in the room. We were a bit on the late side, try to get there early, so you finish dinner before the show starts. We were honestly walking in with low expectations, not sure why, but let me tell you, everything far exceeded our expectations. The service was excellent, the food was fantastic‚Ä¶my husband said the steak was one of the best he has ever had. My risotto was beyond delicious. The boys enjoyed their meals as well. Then the performance started, I was so immersed by the music, the emotions, the atmosphere‚Ä¶it is something you have to experience‚Ä¶after it was over the dj played music and people started dancing. It was a spectacular evening, I was worried my boys may not have appreciated it, but they enjoyed it too. We had to Uber back since it‚Äôs not in a very busy area."
ChIJWZC0XUInQg0Rpag4jgI0O00,5,"Beautiful location and excellent flamenco performance. The singers (cantaores) and the dancers (bailaores) were equally good, showing so much passion and emotion for what they did.

We purchased a Groupon and got an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  For appetizer, we got croquetas de pulpo and croquetas de Jamon. The croquetas de pulpo were okay, nothing to rave about to the croquetas de Jamon were excellent.  For the entrees, we got steak and fish bites both were very tasty.

Food came out first and then the show started at 10 pm and lasted an hour."
ChIJWZC0XUInQg0Rpag4jgI0O00,1,"AVOID THIS PLACE.

If i could hive 0 stars i would. I have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant before. The employees there were rude, dismissive and literally went out of their way to ignore us. I asked for a glass of just water, and the guy just looked at me like i had 3 heads. Apparently no one there speaks any English which I found odd since they spoke English fine. It felt like they were using it as an excuse to pretend not to understand us when we complained about the lack of actual food.

We paid over ¬£74 total for two people for a flamenco show and tapas dinner with drinks. What we got was one drink and a small sorry plate of some cheese and two small croquettes to eat between the two of us. Literally just one small piece each. This plate in the image was for between two of us for the whole night, and to get actual food was extra cost. To clarify, the plate was that empty when we got it. We only ate the croquettes and one small breadstick each. The cheapest thing on the menu was ‚Ç¨16. We asked if we would get actual tapas and they said this plate was it. We are fighting for a refund as this is just outright false advertising. The service was awful and despite all the other tables having drinks and food, we were ignored and eventually left before the show to go somewhere to get some actual food. Avoid this place, it's literally a scam for foreigners. If you are Spanish they treat you really well. We saw Spanish groups around us getting proper food and service and we had to go up and try to find someone just to talk to someone as they avoided us constantly.

We are still fighting to get a refund, we couldn't even stay for another 2 hours for the flamenco show as we were so hungry, the people by the door literally didn't even acknowledge us as we left, even though we tried to make some sort of eye contact to explain that we were leaving and not returning.

I'm high masking autistic and honestly, the whole thing was so stressful and disappointing. The restaurant is refusing a refund saying a refund would impact their business, which I don't believe for a second unless this happens regularly, in which case they shouldn't be allowed to take money for this scam anyway."
ChIJi-BlNhMmQg0RVPWL2_lCboo,2,"I ordered the black rice with seafood, calamari, and flan. The tastiest was the flan. The black rice was ok. The calamari was very bland and a little tough."

Very varied products and at a good price.
The best of all the staff, very professional, super attentive, friendly. 100% recommended."
ChIJi-BlNhMmQg0RVPWL2_lCboo,1,"Menu of the day very limited and low quality for a price of ‚Ç¨13.5. The service leaves a lot to be desired, the waiter has confronted us by becoming aggressive when asking for the split bill."
ChIJRZKsMBMmQg0RYd8fVzU6Lxk,2,"We had lunch here yesterday and ordered the beef stew and paella Valenciana. We were told that the arroz meal would take about 25 minutes to prepare. Cut to 30 minutes after, we were served the beef stew first. It was good. Then a waiter told us that we need to wait an extra 25 minutes more since their oven or something wasn‚Äôt working. We had to cancel it.

ChIJl_hffv8nQg0Rtjl89S_DFOs,5,"Super cute place where Japanese food such as Takoyakis, Dorayakis, etc. are imported directly from Japan, and then the pancakes and sushi are made fresh on the premises, highly recommended."
ChIJl_hffv8nQg0Rtjl89S_DFOs,5,"EXCELLENT SERVICE. You can tell that the owner has lived in Japan since everything he makes, in terms of form and ingredients, is from brands from there.  Very kind and helpful, he even poured me more than could fit in the glass of the jar where he made it. Highly recommended"
ChIJJ_7uw-8nQg0Rad6gU9et0Bk,5,"The best paella ever! Many choices with fresh ingredients, you can order in advance and get your order. Take away only. I highly recommend!"
ChIJJ_7uw-8nQg0Rad6gU9et0Bk,4,"Very good rice dishes prepared in this restaurant.
In this case we ordered the rice dishes to take away and I have to say that they were delicious.
We opted for Valencian paella and black rice and both were 10.
Highly recommended and very good value for money."
ChIJJ_7uw-8nQg0Rad6gU9et0Bk,4,"Great rice. Very nice place with very delicious rice at a very good price. I've always gone to eat there on their terrace but it seems like they sell a lot of takeout. And it is a good idea to buy to eat at home.
There is delicious vegetarian paella.
It is important to reserve to go eat there.
Recommended. It is not very close to any subway. But you can walk from Legazpi and it is about 7 minutes walk. If you go by car, it is not difficult to park there.
Very close to the tender Galv√°n."
ChIJJ_7uw-8nQg0Rad6gU9et0Bk,4,"Good rice, although not extraordinary, you can notice the flavor of the ingredients it contains, it has a lot of seafood and fish (a banda) at good prices. For my taste, the rice is a bit overcooked.

For dessert they only have torrija, apparently made of brioche and with a little dulce de leche, it is good but it could be better with a little more moisture in the bread, it was a bit dry.

For starters they give you some toast with tuna and chopped tomato, and at the end they offer you some house shots that are quite generous.

Good place to go eat rice."
ChIJJ_7uw-8nQg0Rad6gU9et0Bk,5,"A new takeaway rice place in the Los Puertos area. We just ""released"" it by ordering a Valencian paella and I must say that it was delicious. Now we'll have to try the others! A great acquisition for the neighborhood. Highly recommended (yes, it is better to call before to place the order). Welcome!"

Without a doubt a place to go to eat in Vallekas.
So it is a pleasure to go out to eat. The kindness of the owners, as well as that of their employees, is above all.
Keep going like this, don't change."
ChIJUZL0UfgnQg0R27ewbVBVb8E,5,"We loved the food, it really tastes like home food, a ten to the cook, everything was really delicious.
We ate seafood pasta, smoked salmon salad, lamb stew and Galician-style octopus, a delight.
Very cheap for the quality they have.
Restaurant staff very nice

101% recommended. We love the whole family."
ChIJcX6vaUMmQg0RaOcZ6VtscPI,4,"El Puerto Restaurant, where you can enjoy good, quality food, surrounded by a good atmosphere. The treatment of the staff was quite good and attentive at all times. As for the product, very good quality/price ratio.

ChIJcX6vaUMmQg0RaOcZ6VtscPI,2,"It's the bar downstairs from the house and you can drink the beers in peace, but it seems that it costs them money to provide appetizers, if you're lucky they'll give you some kikos, and if they give you some frozen nuggets without frying, you'll be in for a treat. The only good thing, the Chinese food cuisine."
ChIJcX6vaUMmQg0RaOcZ6VtscPI,4,"I don't know what's going on but it's taking a long time to make a paella.
The paella has arrived and I thought it was better than the one my grandmother made in Cartagena. Very delicious and we have eaten three of the two so it's great"

ChIJK6kns5UnQg0R0xvh18Dv4cc,1,"I ordered through Glovo at ‚ÄúThe Real Kebab‚Äù and I received different orders. That is to say, I ordered potatoes with chegar and they brought me normal potatoes (taking into account that the ones I ordered are even more expensive) then I asked for a classic kebab and what I received was one with some kind of croquettes inside which, in addition to being bad, was also not bad. had asked.

Very upset and disappointed with the order, this is the first time this has happened to me after ordering from a balloon so many times.
0 recommended, they should be ashamed that all the products that arrive are different and even cheaper than the money that has been spent.

As if that were not enough, when I went to try the Kebab I found a hair."
ChIJK6kns5UnQg0R0xvh18Dv4cc,1,"I ordered a breakfast box for Mother's Day at Boxes & Gelatos by Sweet Teo, through Glovo, and it never arrived.

After an hour delay, it was impossible to contact them to find out the status of the order. Neither from me, nor from Glovo.

I had to cancel the order."
ChIJK6kns5UnQg0R0xvh18Dv4cc,1,"I ordered a burrito through glovo and the beans were in bad condition, the churros harder than a stone. The poorly fried teque√±os raw, a complete disaster, very bad, I do not recommend it in life. ‚Ç¨45 lost. POSTSCRIPT THE COCACOLA WAS GOOD."
ChIJK6kns5UnQg0R0xvh18Dv4cc,1,"The order is more than 55 minutes late. In addition, the place does not respond by message or phone. They won't even let me cancel the order. He tells me ‚Äúgarlic and water.‚Äù NUNCA MAIS and Glovo fatal for not taking responsibility"
ChIJK6kns5UnQg0R0xvh18Dv4cc,1,"I ordered a smoothie and it came slushy when as far as I know, smoothies are not slushy and on top of that it didn't taste like anything, it tasted like milk and that's it, it was supposed to taste like banana and apple, if it's not going to taste like anything don't put the option to create your own smoothie because it's not real. On top of that, I called the restaurant and they didn't offer me any solution..."

ChIJyW-ia5onQg0RLrUdnMamnfc,1,"The waiter was incredibly rude:
- Interrupted me ordering something else by asking ""coffee?""
- Didn't understand when I asked for coffee to go (ended up bringing 3 drinks for the two of us)
- Asked me ""do you speak English?"" after I took one second to think
- Asked me whether I wanted ham OR cheese in a ham & cheese toast (that we successfully ordered a day ago with a different waiter), and ended up bringing jamon
- Asked what kind of fresh fruit we wanted, and when I asked my wife about it, he overheard me saying –¥—ã–Ω—è (melon, which they did serve), and interrupted her to tell us they didn't serve pi√±a"

Overall very satisfied ! And the location - right next to the bus / train station - is definitely convenient."
ChIJFUvr_P8nQg0RPCY2xt-N2Xg,5,The poke tastes super yummy. I ordered Salmon on Fire with quinoa. The staffs are lovely and willing to help me select my bowl.

ChIJuWwUmhgnQg0RcotfY6g-44o,5,"Very good service, the hot dog is very small for the price, but it is well made and has good flavor. The Wok Box menu is also good, it comes on a plate, with potatoes and a drink of your choice. It's good and with good flavor, it's worth coming.  Just a little expensive.

ChIJtR6kN3AmQg0Rff_0WJLstDU,1,"It was disappointing, my cousins ‚Äã‚Äãadvised me.
I ordered a few things, such as on a Friday so that everything would be freshly done on Sunday to bring it fresh to Madrid, a disappointment.
Buy vast to bring to Madrid.
There were the hard packed donuts that had expired for 4 months and had a bad taste, one of the large jam donuts that was also hard, a half dozen of the large hard muffins, while the half dozen flowers were good.
Response from the person who answered the phone, that nothing was happening because with the expired date it was not important that they could be eaten, when in an establishment you cannot sell expired foods......
But it's okay not to go back and there to each one. If the guide becomes ill, the complaints will fall."
ChIJtR6kN3AmQg0Rff_0WJLstDU,5,This terrace is always great. The food has never disappointed me and it is great in the sun. The attention is also very good. And very reasonable prices.
ChIJtR6kN3AmQg0Rff_0WJLstDU,5,"A typical place in the neighborhood, I had always gone to the bar next door but the other day there was no room and we ended up here.

We were surprised by the good treatment they gave us and the amount of tapas they gave you.

We also ordered several portions, which were very generous and at a fairly affordable price. Highly recommended if you live in the area."
ChIJtR6kN3AmQg0Rff_0WJLstDU,1,"Very bad we ordered a chicharr√≥n with patac√≥n and nothing to do with the photo on the menu, they were re fried and tasted like burnt oil, too greasy, we told the waiter and he said that they were brown and that's why they were that greasy."

I tied it up like a burrito, but overall it was good, for ‚Ç¨3 you'll kill your hunger and that's it. If you tell me if I recommend it, then yes. Just the kebab another day I will try the rest."
ChIJvTVYNB0nQg0R5DwWeLk-x7Y,3,"It is a restaurant with a good location.
The place is clean and the staff is nice, helpful, they have Indian food and Kebab, not bad but too many species for our taste.
The complicated thing is parking in an area with narrow streets and car traffic."
ChIJ7y_XI18nQg0RkmzEx_mH0JY,5,"Cute, cosy restaurant with a diverse menu. It's hard to find a restaurant which does everything very well, so this one's precious. Good breakfast options, I recommend the croissant - very fluffy and fresh, and the berry smoothie. Their house sandwich, tortilla, fried mushroom, and wines are delicious. 10/10 service, they make you feel at home."
ChIJ7y_XI18nQg0RkmzEx_mH0JY,5,"Excellent food but, without a doubt, better service.
Delicious and very generous dishes, with a very careful presentation.
We have been many times and we will return many more to try all that careful menu and to share good moments with the good people who run it and who serve you and make you feel at home."
ChIJ7y_XI18nQg0RkmzEx_mH0JY,5,"Super cozy, I love the decoration it has, I have eaten here quite a few times, quite generous portions and everyone I have seen is better, super delicious salads, delicious puff burgers, I love their squid sandwiches and the rejos hahahaha it's all a sin, but you can't stop trying the tudanca beef, please, what a flavor, I really recommend a must-see, the treatment of the incredible staff makes you feel at home, if not for I would say that the meat they have is the best, but even with excellent service, their products are even better. Stop by and tell me, I will continue consuming there because I love it."
ChIJ7y_XI18nQg0RkmzEx_mH0JY,4,"Magnificent lebaniego and mountain stew to lick your fingers. You have to be aware of when they schedule them because they don't always have them.

The Cabrales potatoes, however, were not made with Cabrales, I think another cheese, and they were hard the day we tried them, a mistake.

The service is very friendly and they have a complimentary coffee liqueur creamer."
ChIJ7y_XI18nQg0RkmzEx_mH0JY,5,"We went yesterday for the first time and the portions are generous and delicious. The chopitos with a very soft batter and the grilled ear very well done.
The rice pudding and the cheesecake were a notable high.
The place is beautiful and the waiters are very friendly.
We will return for sure."
ChIJmVFW3ZUnQg0R_Wn-vpvOEjE,5,"One of my fondest memories when living in Spain was going to El Tigre as a pre pregame to drink and eat before going home to get ready and properly get ready for the night.
A MUST GO with your friends or family. Pay an expensive price for a big mojito, sangria, or beer then receive many different tapas. Tip the person a 10+ euros when you get your drinks and they will give you better service and good tapas."
ChIJmVFW3ZUnQg0R_Wn-vpvOEjE,2,"Awful food, smelly chicken and bad cooked meat. (But cheap).

The place is dirty, napkins are on the floor, it's noisy as well.

Good place to drink, but not for eating."

ChIJmVFW3ZUnQg0R_Wn-vpvOEjE,4,"It is a great bar to go for tapas with friends, we were 4 people and we paid ‚Ç¨18. I think it's an excellent price considering that the tapas are huge and don't taste bad at all, in the end for that price you eat very well and drink. It's always full so it can't be very clean but there are always people sweeping or cleaning up the area, and the waiters are always on top of everything. I really liked it a lot, I would go again without a doubt."
ChIJmVFW3ZUnQg0R_Wn-vpvOEjE,5,"We went for a drink on the recommendation of a friend and the truth is that I was amazed. There were 5 of us, we paid ‚Ç¨30 for two Coca-Colas, a jug of beer and two jugs of red wine. The amount of food is incredible. I will return for sure"
ChIJ7-kz07snQg0R1E-jnoNCTTk,5,"The food is very good, the closest thing to my Peru. Excellent service, the waitress Angiela is always available for a customer's needs, fast and friendly.
It is a nice environment to go with family, friends or alone. 10/10 in everything.
I didn't leave any of the dish I ordered and it's huge. ü§§ü§£"
ChIJ7-kz07snQg0R1E-jnoNCTTk,5,"We discovered this restaurant next to our house and we loved it. We had a trio of ceviche, seafood chaufa and fish chicharr√≥n for dinner. We liked it a lot, especially the ceviche. Good quantities.
The service was very friendly and recommended and explained the dishes to us. We ordered chicha to drink which was very delicious and refreshing.
To finish with something sweet, a tres leches cake that was delicious.
We will return without a doubt. üòÉ"
ChIJ7-kz07snQg0R1E-jnoNCTTk,5,"From the moment we called they were charming, very good service, super attentive and friendly. If you want to eat well and good food I recommend this place without a doubt. By the way, we loved the ceviche and the dessert, not to mention!!!"
ChIJ7-kz07snQg0R1E-jnoNCTTk,5,"We came to Embarcadero Gastrobar for dinner and we tried the marine trio and a causa acevichada. We left very happy to discover a charming place, spectacular food and very good service. We recommend it, we will return soon!"
ChIJ7-kz07snQg0R1E-jnoNCTTk,5,"Everything was super delicious despite the time we came, the truth is that they are very friendly and there is a good atmosphere both at work and with customer service 10/10 I highly recommend it"
ChIJkxn8bwAnQg0RJ8-bKTZhbwo,5,I came to Halal Friends for lunch and it was great. I honestly have no complaints. The staff was very attentive and the quality of the food was top notch. Chicken tenders were crunchy with the perfect batter to chicken ratio. Piri piri wings were seasoned perfectly and had a lovely char. Fries were crispy and hot. Burgers were juicy with a generous portion of meat. Additionally the place itself is very clean. Definitely my new favorite fast food place in Madrid.
ChIJkxn8bwAnQg0RJ8-bKTZhbwo,5,"I had both their smash burger and chicken burger, both were excellent! This place is so good, I can't wait to visit Madrid again just to have those burgers. Also Boycott friendly so I'd give them 6 stars"
ChIJkxn8bwAnQg0RJ8-bKTZhbwo,5,"One of the best burgers in Madrid! Fresh, juicy, and even my picky-eater son loved it. We were warmly welcomed by Sayed, who provided amazing service. Definitely planning to go back!"
ChIJkxn8bwAnQg0RJ8-bKTZhbwo,5,"We ordered the peri peri wings, a chickens sandwich, and the California coolness burger. Everything was cooked well and tasted delicious. The restaurant itself is very well kept and clean. The staff was nice."

ChIJ44zLJHEmQg0R6CY-BydUVQM,5,"Casa Doli is a place full of charm, ideal to enjoy a good meal and unwind with colleagues. Located in the heart of Vallecas, this restaurant stands out for the exceptional treatment of its team. The very friendly waiters make the experience even better.

We tried the menu of the day and each dish was a true success:
ü•ó **Russian salad:** A well-made classic, tasty and creamy!
üçù **Spaghetti with Bolognese sauce:** With just the right touch of flavor and an impeccable texture.
üçó **Garlic Chicken:** Juicy and perfectly seasoned.
üêü **Andalusian hake:** Crispy and full of flavor, as it should be.
üç∞ **Rice pudding cake:** A sweet and delicious ending that left us wanting to repeat.

All this accompanied by our favorite Madrid beer, **Mahou**, which never fails to complete a good meal.

If you are in Vallecas, Casa Doli is the perfect place to enjoy good food and a cozy atmosphere. Highly recommended! üçΩÔ∏èüçª"
ChIJ44zLJHEmQg0R6CY-BydUVQM,1,"Expensive place with unprofessional and slow service. Seeing the man with white hair and glasses remove the clean glasses from your table by putting his fingers inside them was the most unpleasant thing I have ever seen in hospitality. Twice they brought us dishes that were not ours.  I ask the waitress how much the steak weighs and she tells me that it's about 900 grams and it stays at 300 by removing the bone, meaning 70 euros for a 600 gram piece of bone because you're going to eat just 300.... The torreznos are not expensive because they're not from Soria.  26 euros for 4 suckling pig chops... 30 euros costs me about 15 euros at the butcher shop and suckling pig. Cod trunk 26 euros with some canned peppers..... The food was good but not worth the 200 euros on the bill. I won't fix it nor will I go back."
ChIJ44zLJHEmQg0R6CY-BydUVQM,4,"The food is very good and of high quality, as is the staff, who is very attentive. The only drawback I have is that the menu is somewhat scarce in terms of main dishes and some are quite expensive for the quantity they bring, such as the sea bass."
ChIJSae_aQsmQg0RRf2B0eIilQw,5,"the best restaurant in the neighbourhood. The quality is great and the prices are very Cheap. With 15 euros/ person you can have a great meal (beef) and a beer. Oh, i forgot, the desert is made by them and is better than what i ate in the Center of Madrid  at the bakery."
ChIJSae_aQsmQg0RRf2B0eIilQw,5,One of our highlights in Madrid. We ordered a 0.5kg beef and it was so tasty and tender! We also ordered chorizo as appetizer and was good too. Highly recommended. Attentive and friendly staff!
ChIJSae_aQsmQg0RRf2B0eIilQw,5,"Best restaurant in Madrid, great steak, amazing and patient waiters and great prices. It is located in a neighborhood that is not as hectic as other parts of the city, the atmosphere is great and clean. The chef was very accommodating and skilled."
ChIJSae_aQsmQg0RRf2B0eIilQw,4,Good place from which you will not go out hungry. You can choose plate from menu which normally is for more people or order a plate just for one person. The quality and plates are really good. Everything was fresh and tasty. You are all the time attended by waiters. I recommend to order menu in which you have a dessert or coffee included.
ChIJSae_aQsmQg0RRf2B0eIilQw,4,Fantastic meal with quality staff. Atmosphere is really pleasant. Found this one at the end of our stay which is a great shame as i would gladly eat here everyday.  Love it love it love it........
ChIJC51JVQomQg0R--hfb30bMTM,5,Really enjoyed our meal here and the service was great too. Had the seafood platter for 2 and honestly was enough for 3 or 4 people! We enjoyed the wine selection a little bit too much ending with a dessert wine which was out of this world. Great location right on the ocean.
ChIJC51JVQomQg0R--hfb30bMTM,5,Great food and great service!
ChIJC51JVQomQg0R--hfb30bMTM,5,"Excellent quality price and quantity. We had a feast, we got the 3 persons seafood. It consisted of chipirones, octopus, big tray of shrimps, langostinos, navajas. At the end they brought us the cow filets. The meat was also tender and medium done. We added the clamps on top and they were delicious. The sauce was amazing. With the menu we had beer jar and sangria . You can change some of the fishes or drinks if you prefer others."
ChIJC51JVQomQg0R--hfb30bMTM,1,"Reasonable food like in other bukhari restaurants
Fish is served with either black or while rice
I got hamor fish for 60 SR / Kg"
ChIJC51JVQomQg0R--hfb30bMTM,5,"Incredible food, friendly service. If you are searching for great tapas, this is the place to come."
ChIJ7SHUr3QmQg0RPz8JmvKM_KA,5,"This was a very nice surprise. The food was fantastic and it came fast although there were many guests. Very nice and competent staff. This is not a place that most tourists will find, but it is genuine Spanish food for the locals. Definitely worth taking a detour to the hood. Very decent prices compared to quality.
(Tip to owner: play classic Spanish music instead.)"
ChIJ7SHUr3QmQg0RPz8JmvKM_KA,5,It was perfect. Food was amazing. Too bad we lost our collegue in the bathroom maze.
ChIJ7SHUr3QmQg0RPz8JmvKM_KA,5,"Delicious food, simply delicious.  Unfortunately the service didn‚Äôt speak English but it was fairly easily to order with a little help of an English version of the menu."
ChIJ7SHUr3QmQg0RPz8JmvKM_KA,5,Head down to the restaurant for a great variety of dishes and excellent taste. The service is great too
ChIJ7SHUr3QmQg0RPz8JmvKM_KA,5,"Hard to find places like these still in Madrid. Authentic ""cerveceria"" excellent beer, Vermouth and don't forget to ask for a ""chupito"" at the end of a coffee liquor, soooo good!
The food is also excellent! If you choose to sit down for a proper meal call in advance cause it's busy (weekends). Hard to find parking, you might need to walk but it's worthwhile!"
ChIJFUwC1N8lQg0RTzD-Qa856W8,1,"Worst dominos ever, the deliverer guy didn't come and they swore on us and even dared to ask us to pay another time because ""we were not there"". Don't command there. Commanded on Uber eat."
ChIJFUwC1N8lQg0RTzD-Qa856W8,4,Customer attention lacks frequently. Phones are always busy and at times workers are saturated... Pizzas good though!
ChIJFUwC1N8lQg0RTzD-Qa856W8,1,"I ordered a vegetarian pizza because I don't eat meat. 10 min later I opened it.. There was chorizo, beef and ham in it. And hairs! This is nonsense!!!!"
ChIJFUwC1N8lQg0RTzD-Qa856W8,3,Great fresh pizza if you're on a pinch.

ChIJ-Yaa93QmQg0R55nqUW1oPzM,1,Worst pizza I‚Äôve ever had. The cheese is disgusting and like silicone. The vegetables tasted like rubber. The tomato sauce was watery. The meat was worse than Taco Bell meat. The pizza didn‚Äôt even hold well together. When I would pick up a slice the ingredients would fall off instantly. The taste was terrible and I regret ever setting foot in that place. Do your body justice and avoid this place. Shame on telepizza for serving this filth. I wish google would let me put zero stars.
ChIJ-Yaa93QmQg0R55nqUW1oPzM,1,Very bad service I am first on the line who ordered but I am the last who was serve not even saying thank you april 27 at 7:30pm.when I ask the lady where is my pizza and supposed to be serve first and she give a nasty looks.it is in telepizza martines de la riva.Staff unprofessional  especially the latina lady muy mala.

ChIJd_9n03AmQg0RP-d94LCHqNE,5,"The ribs and pork filet are absolutely delicious! Recommend BBQ sauce for ribs and garlic sauce for filet. The unpeeled potatoes are good. Avoid the chicken and chips, they are bland."
ChIJd_9n03AmQg0RP-d94LCHqNE,5,"The best chicken in Vallecas by far. Spectacular flavor, if you try it you will definitely repeat it. They have sauces to accompany which I have tried practically all of them and personally I prefer the homemade one and the leek one, but I have to say that the rest are equally delicious. The attention is always very pleasant from the entire team that makes up the establishment, but especially from the blonde girl who, despite the establishment having queues that cross streets, always maintains a positive attitude."
ChIJd_9n03AmQg0RP-d94LCHqNE,2,"Today, Easter, like never before, I had the potatoes from another day and the chicken too, I'm not happy, I won't buy more."
ChIJd_9n03AmQg0RP-d94LCHqNE,5,"Very good price and quality ratio. Excellent flavor and above all very good service, very attentive, the chicken very juicy and the potatoes cooked to order! Pleasant atmosphere, service to eat there!"
ChIJd_9n03AmQg0RP-d94LCHqNE,5,"It is the first time we have bought here.
Walking along Avenida San Diego you get the smell of coal and it is impossible not to stop by and see what that incredible smell gives off.
You arrive at this store and you prepare to see what they have, since everything looks good, we bought half a chicken, half a portion of potatoes and a Creole chorizo, it came with a sauce to choose from and we chose the spicy sauce.
And a Burger No. 1, the burger was very good, good piece of meat and good seasonings.
The truth is that everything was very good, both the potatoes, the chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãand the chicken, everything mixed with the sauce was incredible.
Quality-price: everything was very good, it is true that it is a little more expensive than other places we have eaten, but it is worth it.
We will repeat"
ChIJrynxXQsmQg0RuVd_xnSmLaE,1,"recently had an awful experience at this restaurant, where the staff made it clear that customer service was their last priority.
After waiting over an hour with no attention, we couldn‚Äôt even get someone to take our order properly. Worst of all, this white shirt  staff member was especially rude and dismissive, making us feel entirely unwelcome.
Despite trying to get his attention, he acted as like very very unprofessional he need to get everyday training before he start his job

If you value respectful service, avoid this place ‚Äì especially because of that one extremely rude staff member. Save your time and money and go somewhere that actually values its customers"
ChIJrynxXQsmQg0RuVd_xnSmLaE,5,Really nice food. We had the skewers and the lamb tagine. Lovely portions and the tagine particularly was excellent. We ate quite early and it was filling up with families as we left. Great value and delicious food.
ChIJrynxXQsmQg0RuVd_xnSmLaE,5,The best food halal en Madrid all it‚Äôs delicious
ChIJrynxXQsmQg0RuVd_xnSmLaE,5,"The food is tradition accurate, really tasty. Great quality quantity price ratio overall.

Came here 3 times with my friends and never regretted it.

Could improve the service atmosphere, though. More smiles, and gentleness would be the top tier."

ChIJ-fOTiXYmQg0RAdx9XDrV-CY,5,Awesome cocido and seafood revuelto. Reasonably priced
ChIJ-fOTiXYmQg0RAdx9XDrV-CY,4,I got the Cocido and it‚Äôs highly recommended!
ChIJ-fOTiXYmQg0RAdx9XDrV-CY,3,"Fine ""cocido"" at 37 ‚Ç¨, pricey  red wine. Nice service though they had to be asked several times. All in all, fair quality restaurant"
ChIJ-fOTiXYmQg0RAdx9XDrV-CY,3,"Seemed like a decent-to-good local spot that got ‚Äúfamous‚Äù from some travel blogs. Food was just okay - we went pretty late in the day and everything was very over cooked/dry and we didn‚Äôt get much meat (no ham, 2 small pieces of sausage, etc). The wine was decent and the service was great but for the price and how far away this is from city center it wasn‚Äôt worth it for us."
ChIJBcjx3QomQg0R7NlKqN2ErZw,5,"Been here a couple of times but this is the first time for food. Had the exotic croquettas and some vegano options.

It was all lovely, portion sizes were decent, well priced and very tasty.

I love reading the lowest reviews of a place, all the bad reviews of the rude staff are just from snowflakes, the staff are lovely, yes they have character but that just adds to the ambiance of the place.

Check it out, you'll love it"
ChIJBcjx3QomQg0R7NlKqN2ErZw,5,Wonderful restaurant with various options to try exotic meat and eggs. The owners are exceptionally friendly and the atmosphere is very nice. Will definitely repeat :)
ChIJBcjx3QomQg0R7NlKqN2ErZw,5,Vegan croquetas were so yummy! Very nice owner
ChIJBcjx3QomQg0R7NlKqN2ErZw,5,Cool place
ChIJBcjx3QomQg0R7NlKqN2ErZw,5,"One of the few places in Madrid where you can eat exotic meats and at a very good price. Although we had tried almost all of them in other countries around the world, we loved trying a place with such an original menu... This time we went for the meats (elk, bison and crocodile), next time we will go for the black emu eggs!‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJMdlxHgsmQg0RQ7BrJUSS1GE,5,"I would say the food was really Outstanding and excellent service.
I really suggest it if you want to try Peruvian food."
ChIJMdlxHgsmQg0RQ7BrJUSS1GE,4,Good food huge portions and very friendly people. We enjoyed it and the ceviche was delicious. Prices affordable and if you are two people 1/2 a chicken is more than enough
ChIJMdlxHgsmQg0RQ7BrJUSS1GE,3,"Swap to Spanish

This is a cozy typical Peruvian Restaurant. Food had good flavor, great texture, looking good. The service it's not the best. Server did not have knowledge of the Menu, restrooms aren't clean."
ChIJMdlxHgsmQg0RQ7BrJUSS1GE,5,"Me encantaaaaa!!!!
Always lovely taste !!!

ChIJMcRUqw0mQg0ROU0LmyQPpY4,1,"We found the meat plate quite unpleasant and inedible, since the meat was - some undercooked, some scorched black, so no good taste. Only one sausage was very good. Then there was no sidedish with the meat. And we ordered salad, but we did not get it."
ChIJMcRUqw0mQg0ROU0LmyQPpY4,4,Nice place for a hanging out if you are staying nearby. Good food and reasonable drinks prices. Must try out Atilas  (chicken wings).
ChIJMcRUqw0mQg0ROU0LmyQPpY4,1,Very bad. I hate them
ChIJMcRUqw0mQg0ROU0LmyQPpY4,5,Good prices too
ChIJMcRUqw0mQg0ROU0LmyQPpY4,5,Lovely neighborhood bar
ChIJZ3ZEv98lQg0RIjAg4HnzEvg,4,good experience. Friendly waitress. Lovely kebab.
ChIJZ3ZEv98lQg0RIjAg4HnzEvg,5,Cheap and good food. The staff can speak English which is very helpful. The person at the counter mentioned that everything is halal.
ChIJZ3ZEv98lQg0RIjAg4HnzEvg,2,Not bad and prices are very good.
ChIJZ3ZEv98lQg0RIjAg4HnzEvg,3,Ok para fast good.
ChIJZ3ZEv98lQg0RIjAg4HnzEvg,5,They do home delivery
ChIJpSdVAQsmQg0RhSGyB3opOx8,1,"The treatment was quite unpleasant. They send you a piece of ribs when you have asked for two, they give you half as many potatoes, you call them, and they deny it to your face. They have lost a client. The market is complicated and that's why I'm giving you half of what you asked for? Perfect. Keep the other half and without my money."
ChIJpSdVAQsmQg0RhSGyB3opOx8,1,"The worst delivery order of my life, ""American"" food? Not at all... rather, ""junk food."" The first time I ordered, hoping that I would receive some hamburgers that were at least similar to the real American ones, it was a total disappointment, the quality of the ingredients was terrible. After a while I called again with the intention of ordering something different than the burgers, I ordered a Caesar salad with a double portion of chicken paying two euros more but when it arrived I only saw a pile of lettuce immersed in a lot of ""Caesar sauce"" without even a piece of chicken, I couldn't eat more than two leaves of lettuce, it wasn't for appetites.
Well, I called again for the third and last time just to make my thoughts clear about your services."
ChIJpSdVAQsmQg0RhSGyB3opOx8,5,"We had never ordered before and seeing the reviews we were a little afraid, but it turned out that the burgers were good and the fries were crispy. We were very pleasantly surprised. We will repeat without a doubt."
ChIJpSdVAQsmQg0RhSGyB3opOx8,1,"Disgusting, I had to throw away the food, the ribs are not that they were reheated, it's that they must have been from several days ago, stale and tasteless, but they know it because on their website kid 4 stars but try to write that you will see that it is overcooked and you can't give bad reviews, where is healthcare?? They are going to poison us"
ChIJpSdVAQsmQg0RhSGyB3opOx8,1,"More than an hour waiting for dinner, you call and they just say it's on the way. The food arrives cold
Terrible treatment and worse delivery"
ChIJlyLiJ3omQg0R9GOzK3yFCes,5,"Nice bar with amazing tapas, recommended üëåüèª"

ChIJlyLiJ3omQg0R9GOzK3yFCes,5,"We ordered cuttlefish, anchovies and sorrel and they were fresh and very good"
ChIJlyLiJ3omQg0R9GOzK3yFCes,4,"Good place to go eat or have something to drink.
Menu of the day with a good price.
Good appetizers"
ChIJlyLiJ3omQg0R9GOzK3yFCes,4,"Without a doubt, the best of all is the wonderful views of the tracks at the Entrev√≠as station, as redundant as it may sound.
Also highlight the pleasant and circumstantial close treatment of Loli, the waitress. You don't have to worry about finishing your hors d'oeuvre, it will do it for you.
I only have one reproach, I totally disagree with letting babies smoke.
Despite everything, I consider that the experience was most peaceful."
ChIJ9RCy_XomQg0RIxuAG2Oc8Kc,5,"Spectacular place for Madrid fans, good atmosphere, good food"
ChIJ9RCy_XomQg0RIxuAG2Oc8Kc,1,"The food was disgusting and I saw several cockroaches on the floor, they should have a minimum of hygiene."
ChIJ9RCy_XomQg0RIxuAG2Oc8Kc,5,"Spectacular day that we lived surrounded by 100% Madrid people. The treatment with To√±in, his family and his people is 10. And the stew.... exquisite. We will return"

ChIJCW0sgQomQg0Rv6ouYnO9uPw,4,"We arrived by chance one Saturday afternoon, a large group of friends. The place is a bit small but it's enough to have a few beers. They played us the music we asked for, so everything was fine."
ChIJqfOnFSgmQg0Rnxq3wvvNT80,1,"Hands down the worst meal I have had in a long time. This restaurant clearly does not like tourists. We paid 7 euros for beans and ham fat and 2.50 for a glass of skunked white wine. We watched as other  tables were given bread, nice bowls of food and treated well and sat there being ignored and treated horribly. Do not go. There are Many wonderful places in madrid where you will pay half the price for food that is much better."
ChIJqfOnFSgmQg0Rnxq3wvvNT80,5,Needed a place nearby for lunch after visiting Prado and this place was perfect. Love how the menu seems to change depending on the day. Affordable prices with home cooked feel and flavor. Gracias!

ChIJS6ABBAsmQg0R831hYXPy2UQ,4,"Quick and excellent service. We ordered veg  rolls, berenjena, tofu, arroz frito and verduras saltado. Its amazing to see how they catered to us vegans when there is nothing vegan on the menu. 100% recommended for the quality and price.
I don't know why the rating of this restaurant is low. Being vegans we are super pickey and this place didn't disappoint at all.
P.S If you find the food lacking taste, add some salt and it's perfect. They cook with less salt and oil which is really good."
ChIJS6ABBAsmQg0R831hYXPy2UQ,1,"I order through Uber eats. My order never arrived, I waited in front of the building for about 10 min and the driver kept driving in circles. I went upstairs and when I ask for a refund the said the driver was here and waited 40 min. Lies, cause there's a doorman in the building and could have assist them. It was probably the drivers fault but they refuse to refund me. Don't trust to order from this place, they will steal your money."
ChIJS6ABBAsmQg0R831hYXPy2UQ,4,"Very quick service with our family of two adults and two children aged seven and 10. Quick service,  clean and tasty food which came to ‚Ç¨18 in total great value."
ChIJS6ABBAsmQg0R831hYXPy2UQ,3,"The price was ok, but unfortunately I cannot say the same about the food."
ChIJS6ABBAsmQg0R831hYXPy2UQ,4,"I was with the family eating, we are a Spanish-Japanese family. We liked the dishes and the rice dishes were not oily like many places are.
The staff was very friendly and told us which dishes were better because they were not spicy or their children liked them better so they thought the child would too. I especially liked the tofu and the sesame balls.
The place is small (I don't know if it has air conditioning) but at this time the temperature was pleasant. Very kind to the child. There was no fuss or noise, we were very quiet eating.
The taste of the food is very pleasant as I say and the price is very affordable. We paid more or less ‚Ç¨6 per plate with large portions and ‚Ç¨2 for desserts and ‚Ç¨4 for the sesame balls I LOVED them"
ChIJu3LKjXMmQg0RDJtaw37dGHw,5,Very good and nice
ChIJu3LKjXMmQg0RDJtaw37dGHw,3,Ok
ChIJu3LKjXMmQg0RDJtaw37dGHw,5,"One of the best food bars I have been to, they are super attentive to everyone who goes, they know you like you don't, very good service and very good food, the atmosphere is also very good, I recommend it 100%"
ChIJu3LKjXMmQg0RDJtaw37dGHw,5,"THE BEST BAR IN THE DISTRICT, incredible attention from all the staff so that you don't miss anything, taking care of every detail and making you feel at home.

Very good atmosphere among the customers who come to the establishment and the meals they serve are phenomenal, varied menus to choose from first and second courses and if you are in a hurry they have many large sandwiches
.
Without forgetting the vermouth, which they have very good appetizers or an extensive list of portions to accompany the super cold bottles, as well as a great bar that they always have with their famous buckets.
.
Spacious and clean facilities with several televisions so we don't miss important events.

Recommended any day of the year!!!
Congratulations!!!."
ChIJu3LKjXMmQg0RDJtaw37dGHw,5,"The food was delicious. We ordered seafood paella, sangria and a starter of bread with tomato. It is advisable to reserve because it is generally full and you have to wait around 1 hour.

The attention of Fiorella and Helena was spectacular, very attentive and friendly to assist us."
ChIJAYxGsQsmQg0RM0b98qwIpDU,3,"The food was delicious but not exactly to my liking so my opinion might be just that. The atmosphere was a little noisy from my POV. The waitress who served my table was very nice this time. I was charged with some drinks I didn't order but they corrected my bill and I was satisfied, so PAY ATTENTION with it. Overall, a good place to eat and enjoy some live music."
ChIJAYxGsQsmQg0RM0b98qwIpDU,4,The best restaurant of this chain. Excellent Peruvian food. Good price.

ChIJlyNrnHAmQg0REkPBY_BJbbE,5,"We always order the roast chicken menu here so they can bring it to us and it's all delicious, plus a big plus is that with the menu between the bread and the 1 liter drink."
ChIJlyNrnHAmQg0REkPBY_BJbbE,5,Best roast chicken in the neighborhood and of course in Madrid. The salad is one of the best we have eaten in my house and of course we will continue buying and sharing its location whenever possible.
ChIJlyNrnHAmQg0REkPBY_BJbbE,1,"Homemade food with good flavor is indisputable; but the attention to the public is without a doubt disgusting, that man treats you as if you were asking him, he serves you so reluctantly, it seems that he is super fed up with his job; That man makes that moment a super uncomfortable situation."
ChIJq-GL5HomQg0RW0Q3Rw-ZMoM,5,"Nice food, excellent service"
ChIJq-GL5HomQg0RW0Q3Rw-ZMoM,5,"Today we ordered takeout and it was also a success. We called ahead and when we arrived they already had everything ready. The lacquered duck was spectacular and the fried rice with prawns was well done, without excess oil. I like that they maintain quality both in the store and in the orders. A reliable option if you crave authentic Chinese food"
ChIJq-GL5HomQg0RW0Q3Rw-ZMoM,5,"I have returned several times and always leave satisfied. This time we ordered some spring rolls, hot and sour soup and fried noodles with beef to share. Everything arrived hot and well presented. I like that they don't skimp on quantity, ideal if you come hungry or in a group. Plus, the waiters already recognize me, which makes the experience closer."
ChIJq-GL5HomQg0RW0Q3Rw-ZMoM,5,"The first time I came to Greater Hong Kong was on the recommendation of a friend, and the truth is that I was pleasantly surprised. The menu is very extensive and the dishes arrive quickly at the table. I tried the three delicious rice and the chicken with almonds, both very tasty. The service was friendly and the place was clean and quiet. I will return without a doubt."
ChIJq-GL5HomQg0RW0Q3Rw-ZMoM,5,"After several visits I can say that Greater Hong Kong has become one of my favorite places in the neighborhood. I love coming on weekends with my family. They always serve us with a smile and it shows that they care that you have a good experience. Unbeatable quality-price, and the dishes are always well served. Highly recommended."
ChIJJzSQwL8lQg0R6HkDi_nqCLs,1,"The food is cold and you get very little, plus when you order bacon and other things they only make you a slice or two.
The place is not very big and cleanliness is not taken very seriously.
The service is not very good and the food takes a long time to arrive and be cooked, which is why it is almost always cold.
All this means that in my opinion this place is not very pleasant to eat, and that is without taking into account how expensive the prices are and that they are increasing more and more.
For all this, I think it is better to go eat somewhere else that is more profitable."
ChIJJzSQwL8lQg0R6HkDi_nqCLs,5,best atmosphere ever.
ChIJJzSQwL8lQg0R6HkDi_nqCLs,2,MacDonald at this place is quite different. A bit tired and unkempt. At evening hours is usually filled with troublesome boys and girls who come from the notorious neighbourhood of Vallecas. Not recommended for strangers or travellers. Beware of pickpockets and people wanting to sell stolen items to you.
ChIJJzSQwL8lQg0R6HkDi_nqCLs,5,"Big McDonald's restaurants in the heart of Madrid. They are equipped with the self-service kiosks. Therefore you don't need to face issues of not speaking spanish or just loose your time in the que. A lot of spaces to sit are in the two stories above the entrance hall. The restaurant isn't equipped with the USB intlets but you can use the plugs, european of course."

ChIJOYvs98THYw0RARQjS3b1aAk,5,"Excellent food to take away. Roast chickens, French fries, feed, roast ribs, croquettes, salads, desserts, etc. If you order by phone you barely have to wait even if there are people waiting since they have a separate counter. The staff that attends, always, very kindly.  I recommend."

ChIJ4ze7wnQmQg0RNhpm808J0lM,5,"Que bueno! What a wonderful, hidden gem. This, we muse, is what sesame chicken is *supposed* to be‚Äîand not at all what we were expecting when we ordered it.

The hot and sour soup was fascinatingly influenced by Spanish culture; instead of mushrooms and shredded pork, we find a tomato base, chopped veggies, and chopped ham. It was pleasantly sour, not too spicy. How interesting!

The red curry and coconut milk beef was much more mild and unassuming than we expected; certainly delicious, but I couldn‚Äôt really taste the coconut or a distinct curry aspect. The veggies were crunchy and the beef was tender!

The sesame chicken was a thinly sliced chicken breast with a thin batter and an even coat of sesame seeds. No sauce! What?! How unexpected! This was a great treat.

The staff were quite gracious with our Google translate shenanigans, and they gave us lots of water. The tables were a lovely wood with matching chairs. A great space for resting and eating good food‚Äîthe doors were open for ventilation, and the restaurant was a good temperature and lighting amount.

All in all, a wonderful experience. Definitely would recommend, especially to those looking to compare Asian American with Asian Spanish takeout."
ChIJ4ze7wnQmQg0RNhpm808J0lM,5,"We enjoyed several lunches here. Tried different menu items and enjoyed most. The Gyoza, the egg roll, the wonton soup and the Hongkong beef stand out. Created a little English cheat sheet for ordering our favorites"

ChIJDWQskwomQg0Rr6HsSnQe_Zs,4,"The drinks are cheap and the food too. 1.5 for a big one( you can get either beer or wine ) . The best appetizer to get in my opinion are the wings , they're honestly pretty good. Then you also have a big menu of sandwiches and some salad that you can take a look of if you want to eat anything else . Good atmosphere but depending of the day and the hour you go it can get a little overcrowded . It's an autoservice type of bar so you don't have a waiter to attend you at the table . Chairs are not so comfortable  . I think it's a pretty cool place to enjoy some drink with some friends . Nothing too fancy but definitely worth for what you're paying for."
ChIJDWQskwomQg0Rr6HsSnQe_Zs,4,"For a quick and cheap bite, you might want to go there. 100 Montaditos is a chain throughout Spain that sell 100 different mini sandwiches (that's what the name stands for) and some other food (nachos, salad, olives,...). And of course beer, tinto de verano and soft drinks.
Usually the places are very crowded but you may find a table. 100 Montaditos does not charge any extra fees for sitting outside."
ChIJZU7UP98lQg0RjR7XAixjbGw,5,"The owner is an experienced and very good cook! Always fresh top quality products, and the food is exquisite! In few places will you try food with that exceptional flavor and texture! Thanks to a great cook. All for ‚Ç¨10 a menu.

If I could give it 6 stars, I would (but Google won't let me, so I passively protest with this review).
The staff is so nice that it makes you want to invite them to your birthday. They serve you with a genuine smile, not one of ""I'm getting paid for this"", but one of ""I'm happy you came"".

The place is vegetarian, but not the type that lectures you while you eat. Here you simply enjoy, and at the same time, you feel like you are saving the planet with every bite.

In addition, they promote equality, which is noticeable and appreciated. It's not posturing, it's coherence.
Background music? Topics. Neither so strong that it bothers, nor so soft that it goes unnoticed. The playlist must have been made by someone with very good taste (or simply superior intelligence).

And yes, there are board games! You can have a spectacular day.

100% recommended. Ideal to go with friends, with your grandmother or with yourself if you need a place that hugs your soul a little.
I will return. And not just once.

I do not doubt that fresh and in good condition products are of quality, but I strongly advise against buying ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù through apps like ‚Äútoo good to go‚Äù. It's one thing to leave certain pieces that may be more mature or not as good looking at a reduced price, but selling rotten food, no matter how low the cost, is insulting. They should take this into account, since normally people who resort to this are because they either have few resources or need to save some money on the purchase, not to throw food in the trash, which they can do if the product is not in condition to be sold to the public."

They serve it in four steps: the croqueta, the soup, then the chickpeas with the meat and vegetables and a dessert to put a sweet end. Staff was kind and they serve all dishes very nicely.

The passion and talent shown by the artists is very inspiring and powerful. You can feel their love for what they do.

It consists in almost 1 and a half hour of flamenco show with one small break in between.

Friendly staff, typical decoration and some options of food, but not many options unfortunately.

Anyway, I believe it‚Äôs a recommended alternative if you want real flamenco in Madrid for an affordable price and avoiding the most touristic (and expensive) centric locations. Only 10 min by cab from the center, so it‚Äôs worth it if you are looking for good quality and affordable flamenco.

Huge thank you to Sara Ramos, the incredible flamenco artist, who very kindly took a picture with my mum after the showüíÉ

Hidden gem in Vallecas!"
ChIJP2hACd4lQg0RCmmAoVG6gqg,4,"More spacious than other Flamenco venues, and with well portioned food. The tortilla serves two easily. The only downside is the ""hidden"" entrance. We spent 20min trying to find it. Google maps takes you to the wrong place. The actual entrance is right by a restaurant by the sidewalk."
ChIJP2hACd4lQg0RCmmAoVG6gqg,5,Our family had a wonderful experience here! We booked a workshop + show + dinner via Viator/Visit A City and had a blast! Very easy to get to. Straight shot on line 1 metro from the train station right to the area and then a 1 min walk. What we loved was how intimate and personal the experience was. The workshop helped us really understand the culture and musicality and history of flamenco. We learned so much and got to try it ourselves! So fun! My only regret was not dancing more with my daughters on stage during the workshop! The dancers and musicians were incredible. Truly have a passion for their art. It was an immersive experience and one I will recommend again and again! A highlight of our trip to Madrid!
ChIJc8zvNuAlQg0RLDkHlDQ20Rs,5,"This is exactly how a real craft beer place is supposed to be; they brew their own beer on site, it's incredibly fresh tasting, with a friendly owner."
ChIJc8zvNuAlQg0RLDkHlDQ20Rs,5,This is a great Vacation brewery. Wonderful beer and the selection changes regularly.
ChIJc8zvNuAlQg0RLDkHlDQ20Rs,5,Homebrew beers! You can sit behind the brewing machines and see the brewing process. Tasty beers and nice people.
ChIJc8zvNuAlQg0RLDkHlDQ20Rs,5,"It's a brewery so all or most of the beer on tap is brewed on the premises. The owners are really sweet and attentive, if you ask they'll even give you a tour of the brewery or explain their ethos behind the place. And the beer, well, the beer is great!! The owner is also the brewmaster and he knows his stuff."
ChIJc8zvNuAlQg0RLDkHlDQ20Rs,5,Great beer every time! They have hummus as a vegan option
ChIJl7nUUikmQg0RO-dZ1bnOVgc,5,What a gem! So delicious! We had many of the tostadas on the menu and all of them were amazing! Our server Patricia was sweet and had the best recommendations for wine. Everything was so fresh! Loved the neighborhood vibe and definitely worth the ride out of the city center.
ChIJl7nUUikmQg0RO-dZ1bnOVgc,5,"A lot of choices on the menu at a good price.  Staff was extremely friendly and fast even with a lot of filled tables.

We came back three times and had different things each time. All were great. Not just the usual tourist food."
ChIJl7nUUikmQg0RO-dZ1bnOVgc,5,"Authentic, delicious Spanish experience. Definitely require a native speaker to gain the full potential (and not be duped out of an owed course or two), but it you want the rustic local good meal, bottle of wine and off hand banter/traditional service, this is a place to go."
ChIJl7nUUikmQg0RO-dZ1bnOVgc,3,Food was delicious but order carefully. We were stuck paying double for our meal and had no way to clear it up as the employees left early and we had to settle the bill with the poor old chef.
ChIJl7nUUikmQg0RO-dZ1bnOVgc,4,Good service. Good wines and impressed by their toasts.
ChIJad6gpcMlQg0R2FOaffq4NRs,4,"Were short of their promotions and beverage item. Heck, even seemed short of staff."
ChIJad6gpcMlQg0R2FOaffq4NRs,5,Super
ChIJad6gpcMlQg0R2FOaffq4NRs,5,Super üëåüèªüëåüèª
ChIJad6gpcMlQg0R2FOaffq4NRs,4,Very close to my place and taste delicious...üëç
ChIJad6gpcMlQg0R2FOaffq4NRs,4,Good people amazing pizza.
ChIJsQylGeglQg0R5n2B4pQo0RM,5,They have delicious breads and donuts. They were also very nice and helpful even though we don't speak Spanish.
ChIJsQylGeglQg0R5n2B4pQo0RM,5,"Great bread, croissant delicious, their homemade orange jam is a must. Very attentive customer service. A bit out of the city center but super easy to get there from Buenos Aires metro station is only 8min walk. Ah, and their tuna empanada is to die for. They have a variety of fresh bread every day."
ChIJsQylGeglQg0R5n2B4pQo0RM,5,"Cute neighborhood bakery offering only gluten free bread, pastries and cookies along with coffee and tea. Very welcoming"
ChIJsQylGeglQg0R5n2B4pQo0RM,5,Good
ChIJsQylGeglQg0R5n2B4pQo0RM,5,"First time I go with the family.
We have ordered batons, chocolate and coffees and I have to say that the only one with celiac disease was me and everyone else's impressions of the batons have been great. Incredible flavor and texture.
Finally, after many years, I have been able to eat some delicious porras, and delicious hot chocolate.
We will return.
Of course, I also took a bar and a croissant to continue enjoying their products."
ChIJf9yQ79YlQg0ROIzoOEluw_U,4,"Typical Cruz Blanca, with its usual decoration, run by Chinese staff, very pleasant and nice, the food is very good, I ordered some bravas and a Coca Cola and they were great. A quiet place at least in the afternoon and good atmosphere. I recommend it."
ChIJf9yQ79YlQg0ROIzoOEluw_U,1,"That bar is in front of the school and at snack time it is normal to go there, but as soon as we enter with the children the Chinese man gets very angry. The owner, I suppose, is the woman. She has a good character and when we go, she is grateful that one chooses that place. We recommend divorce to be able to feel comfortable ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
ChIJf9yQ79YlQg0ROIzoOEluw_U,5,"It surprised us!!! We are a group of 10 people who always go together. We went today and we ate very very well. Your weekend menu is very good.  Furthermore, the owners are very friendly and close. Congratulations!!!"
ChIJf9yQ79YlQg0ROIzoOEluw_U,3,This bar is currently run by staff of Chinese origin with a Spanish cook.  The food in general was normal.
ChIJf9yQ79YlQg0ROIzoOEluw_U,1,"A real rubbish. Omelette that is both hot and cold, some dried artichokes and some inedible squid. Don't go!! And on top of that, very expensive."
ChIJxxceINElQg0RCnv3Z605DRg,5,Delicious rotisserie chicken and croquetas! Great place to take out (no seating when we were there).  It was our first stop in Madrid and they were very welcoming.
ChIJxxceINElQg0RCnv3Z605DRg,5,"Great roast chickens, a bit lacking but in these times everything goes up and it is logical. The croquettes are great, and to ensure the shot, call ahead to reserve, especially the ham ones. A bit slow in serving you but normal. I hope they continue just as well for much longer and don't change."
ChIJxxceINElQg0RCnv3Z605DRg,5,"A paella of 10
Perfect rice with a lot of meat and seafood, even though we had eaten it after 15 minutes of giving it to us, the rice was not stale and it had an excellent flavor. I recommend it. I had already eaten chicken, which is spectacular, but the paella really surprised me. The treatment of the guys who serve you is excellent and very familiar, it is a pleasure to meet people like that. I recommend it to everyone. Thank you very much."
ChIJxxceINElQg0RCnv3Z605DRg,1,"I ordered 1/2 suckling pig for New Year's Eve. When I picked it up it was cold, from the fridge, probably made the day before or so I want to think. Wrinkled like a raisin and dwarf. The ovens are very dirty, the exposed food is dry. I neither recommend it nor will I return."
ChIJxxceINElQg0RCnv3Z605DRg,5,"The infinite quality, a quantity for 8 that 10 of us could eat perfectly, punctually and the rice was just right. I recommend it 100x100. The girls are charming and Pablo is as friendly as always. We will return."
ChIJ-U7Srd0lQg0RinWu1kH6e9I,1,"The worst Burger King I've ever visited in my life. It had only 3 people working in the whole establishment, and the place was very messy as a result.

The bathroom had some puke around the toilet -even when it was locked behind a password (1212)-.

The food is overpriced and not worth it for the extremely small portions that they serve.

Come here if you want to get scammed."
ChIJ-U7Srd0lQg0RinWu1kH6e9I,5,Few scumbags around here. The food is fine...its burger king. Not the healthiest. Whatever! Few local Madrid scrotebags seem to hang around here.
ChIJ-U7Srd0lQg0RinWu1kH6e9I,2,"I rate only 3 stars because I bought 2 combos, when I asked for ketchup the guys told me very friendly it cost 0.5 cent each one, even when prices are higher than last year, can‚Äôt believe it.

Attention from staff and food was very good."
ChIJ-U7Srd0lQg0RinWu1kH6e9I,2,Teque√±os? That's not a teque√±o lol. Tasteless. Had to wait 10 minutes for 6 tiny tasteless cream fingers. At least there's refillable soda and a direct passage to the Mercadona inside the mall.
ChIJ-U7Srd0lQg0RinWu1kH6e9I,3,"Poor quality food, but extremely affordable if you use promo codes."
ChIJ_VugzsIlQg0ROyrfnDPz4IQ,5,Ideal
ChIJ_VugzsIlQg0ROyrfnDPz4IQ,5,A 100% recommended site. The cakes are to die for and we recommend ordering the cheese and bacon potatoes. Very good value for money. The treatment is unbeatable.
ChIJ_VugzsIlQg0ROyrfnDPz4IQ,5,"You will find the best cakes here. We have known them for quite some time and they have never lowered the quality of their products. Besides, they are fast and very friendly. üíØ*üíØ Recommended!!"
ChIJ_VugzsIlQg0ROyrfnDPz4IQ,5,The best cakes in the world! The staff is very close and friendly!! Highly recommended
ChIJ_VugzsIlQg0ROyrfnDPz4IQ,5,"New üìû: 911483373

I can't stop praising the incredible experience we've had with Teletorta de Puente de Vallecas! We have placed several delivery orders, and each time we have been impressed with the exceptional quality of their food.

Each bite is an explosion of flavors that demonstrates the dedication and passion they put into their cooking.

Customer service deserves special recognition. Always friendly and professional, they have made each delivery a hassle-free experience.

I highly recommend Teletorta de Puente de Vallecas to all those looking for something different and very delicious. Recommended for children.

Thank you to the team for your hard work and for delighting us with each delicious delivery!"
ChIJQ9Ybwt0lQg0RvZy-R8FiiYc,3,The food is good and inexpensive but the place is extremely cold
ChIJQ9Ybwt0lQg0RvZy-R8FiiYc,5,Delicious
ChIJQ9Ybwt0lQg0RvZy-R8FiiYc,5,"Muy rica la comida, raciones buenas de cantidad y muy rica la comida, hemos pedido el men√∫ del d√≠a, que a todas estas, bastante econ√≥mico, y muy rico y abundante, recomendado ir"
ChIJQ9Ybwt0lQg0RvZy-R8FiiYc,5,"Everything was freshly made! The chicken was crispy even though it was glazed by the sauce and juicy inside, the rice released a lot of steam like I have never seen. The only thing is the delay: we waited an hour due to so many orders they had, but it was worth every second of waiting and I will order again for their delicious food!"
ChIJQ9Ybwt0lQg0RvZy-R8FiiYc,1,"Shit food, the meat was of dubious origin and the service was terrible, I went with my husband and he is dying. He won't stop vomiting, you must improve a lot. Good night"
ChIJ__lyeuYlQg0RgaQ04mdkK2w,5,"Food was amazing
Photos do not do it justice
A great place to go before the game at Rayo Vallecano"
ChIJ__lyeuYlQg0RgaQ04mdkK2w,1,"Last night we ordered a portion of Andalusian anchovies and they gave us 12 anchovies counted and placed in single row on a small rectangular plate, and I'm not exaggerating. A shame. They give you that as a cover in any normal bar. ‚Ç¨12 a portion. To euro per anchovy. A robbery."
ChIJ__lyeuYlQg0RgaQ04mdkK2w,4,"Good, homemade food. Atmosphere with pleasant music."
ChIJ__lyeuYlQg0RgaQ04mdkK2w,1,"We were in this area and decided to have some beers on the outdoor terrace of this bar. They were served to us accompanied with an appetizer, the problem came when it was time to pay that we complained to the waitress about the bill up to five times, but in the end we had no choice but to get up and go to pay at the bar. Normal prices, although it is a place I would not return to again."
ChIJ__lyeuYlQg0RgaQ04mdkK2w,1,"The worst place to work, the owner is unpresentable, impolite and rude. If there is something he doesn't like to hear, he responds rudely and with insults.
A place not recommended!!

In response to your comment,
Thank goodness I didn't get to work with someone who gives options and when they choose one they don't like, they send you to chprla, if that's your hiring process... What a way. Start by correcting that.
If you need people immediately, do not give incorporation options that you will not respect later.
And of course I hang up the phone, I wasn't going to let him continue insulting me.
Improve your attitude first before talking about me."
ChIJxy6yuNglQg0R6X8oVdSAATA,3,Really good place to have fresh food and a pleasant atmosphere.
ChIJxy6yuNglQg0R6X8oVdSAATA,3,Not bad
ChIJxy6yuNglQg0R6X8oVdSAATA,5,Ok
ChIJxy6yuNglQg0R6X8oVdSAATA,5,"It is the perfect place to have a snack, as well as to eat! Customer service 10! Sympathy and kindness of the staff at all times. Very tasty food, and quality/price ratio surprised us a lot because the ‚Ç¨16 menu was exquisite - at this price few places serve food so well! They also have good wines and looking at the menu we are encouraged to come again because we want to try more things and the variety of dishes attracts us a lot, especially knowing that the cook prepares some delicacies! Apart from the very good service on the terrace from the waiters, they have advised us to come eat in the lounge inside the restaurant, it is cozy, we have had a wonderful time in this place eating, chatting, enjoying the company of our friends and a very family on the part of the cafeteria/bar staff Leandro. We will return soon!"
ChIJxy6yuNglQg0R6X8oVdSAATA,5,"When there are many people, the quality of service drops. There is usually a lot of noise in the place to talk, it is a lively bar, ideal if you are looking to socialize.
As for tapas, I always crave the one on the next table more, but I'm hard to please.
They also have the possibility of sandwiches when everyone around them stops serving when the kitchen closes."
ChIJi34UCN8lQg0R_Hh28_tcfE0,5,"We ordered the patatas bravas , gambon, and alitas (we forgot to take a photo) gin and tonic, and estrella Galicia‚Äôs . Everything was honestly great here the service was very friendly and the staff were very accommodating. The food had a great amount of flavor and sauce which is usually lacking  in other bars and restaurants . 100% would return !! Also the jam√≥n and queso tapas werefresh and had nice flavor . The shrimp was very fresh as well"
ChIJi34UCN8lQg0R_Hh28_tcfE0,4,Nice tapa with the drinks. Waiters are nice and atmosphere is relaxing.
ChIJi34UCN8lQg0R_Hh28_tcfE0,5,Great food and service!
ChIJi34UCN8lQg0R_Hh28_tcfE0,4,Just I took a coffee
ChIJi34UCN8lQg0R_Hh28_tcfE0,4,"After a long time we decided to try this place.
Although we were more than 10 people, they had no problem finding space on the terrace.
It is more worth ordering a mounted one than the sandwich, since for price there is a big difference in terms of size, not too much.
Regarding the burgers, due to the price and the neighborhood where it is located, I expected more quantity. Since on the menu they put it as the best, I have tried better and larger quantities in the area.
And as for the service, only one waitress to take care of the interior and the terrace. Something that if you have patience is fine but another table got up and left."
ChIJ2wTyV94lQg0RsPWA162jhxA,1,"It's closed and it's a shame, big place and many possibilities"
ChIJ2wTyV94lQg0RsPWA162jhxA,5,"I never thought that inside the stadium there would be a bar with such high quality. What delicious beans! Tasty, tasty. Wheelchair enabled, spacious, large and clean bathrooms, they smelled good. Perfect for a menu of the day, if I moved around that area more I would go to eat more often. The desserts are very very delicious. In case you haven't noticed, I quite liked it. The best thing of all is that it is not very visible, although many people know it there is always room, it is very big."
ChIJ2wTyV94lQg0RsPWA162jhxA,1,"It's a shame...on the day that Rayo wins its first title in history, they kicked us out before starting the game and told us that they weren't going to put the TV on because they didn't have many customers (there were 20 of us at the door) if you want to make money, go somewhere else and don't mess around.
THE STRIP IS SACRED...but not yours pesetero"
ChIJ2wTyV94lQg0RsPWA162jhxA,5,It's a shame it closed its doors.
ChIJ2wTyV94lQg0RsPWA162jhxA,4,"A must-visit bar for the Rayistas, its owner, Cota, the captain of the strip for many years, runs this bar that is located on the Rayo field, before the game, after, during the week, it is open, they make menus, and they are very attentive, You can watch Rayo's games when they play away on the big screen.
Aupa Ray o."
ChIJr6JJn98lQg0Rnqd2Up0Fhqc,5,We dropped in for lunch and had fried chicken and ceviche. Both dishes were incredible. The waiter was very nice. Really high quality and value for money. Highly recommended!
ChIJr6JJn98lQg0Rnqd2Up0Fhqc,4,Decent place for a couple of drinks and a bite
ChIJr6JJn98lQg0Rnqd2Up0Fhqc,5,"Excellent treatment and food from everyone, especially Eugenio. We go every Thursday and it is always an exceptional deal, very delicious and homemade food. Very good price quality"
ChIJr6JJn98lQg0Rnqd2Up0Fhqc,5,"Everything is very delicious, we always go with my friends from Peru, but what makes the experience 10 points is the attention of Eugenio el Chamo üôåüèª"
ChIJr6JJn98lQg0Rnqd2Up0Fhqc,5,"Everything was excellent, the food was delicious, and the customer service was spectacular, the menu is super good value for money, today I ate a delicious menestron soup with a lomo saltado"
ChIJj0CpfbslQg0RMK-6uBa2u6U,5,Great food (I love the combination of freshness of the curtido with the pupusas) and great value too.
ChIJj0CpfbslQg0RMK-6uBa2u6U,4,"Food was really really good, just a shame they didn't have some of the drinks and items on the menu."
ChIJj0CpfbslQg0RMK-6uBa2u6U,5,"Real Salvadorean pupusas and they're excellent! Plenty of curtido y salsa, also delicious."
ChIJj0CpfbslQg0RMK-6uBa2u6U,5,"Nice tacos, specially the cochinita pibil...."
ChIJj0CpfbslQg0RMK-6uBa2u6U,1,Regular
ChIJeXNV6nUmQg0RVQI_ML2yAmk,4,"First time inside this bar since last seeing the original owner (Guerrero), 30 years ago. Due to changes in the neighborhood, bar is not as busy as it used to be."
ChIJeXNV6nUmQg0RVQI_ML2yAmk,5,"I love this site. Not suitable for exquisite palates but perfect for people who like traditional bars. A multitude of beers, all very delicious and at reasonable prices. I will always return!!!"
ChIJeXNV6nUmQg0RVQI_ML2yAmk,5,"Quality and cheap food. Very good treatment, a traditional neighborhood bar."
ChIJeXNV6nUmQg0RVQI_ML2yAmk,5,"Some amazing torreznos that they give you for free with your cold beer, a success to enjoy a day in Vallekas"
ChIJeXNV6nUmQg0RVQI_ML2yAmk,5,"Cold beers from many brands, the guy who serves spectacular, the torreznos to lick your fingers, a good place to have tapas and leave well eaten"
ChIJ0_v07HYmQg0RgLIDGJC48xM,1,So expensive ü´∞
ChIJ0_v07HYmQg0RgLIDGJC48xM,2,Psss
ChIJ0_v07HYmQg0RgLIDGJC48xM,5,Nice
ChIJ0_v07HYmQg0RgLIDGJC48xM,5,Torreznos top
ChIJ0_v07HYmQg0RgLIDGJC48xM,5,"A reference place in the neighborhood and the only one perfect for having Vermouth, dining or eating with a variety and excellent quality, not to mention the best Caracoles in Madrid without a doubt and a close service and professionalism like few others can find.
Come closer and you will see it in first person. You will not repeat yourself"
ChIJLf9UIgAnQg0RkhlL6QqFeWE,5,"Quite possibly the best Kebap in the area. Excellent quality/price ratio, fresh and tasty ingredients, delicious bread and durum.

And the guys are nice and kind.

Don't miss it!"
ChIJLf9UIgAnQg0RkhlL6QqFeWE,5,"The Durum are well loaded and made with love, with very crunchy bread, as well as the fries. Very well priced. The guys who serve you and prepare your food are quite nice and also the terrace is really cool."
ChIJLf9UIgAnQg0RkhlL6QqFeWE,5,"The kebab is very delicious. Very loaded, hot, lots of sauce, crusty bread, a spectacle. Looking forward to returning another day for a durum."
ChIJLf9UIgAnQg0RkhlL6QqFeWE,1,"When you go to a kebap, you don't expect it to be a delight for the senses, as long as the food is good and they are friendly, you have everything won. Starting from that, they have an offer of kebap 1.50 or durum 2.50 euros from Monday to Thursday to take away. They always overcharge you and when you tell them hey, you have an offer apart from few manners, they start whispering among themselves and looking at each other badly. When they prepare it, they don't even ask you, therefore they always put it wrong. The quality of the normal food is low, added to their lack of professionalism and their rudeness, making it a place not to go."
ChIJLf9UIgAnQg0RkhlL6QqFeWE,5,"One of the best Kebaps in Vallecas, the quality of the food is very good and so is the service, they always serve you with a smile and with politeness. Seeing the negative comments I can only think that the competing kebaps wanted to lower their score.
By the way, it also has a terrace for the summer, we always come back"
ChIJe1bScQAlQg0RL0o4bNEXUGY,5,"Beautiful place, spectacularly delicious food, very generous quantities in each of their dishes and very very reasonable prices.
We ordered the teque√±os (which are mandatory, they were delicious), the arepas, a cachapa, patac√≥n and for dessert the 3 leches candy. 5 stars seem not enough for this place, we will return for the third time and it will not be the last. Highly recommended!"
ChIJe1bScQAlQg0RL0o4bNEXUGY,4,I have been attending for a long time and they never let me down. The food is very delicious and they have a menu with a great variety of our Venezuelan dishes. The staff is usually very friendly and they are always attentive and pleasant. I highly recommend the cachapas; especially the pernil. The paper could improve. And Carla's empanadas are a delight.
ChIJe1bScQAlQg0RL0o4bNEXUGY,5,"Everything was spectacular but the grill and the drinks were the best.  The portions are super large. It is a place to repeat.
The attention of 10!
It is a place to go with friends or family."
ChIJe1bScQAlQg0RL0o4bNEXUGY,5,"Very good place: kind and friendly waiters, good prices and delicious Venezuelan food.

Their teque√±os and cachapa are highly recommended. The tres leches for dessert is delicious"
ChIJe1bScQAlQg0RL0o4bNEXUGY,5,"We arrived without a reservation on 02/14 ü´£ and they treated us very kindly, a highly recommended place that surprised us all (6 people), the food was very good, the place was cozy, the decoration for the occasion was very nice and the kindness, we will surely repeat."
ChIJHZ9j9SklQg0RGhG-31q_Z8U,5,The food was great! So tasty and generous portions. I‚Äôve been trying to learn Spanish and the staff were super helpful and patient with me teaching me new phrases! Great experience will return again!
ChIJHZ9j9SklQg0RGhG-31q_Z8U,5,Delicious food and a great Peruvian family hospitality! Would totally recommend.

ChIJ3dloipglQg0R1YvmdxjL8p8,3,"The empanadilla stews are delicious, but they always burn them and they come increasingly empty. I usually order at home and at first very well but they arrive worse and worse."

ChIJCV4E2-klQg0RYdBVBtXZhwU,5,"I love their Peruvian charcoal chicken ü•∞ bought every week, their juicy chicken and the crispy chips"
ChIJc82aaNglQg0RqNFF2pvFibc,5,I live locally and I've been a regular customer here for quite some time. I'm always impressed by the attention of a staff on the quality of the food.
ChIJc82aaNglQg0RqNFF2pvFibc,1,Slow service and a worst tapas...
ChIJc82aaNglQg0RqNFF2pvFibc,5,"Cheap and nice, what's else?"
ChIJc82aaNglQg0RqNFF2pvFibc,3,"Small place located in the Assembly area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMadrid where I was recently to have dinner with friends while we watched a Rayo match on TV. They have a fairly extensive menu. We ordered a combo of portions to share (included chicken wings, patatas bravas and calamari) and some ham croquettes. Nothing particularly caught my attention about the combo, but the croquettes were good, with a good creaminess."
ChIJc82aaNglQg0RqNFF2pvFibc,5,"Neighborhood bar but with much better food than usual. The tortilla is delicious, the croquettes are very good, and the burgers and sandwiches are also very good. In addition, the portions are a good size and very good prices. The waiters are very friendly and the terrace is pleasant."

ChIJhSueVQAlQg0RzTbrYxjcaKU,1,"An hour of waiting is not enough (to pick up 8 strips and two Oreo Shakes), orders that came out unordered, the staff with a lot of stress (which is understandable due to the number of orders, but it is not justification for treating customers rudely)."
ChIJhSueVQAlQg0RzTbrYxjcaKU,1,"I like the food, but the place is chaos and the food never arrives... There seems to be a lack of staff and they are very overwhelmed..."
ChIJhSueVQAlQg0RzTbrYxjcaKU,5,"The best restaurant I have ever seen, clean and good flavor. The employees are very attentive and friendly. The service is spectacular. Without a doubt good place
Always very clean"
ChIJg_XI2dwlQg0RV61Fhs8Gpz4,1,"Rude customer service.
Nobody of course doesn‚Äôt know English to help, in the Capital of Spain with millions tourists around.
I was waiting like 15‚Äô with a baby in a stroller and then a lady decided to tell me that if I want to order something to take out I had to go on the other side wich was not visible and nowhere mentioned.
I don‚Äôt know pizzas taste because they didn‚Äôt want to serving me!"
ChIJg_XI2dwlQg0RV61Fhs8Gpz4,1,Worst restaurant ever.
ChIJg_XI2dwlQg0RV61Fhs8Gpz4,5,No complaints!
ChIJg_XI2dwlQg0RV61Fhs8Gpz4,3,"We ordered a pizza in halves and a dessert to take away. The pizza was traditional dough, half sweet cabrini (goat cheese and caramelized onion) with pulled pork and half serrana (cherry tomatoes, ham and parmesan cheese) with beef kebab. The carbonara base of the first half did not convince us, but the combination of the rest is delicious. We liked the second half (with a tomato base) better, although the beef was a little dry. For dessert we tried the apple yum, and although we prefer the chocolate one, it is delicious (especially if you add cinnamon)."
ChIJg_XI2dwlQg0RV61Fhs8Gpz4,2,"I have celiac disease and I wanted to try a new pizzeria. I ordered delivery and delivery was fast, but the food (gluten-free pizza) was horrible. My partner ordered a regular pizza and the difference between his and mine‚Ä¶ the gluten-free pizza tastes like a cardboard box. I had to pay more money for my food and my food was less and worse than a normal pizza. Also, they denied me an online discount for 3 medium pizzas because mine was gluten free. It's not fair that I have allergies and I have to pay more, I get less food, and the quality is horrible. The only thing I can say is that the pizza was celiac friendly because they make it without cross contamination, but if you eat gluten free, please never eat here and save your money."

ChIJ-XfMfdslQg0RkGjuXPWJQ6I,5,Emblematic site of Vallecas. Very good vibe. Luxury music. And also live performances. And you don't have to wait for the weekend to find all this. Any day is good. It continues to maintain its lifelong essence and that is a merit that is appreciated because why change if everything is perfect? That's why we keep going. And because you walk in there and you feel at home. Thanks to everyone who makes this possible
ChIJ-XfMfdslQg0RkGjuXPWJQ6I,5,"Great place to have some delicious, artisanal and tap beers...have something to snack on...and listen to good rock or if you have to watch football!!!...more than recommended...they serve you well. luxury...unbeatable atmosphere..."
ChIJ5wZ3Z3YmQg0RYIR6EUQwpI8,5,Beautiful decoration and good food. They also have live music on the weekends. The only drawback is that they don't have WiFi and the service is not that good. We will return.
ChIJ5wZ3Z3YmQg0RYIR6EUQwpI8,1,"The treatment of the waiters was terrible, we waited for 15 minutes calling the waiter and he passed us by as he didn't listen, in the end it wasn't time to get up because none of the waiters have come, I don't recommend it to anyone"

The atmosphere is cozy, with a decoration that transports you to Asia. Without a doubt, a place we will return to. Highly recommended!"""
ChIJ-eaejA-IQQ0RPtSEE5rFwZ8,5,"A quiet and super pleasant location, splendid attention. We were having an aperitif and the rice tapa they gave us made us order a portion to take with us, one of the best rice we have ever eaten, flavor, just right, simply magnificent"
ChIJ-eaejA-IQQ0RPtSEE5rFwZ8,5,"Friendly service and good portions, especially the crazy potatoes. Very very nice terrace."
ChIJ-eaejA-IQQ0RPtSEE5rFwZ8,3,"They took a long time, more than 1 hour and we asked to cancel a dish and they did not respond adequately."
ChIJ-eaejA-IQQ0RPtSEE5rFwZ8,1,"Well the truth is that I don't exactly know what to say DISAPPOINTED. A long-standing bar, to which me and my family have always gone, and the former owners were incredible, they treated you great, now suddenly a transfer, the owners don't even speak, not even a simple hello when entering, a table of 12 people ordered 8 portions and 2 plates of broken eggs take 1 hour and a half to come out, in addition to having 2 waitresses there serving like headless chickens, both with everything at the same time one behind the other in single file, I am a waiter and it exists what is called distributing RANKS so that people do not have to wait. It must be said that they do not take much time and there is still room for improvement. I will return especially because of the location, the terrace and the atmosphere, but I won't be able to order food again..."
ChIJ-eaejA-IQQ0RPtSEE5rFwZ8,5,Lifelong bar. Homemade and generous portions. I don't understand the boykot of some neighbor who keeps making life miserable for the workers of this bar. I ignore most of the reviews. They get along badly with the owner and pay for it with the person who runs it. Which is very nice
ChIJm8ByMB2IQQ0RHfyuiNUG6TU,3,Nice people and food is ok.
ChIJm8ByMB2IQQ0RHfyuiNUG6TU,2,"Food was ok, Hawaiian pizza and a durum. Durum was a little small and more expensive than other places I've ordered from.

The main problem was that the food was delivered cold, the drink was kept in the same bag as the chips and durum and the pizza was also cold. I think they didn't use the thermal bag.
I won't be ordering from here again."
ChIJm8ByMB2IQQ0RHfyuiNUG6TU,2,Staff was good but the food was so untested i ordered chicken burger but the meat was smelling something bad üëé

ChIJI8V_0hqIQQ0RYdFNq3F07tg,5,The cheese and truffle ravioli was our favourite! Cute little restaurant and the waiter was very friendly. We packed the leftovers and the waiter gave us tips on how to reheat the food without reducing the quality. The pricing was also good.
ChIJI8V_0hqIQQ0RYdFNq3F07tg,5,"Excellent, authentic food. Friendly and thoughtful service. I am a demanding eater, and  can honestly recommend La Famiglia as one of the best casual restaurants in South Madrid."

ChIJx24b2RyIQQ0R7dzEz0xw81Y,5,"Un local super acogedor, con servicio super cercano y muy necesario en el barrio donde apenas hay sitios como este y tanto se demandan, tanto para recoger como para comer all√≠.
Lo mejor es la atenci√≥n tan personal y atenta de D√©bora. Vas a una cadena pero es como si fueras al bar de toda la vida gracias a ella. Hasta gestionando a su equipo, siempre lo hace de la mejor manera y con una sonrisa.
Tiene sitios muy c√≥modos para comer all√≠, el ambiente y la m√∫sica son ideales.
El buffet es una MARAVILLA. Recomiendo mezclar ingredientes, y en concreto el provolone y el chedar les quedan incre√≠bles.
Muy r√°pido el servicio pero no te da la sensaci√≥n de agobio o de que lo hagan r√°pido.
Opciones sin gluten, muy buenas (barbacoa, jam√≥n...) y muy r√°pidos, y atentos con cubiertos propios precintados."
ChIJx24b2RyIQQ0R7dzEz0xw81Y,1,"We ordered two pizzas without a beacon and when we arrived at my home they had the beacon that I asked not to have, the very kind delivery man charged me, he took the pizzas so they could make change for me. They were delayed, I called to find out if the order has already been sent and they treated us in a very bad way, not at all understandable, they did not offer us if we wanted the pizza cut or if we wanted it uncut, to which they sent us the whole pizza without any cutting. Burnt and with mozzarella cheese that looks like cardboard when chewed. The four cheese one has like a mini foam on top and is inedible, we would like the service to be better next time we order."
ChIJx24b2RyIQQ0R7dzEz0xw81Y,5,"En la villa donde los hombres sacian su hambre con viandas de mil sabores, h√°llase un establecimiento de nombre Telepizza, templo consagrado al arte de la masa y el condumio r√°pido. En este recinto, maestros de la hornaza vierten su sable en discos de pan candeal, untados con la m√°s roja y suculenta salsa del tomate, coronados con quesos derretidos que semejan r√≠os de oro l√≠quido, y guarnecidos con viandas que son regalo para el paladar.

All√≠ acuden gentes de toda ralea: mozos y mozas, infantes regocijados, y a√∫n caballeros de seso grave, todos en busca del gozo que otorga tal fest√≠n. No es menester esperar con ansia, pues presto acuden los sirvientes con cajas humeantes, exhalando perfumes que despiertan los m√°s voraces apetitos. En este lugar de regocijo y holganza, el comercio y la gula caminan de la mano, haciendo que el vulgo y los nobles, por igual, hallen deleite en cada bocado."
ChIJx24b2RyIQQ0R7dzEz0xw81Y,3,"The pizzas were very good and the delivery man was very nice, but in one of them, the green plastic that comes with it must have been because they were bored, they painted it with a black marker and put it on the pizza. When we removed it, logically there was paint from the marker on the pizza, I should be more careful."
ChIJx24b2RyIQQ0R7dzEz0xw81Y,1,"This establishment is a scam. When you order, they tell you that it takes 20 to 35 minutes. When an hour has passed and you call them they tell you that it is raining, that there is a game and that they can't cope, but that it is coming. When you call 1 hour and 50 minutes later with the intention of canceling, they tell you that it just left and can't be canceled anymore, and they hang up on you! Conclusion, a scam. After two hours, it still hasn't arrived, nor do I think it will."

ChIJP0EnxAKIQQ0RxGmIxFhkzK4,1,"DISASTER. HORRIBLE. We innocently visited Pizzeria Carlos with the view to get pasta, of which they had none. Seeing the delicious pizzas on the menu, we quickly became excited and changed our evening plans! A side of Mozerella sticks and battered chillis arrived, a sweaty microwaved mess on a plate. Our hopes for the pizza somewhat resembling those on the menu was shattered! We were optimistic and made a point about giving the pizza a chance, it looked good after all ... but one slice each and it was all so clear, the pizza was terrible, a heap of manky cheap cheese on a slimey slither of dough. Staying optimistic, we decided the best thing to do would be agree to get a pasta else where and get creative with the pizza, but having already eaten too much, our resources were low. (See photo)"
ChIJP0EnxAKIQQ0RxGmIxFhkzK4,4,"The pizzas were great, even though the biggest size they have are more for 3 people than 4"

ChIJ8SJs-wKIQQ0R6-SeN-OexjM,4,Expectacular
ChIJ8SJs-wKIQQ0R6-SeN-OexjM,4,"A Chinese battle restaurant. The food has decreased in quality and quantity. We went to eat the menu. The menu is varied, but the quantity is small. I imagine that when making a menu, the quantity is reduced, but the quality has been somewhat deteriorated from the times we have been. The place is large and practically always has a table. The staff and young and unprofessional. They serve you with reluctance or boredom."
ChIJ8SJs-wKIQQ0R6-SeN-OexjM,5,"Despite the bad reviews I have been ordering here for years and my daughters love it every time we don't know what to have for dinner my daughters say we should take it or order it, this restaurant has never let us down either in the service or the quality. ü•∞"
ChIJ_0rSHAooQg0R4krUvQcGkt4,5,"I have ordered delivery several times, everything is great. One day there was a delay in the order but I called and they told me, even so the food arrived hot as confirmed by the person who assisted me on the phone.
Very delicious burgers and onion rings with beer ü§§"
ChIJ_0rSHAooQg0R4krUvQcGkt4,2,"I tried this site a few months ago and loved it.
I don't know what's happening now that I just received my burnt onion rings, my very soggy hamburger (I ordered it rare) and the completely crushed dog."
ChIJ_0rSHAooQg0R4krUvQcGkt4,3,"Difficult to find due to the hours and the poor visibility of the place but it is surprising when you enter. An American-style diner with a good variety of delicious burgers, hot dogs and other fast food starters and sides. Interesting option for the curious of the neighborhood."
ChIJ_0rSHAooQg0R4krUvQcGkt4,1,"I have never had any problems ordering through Just Eat but this time Burguer Las Vegas decided to become my only unpleasant experience in how many orders I have made on that website. After a long time waiting for my order, I receive nothing and I receive an email that an attempt has been made to deliver. Being at home I am surprised since the apartment's doorman has not been heard. I call to ask what's going on and the girl who answers me, quite rude, tells me that the order is not going to be delivered, that they have already tried to deliver it, that they have already called me by phone and I have not responded (I did not receive a single call). After telling me all that and me insisting that there had been no attempt to deliver correctly, she told me that she was very sorry but that she was not going to be responsible for anything, my money was not going to be returned, my dinner was not going to be delivered and that whatever I complained to Just Eat, as if they were to blame...
Not only that, but the girl tells me that she can't do anything because the restaurant is about to close (she tells me at 00:30) when according to Google it opens until 2:30. Terrible service, and terrible customer service. Of course I will not return to this restaurant, not in person or at home, and I will ensure that no one in my immediate or not so close environment eats in this place.
I put one star on everything because I can't give it less."
ChIJ_0rSHAooQg0R4krUvQcGkt4,1,"This is the second time I have placed an order at Burger Las Vegas through Just Eat and on both occasions the order has arrived more than an hour late, cold and on the second occasion in poor condition, with the lettuce on the burgers rotten and the meat with a very bad acid taste, as if it were overcooked and in very bad condition.  The onion rings arrived completely cold and chewy.  We called the restaurant to complain and for them to give us a solution and they told us that they would send us the order again but that we had to wait an hour and a half more, that is, almost three hours from the time we placed the order.  Regrettable. It is clear that the disastrous organization on the part of the owners and the lack of staff to attend to orders generates unacceptable harm to customers, but the fact that they send you food in poor condition is a danger to the health of consumers."

ChIJD6rTzBOIQQ0R7Q4tMJ61gFw,5,A wonderful neighborhood restaurant not filled with tourists.  My GF has food allergies and Miguel specifically tailored the tasting menu to fit her needs.  All of the courses were unique and delicious.  The weather was beautiful and the terrace was great.  Make a reservation as the terrace was crowded.  Prices were very reasonable.  It was a special experience and the best meal we had in Madrid.  A special thank you to Miguel for his hospitality.  We will see you again.
ChIJD6rTzBOIQQ0R7Q4tMJ61gFw,5,The bbq ribs were melt in your mouth. The scalloped potatoes that came with the ribs were delish. I just wish we had a bigger portion. My husband got the salad which was delicious but for me too much dressing and for him it was perfect. The kids got crayons to color and the owner told us the lovely story how the restaurant got its name. It‚Äôs got a nice local vibe. All the meat had a nice flavor. My son didn‚Äôt finish his burger but he said it was tasty. He was thirsty and drank too much before his food arrived as we were at the zoo all morning and early afternoon.
ChIJD6rTzBOIQQ0R7Q4tMJ61gFw,5,"This is the most amazing restaurant we tried in Madrid so far. We tried the weekly menu and there was a lot of food (too much food if you ask me). The food was very tasty, variated and fresh, but somehow, all gently discussed in some traditional Spanish recipes.
But that wasnt't even the best part. The best part was the service which was outstanding. The personel was very kind with us, helping us choose the food since we don't know spanish language.

Overal it was a great experience and I recommend this restaurant from the bottom of my heart."
ChIJD6rTzBOIQQ0R7Q4tMJ61gFw,5,One of the best salads I had in Madrid. And the steak was very good also.
ChIJD6rTzBOIQQ0R7Q4tMJ61gFw,5,"I had read about this restaurant before my trip to Madrid, it said it was a little way out of town, which it was. It didn't look much from the outside, and arriving there at around 8pm it was empty. I really wondered what I had booked, but that's where it stopped. It was a family run business and the owner couldn't have been more welcoming or accommodating. After about 30 minutes the restaurant was full of locals. I would not hesitate to recommend. It was worth the taxi ride. Best food and cheapest meal we had in Madrid. But you will definitely need to book. We did go Saturday evening though."
ChIJGydDBx6IQQ0RM2ABV3PRXB8,5,Rico
ChIJGydDBx6IQQ0RM2ABV3PRXB8,3,Very cheap with outside seating. Tapas and beer.
ChIJGydDBx6IQQ0RM2ABV3PRXB8,5,"They recommended this place to us and also that we had a lot of patience because it is usually full of people, we ordered cow snout, chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãsalad and 4 large grills, we will return, thank you for the treatment received, daddy:"
ChIJGydDBx6IQQ0RM2ABV3PRXB8,5,"We came to this place super late because we had just arrived from a trip and we had not eaten and when we entered we asked if the kitchen was still open and to our surprise they told us to come in and it was open and without a problem, we saw the menu and decided to go for it. the entrec√¥te and we were very surprised because the presentation was on a stone table and it was very very good, we were satisfied and the service was quick, excellent quality and price. We will return."
ChIJGydDBx6IQQ0RM2ABV3PRXB8,5,"Unbeatable service by waiter Jos√© Duran. Fast and attentive empathetic professional. We are a couple, both in wheelchairs, and we feel very cared for by him. The food tastes great, authentic grill. All great equipment. Thank you very much.  We will always return."
ChIJRe7g7R2IQQ0R237d3FOu9ck,5,"What an absolutely lovely lunch. The lamb was as delightful as I had hoped, and the boquerones were splendid. House Ribera was great, as Hector recommended. The flan was phenomenal, as was the tarta de pi√±ones. Service from Hector was very warm, and the restaurant was lively and well-air conditioned. Highly recommend. Make a reservation if you want the lamb, as it requires at least 2 hrs of cooking. Very much worth the trip and planning."
ChIJRe7g7R2IQQ0R237d3FOu9ck,5,Great dinning experience in Madrid. The grilled hake (cogote de merluza) Is really to die for. Highly recommended!
ChIJRe7g7R2IQQ0R237d3FOu9ck,5,"We spent the day at the Zoo, and as always wanted to avoid the fast food garbage food they usually serve in these places. We found Meson Molinero with the help of tripadvisor and it was a great surprise. It is the kind of place you would never stop by if it was not for a recommendation. Typical Spanish asador with great food and fantastic service. Average price of about 40-45 eur/person which is a bit high for the neighbourhood but good value for money considering quality and service you get. I can really recommend it."
ChIJRe7g7R2IQQ0R237d3FOu9ck,3,"Decent food, disappointing they brag about the Lamb but don't tell you you have to order 2 hours prior dinner even on a Friday night. No English. Even Tempranillo Tinto gets you a beer instead of wine"

ChIJtbVC0hqIQQ0Rnxto_50QNhk,4,"Nice place for breakfast. The local police, fire fighters and paramedics come here for their breakfasts, so you know it's going to be good."
ChIJtbVC0hqIQQ0Rnxto_50QNhk,5,Very good food. The white bean soup fascinated me. The attention was very good. The waiter very friendly and attentive. Very nice and good restaurant.
ChIJtbVC0hqIQQ0Rnxto_50QNhk,5,"The best thing about good restaurant owners is the sum of many factors, feeling at home and paying a good price according to all of this. This is Porto. An Iberian cuisine, good location near the Parque de la Cu√±a Verde, with a good lounge, bar and terrace, careful service, and good quality. I knew the owners of another nearby restaurant in Campamento and this one in the Lucero neighborhood surpasses them. If El Porto is a neighborhood bar, knowing restaurants from all over Europe, long live the Barrio bar.  I ate a special ‚Ç¨33 menu on Sunday, with grilled cod, croquettes, Iberian and grilled prawns, a second entrec√¥te, and for dessert a roasted apple.
To repeat."
ChIJtbVC0hqIQQ0Rnxto_50QNhk,5,"Very good food and very good service.
Lately we are becoming regulars at this restaurant that never disappoints even at lunches or business meals where they have menus of various prices and the quality and quantity is always very good.
It is located in a very quiet area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Latina district on the street of the same name, very close to the Aluche park and other parks."
ChIJtbVC0hqIQQ0Rnxto_50QNhk,5,"Very well-known restaurant in the area, very spacious. Very good value for money. They have a menu of the day with a superior option.

ChIJ6f6ZQxuIQQ0R2xnyRy4XOAk,5,I've had home delivery many times and eaten in. The menu del d√≠a with my nine year old daughter was great in price and quality More than enough and excellent value compared with a menu in other places nearby. It's always busy and I guess that is a good sign üòÉ

Without a doubt, a place we will return to. Highly recommended!"""
ChIJ6f6ZQxuIQQ0R2xnyRy4XOAk,3,"Kindness is his strong point. They serve wonderfully and very quickly. Another thing is the quality of the food, very, very average. Affordable prices."
ChIJ6f6ZQxuIQQ0R2xnyRy4XOAk,3,"The food is good. Service on weekdays is normal.
If you go on the weekend, be very patient. The noise is deafening. The kitchen is very small and cannot accommodate the large number of tables and the delivery service. They serve those who call to order rather than those of us who are sitting."
ChIJ6f6ZQxuIQQ0R2xnyRy4XOAk,1,"The person who serves you and puts you at the table is too rude, raises his voice at you and talks to you in a bad manner without any education, you go to a place to eat and you feel scolded as if they were giving you the food, we have returned and it has been the same with the treatment of this person, I think she is the manager without manners and as if she did not care about the image of the business. Excellent food but terrible service. I will never return"

It is the best kebab in the area without a doubt, I have visited each and every one of the doner kebabs around and none have the quality of this one, the sauce and cheese used have a lot of flavor.

The person in charge of the place (Manuel) is super nice and will always assist you with a smile. I recommend going at least once ‚ô•"
ChIJFe0g_12JQQ0RfXrbF3DvqDQ,5,"The first thing I would highlight is the treatment of the staff. They are all super friendly.

Without architectural barriers."

ChIJiRZiLx2IQQ0RwG0febqXil8,4,"It's the typical ""bar de barrio"" (neighborhood bar) that you will find in this kind of neighborhood areas in Madrid. They put a lot of effort into pleasing theirs customers, but at the end is what is it.
We were around 12 people and our food was coming little by little. It was the case that someone finishes and someone didn't get the food yet.
In any case we could complaint about the quality of the food or the service. Also the kids menu was nice with even present for them at the end.
Specifically nice the cheesecake."
ChIJiRZiLx2IQQ0RwG0febqXil8,4,"We stopped in for a hot drink. The building is beautiful, the people are friendly, and the drinks were refreshing. The postres looked delicious!"

ChIJ9Sk41NyJQQ0Rf9IX-muDac4,1,"Restaurant site, which the Ministry of Health should carry out an inspection for the lack of hygiene: garbage cans next to tables where diners sit, broom and dustpan in the living room and in a deplorable state, drips of dirt on the food chambers‚Ä¶ total lack of hygiene. (See published photos)

The waitress eating and chewing while serving me (amazing).

They have several security cameras and do not report them, as indicated by Law 2/1995 on Private Security. If the Ministry of Telecommunications finds out about this, they face a fine of 600 euros, regardless of what they may impose for lack of hygiene and unhealthiness.

They may also get a surprise and have a visit in the coming weeks.

Anyway... NOT RECOMMENDED"
ChIJ9Sk41NyJQQ0Rf9IX-muDac4,5,"This bar-restaurant is an excellent choice for breakfast, snacks, snacks, lunch or dinner.
We choose to eat on a Sunday, you have a la carte or menu. The menu is well priced and tasty, with four options of starters and mains.
Very friendly and attentive service.
Bravo for the kitchen

ChIJpew43AKIQQ0Rk8Ivw5rxqNs,5,"If you want to eat very delicious traditional Ecuadorian food at a good price, it is a restaurant that makes exquisite food every weekend and on holidays, I recommend the tripes, the fritada, hornado, etc...
Real Ecuadorian food"
ChIJpew43AKIQQ0Rk8Ivw5rxqNs,1,"I had one of the worst experiences in restaurants in Madrid, I really like Ecuadorian food, in this case I was very disappointed and then when I went to pay I found out that you only paid with cash, which they didn't warn me before, I didn't have cash so it was a serious problem for me apart from the fact that the treatment was very offensive, using as an excuse that they have a sign that couldn't even be seen. In general I do not recommend going here at all."
ChIJpew43AKIQQ0Rk8Ivw5rxqNs,4,"Good food, the neighbor serves great!
Successes"
ChIJpew43AKIQQ0Rk8Ivw5rxqNs,5,"A small restaurant in front of the Plaza de la Achicoria, exclusive Ecuadorian menu. There is not much on the menu, but there is enough to leave satisfied, plus quality/price, it is recommended."

ChIJkeDXIwCJQQ0RoJ5v8SgNPNY,2,"Disappointing. When you sit down at the table you are already warned that the letter has certain flaws. When they told us that they did not have family pizzas because the supplier had not arrived on time, we already feared the worst... As for the food, the pasta is not fresh and we can even guess the brand (Garofalo). The preparations are nothing out of this world, since they use a mix of mushrooms, the pizza doughs are not homemade, frozen vegetable garnishes and the pasta dishes are quite bland, dry and difficult to eat. As for the living room, it is cold in it."
ChIJkeDXIwCJQQ0RoJ5v8SgNPNY,1,"It's a shame they missed the opportunity to open a good Italian in the neighborhood. The prices are exorbitant for what they offer. Absolutely tasteless pasta, nothing like the photos. I really think that it is difficult to make good pasta, but it is more difficult to make it so bad. The pizzas are nothing out of this world. The waiters are friendly, but they were not very clear about the menu, perhaps because they have not been open for a long time and there were many changes. In addition, the enclosure of the premises is not well done, there is a lack of insulation and it is very cold.
Unfortunately we will not return."
ChIJkeDXIwCJQQ0RoJ5v8SgNPNY,3,"I expected much more from this restaurant. They have updated the tent that used to be a rice restaurant and now serve Italian food right there. They have not decorated anything at all. In the neighborhood there are several much better Italians for less price than this one, such as fratelli and bella ciao. In short it was a disappointment. I expected much more"
ChIJkeDXIwCJQQ0RoJ5v8SgNPNY,2,"Starting with the service, it leaves a lot to be desired, it is seen that the majority have no experience and are unprofessional, in addition to clearly seeing that they were not rested to perform their duties. On the other hand, the food is more of the same. Fair quality, poorly made product and the only thing I could say positively would be the quantity. The atmosphere, if it is true, apart from the fact that the waiters coughed at you every time they passed by the table, is quite cozy. In short, to try it well but if these aspects do not improve it would be a reason not to return."
ChIJkeDXIwCJQQ0RoJ5v8SgNPNY,5,A pleasant experience. Excellent food and great service. I recommend spaghetti nero di sepia and the risotto. Quality food. We will repeat for sure!!
ChIJS8g2_QKIQQ0RsbTiJzx4zR0,5,"Fantastic, local bar/restaurant with an exceptional and extensive ""Men√∫ del D√≠a""  in the Barrio Lucero for 13‚Ç¨. The Cachopo Asturiano is their featured item, I believe, and it did not disappoint for the second course. Today, I had the oxtail croquettes,  which were really good. A bottle of red wine with ""gaseosa,"" bread, dessert AND coffee is a deal which can not be beat!!  Fast, friendly service, Spanish staff/ownership and clientele, and kind of hidden-away gem if you didn't already know it was there."
ChIJS8g2_QKIQQ0RsbTiJzx4zR0,5,"Great value basic (menu) lunch, served by very friendly staff. If you're looking for honest, tasty grub for a very fair price,  you could do a lot worse. Beats going to a McDonald's."
ChIJS8g2_QKIQQ0RsbTiJzx4zR0,5,Perfect... No more words
ChIJS8g2_QKIQQ0RsbTiJzx4zR0,3,"I found it by chance and then I saw that it has a good rating on Google. My experience was that I ordered the Castilian soup and it was very salty. And then the salad that accompanied the cachopo had hair on it and the waiter saw it and changed it quickly. It was already lined up and it's a little salty to my liking. Well, conclusion, the cachopo was delicious but as I mentioned there are things that should be taken more care of because the menu cost ‚Ç¨13, the most expensive I've tried in the area so far."
ChIJS8g2_QKIQQ0RsbTiJzx4zR0,5,"They had recommended it to me as the best in the neighborhood and they were not wrong. A wonderful homemade neighborhood Asturian menu, cooked like at home, and that's how you feel when you go. Very attentive and close service, you feel at home. Incredible that cachopo is included on the menu, one of the best I have ever tried. Lots of variety and the same ideal menu every day of the week. For ‚Ç¨12.50 it is very very good."
ChIJJQQSlAKIQQ0ROmJ27h7O40U,1,"Food not too bad but the aggressive rudeness of the waiters is breathtaking and the wait between 1st course and 2nd course over an hour. Steak arrived and it was literally inedible.  Staff seemed angry, overworked and unhappy.  Really regret eating here and not cheap either."
ChIJJQQSlAKIQQ0ROmJ27h7O40U,1,"We ordered through the just Eat app, at 4:30 p.m. and it's 6:30 p.m. we called the number there and they didn't pick it up after making calls through two phone numbers. For ‚Ç¨36 of shit plus ‚Ç¨1.99 shipping then after all they pick up and take my call and we complain they tell me that the delivery man was not there yet we also complained about the application and they told us that it didn't take 30 more minutes and after I see that I just eat 2 hours after ordering the food that will even arrive cold they take me and I answer wrong because I answered wrong because of the 2 hour anger they pick up and say that I am rude when they are the ones irresponsible for not calling when they see that the order is not picked up by just eat, that as soon as they have the order they call if no delivery person picks it up and they notify me that I have to call 5 times for them to pick up a damn phone, I have a business and I have worked in hospitality to tell me how the environment in hospitality is going, learn how to run a restaurant and manage time and customer service on top of a bland taste, and semi cold"
ChIJJQQSlAKIQQ0ROmJ27h7O40U,1,"You ask if they have a menu and they say yes.
They give you the drink...
The black beans, rice, meat and salad take 20 minutes to come out.
You finish eating and order coffee but the ""Menu"" DOES NOT INCLUDE IT.
When you ask to be charged, mark food plus Coca-Cola ‚Ç¨12.50 at the register.

The ""Menu"" of this restaurant is something else, although they call it Menu..."
ChIJJQQSlAKIQQ0ROmJ27h7O40U,1,I HAVE ORDERED AND I LIKED THEM BUT THIS IS THE 3 TIME I HAVE ORDERED THROUGH UBER BUT WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT IN ONE OF THE TRAYS IT CAME LLEEEEEEENAAAAA FROM BOFE üòë....A DRY BOFE THE CHICHARRON GOOD. ON THE OTHER TRAY THE CHICKEN CAME MORE WITH BONE THAT WITH MEAT IS A PAIN BECAUSE THE OTHER TWO TIMES THE FOOD WAS IN CONDITION....BUT PAYING ‚Ç¨22 FOR THIS IS NOT WORTH IT AND 1 LONGANIZED AND A CACHITO THAT WAS WHAT WAS INSIDE AND DRYER THAN ANYTHING ELSE..LOOK AT THE PHOTOS I WON'T ORDER AGAIN.
ChIJJQQSlAKIQQ0ROmJ27h7O40U,5,"I totally recommend this place for Latin (Dominican) food, the place is clean, the service is great and the food is spectacular."

ChIJH7zJER6IQQ0RnVE97pQGT3I,2,"The food was really delicious, the chopitos were great, but the waitress at the bar was rude and the waiter was even worse, an unfunny comedian, and my husband asked him where we could sit and he responded ‚Äúin a chair‚Äù with that disgusted face on his face, well, at that moment I would have said ‚Äúcome on bye bye‚Äù it will be for bars‚Ä¶. Let's go and I had the misfortune of having to visit the bathroom ü§¢ how fenced! Dirty, it smelled terrible‚Ä¶ come on, it's a good, good filth‚Ä¶. In short, I will not return even tied, nor do I recommend it. It will be for bars."
ChIJH7zJER6IQQ0RnVE97pQGT3I,1,"Terrible, getting worse. Bar with two customers inside, I sit on the terrace (which was completely empty) and they tell me that I have to go inside to order the drink. The laziest waitress I've ever seen.
He doesn't want to go out to the terrace because it's warmer inside. Like the salary you get for doing nothing.
On other occasions the service is terrible, they take as long as they want to serve you, to bring you drinks, in everything.
Not recommended."
ChIJBwPVoISJQQ0R8ru0SIsHeRs,5,Love the place and the food. We ended up here by mistake and needed lunch. Dakitos was worth the whole detour. Friendly staff too.
ChIJBwPVoISJQQ0R8ru0SIsHeRs,5,The food here is 100% worth the visit. The cachapa and the pabellon are flavorful and homey. The atmosphere was very welcoming. Do yourself a favor and check them out :)

ChIJk_aJtgOIQQ0RV0ORbgBID1M,1,"We bought a roast chicken, he barely added any broth to the container and when we asked him if he could add a little more, he rudely replied that there wasn't any. We tried the chicken and it was dry. If there was no broth he could have offered some compensation, since if his main business product is chicken, it leaves a lot to be desired."
ChIJk_aJtgOIQQ0RV0ORbgBID1M,5,"I have been buying roast chickens here for many years and I have never had any problems and they are very good.
Also croquettes and potatoes.
For me the best in the neighborhood"

ChIJjdnDsByJQQ0RPQL74aX-Jr8,1,"Terrible service, more than half an hour waiting for a single kebap and they don't understand our language well.
I recommend going to the one on Higueras Street, delicious and in three minutes I had the kebap."
ChIJjdnDsByJQQ0RPQL74aX-Jr8,1,"The worst experience I have ever had at a kebab I went for the Thursday promo and I stayed just to see how he prepared it and I saw that he didn't chop the meat right away and he used a fingernail that he had on a plate and what he did was put it in In the bus he wanted to reheat the food in my face until I told him, I would never go again"

ChIJAQLWhWqJQQ0R0HmS0hlEpJc,1,"I am writing this right now sitting outside the establishment, we arrived at 11:45 to order food, the manager asked us to choose the takeaway option, which I clearly agreed to do. I take my order and after that I sit in front of the establishment on a bench to eat since I couldn't do it inside the establishment while it was open, a group of boys came in and sat down to eat inside the establishment, without telling them that they had to leave as they had done to us, it seems disastrous to me."
ChIJAQLWhWqJQQ0R0HmS0hlEpJc,1,"I was there a few minutes ago, I placed my usual order but this time the burger had a different flavor, I don't know why and it's the first time that happens to me, I usually go to a lot of burgers and the potato without any salt. And well, I already had to eat it because I was hungry, I had no choice."

The quality of the dishes is good and the quantity in almost all of them is more than enough. We tried the ribs, the entrail, the Milanese and the two hamburgers and for starters we ordered broken eggs with carabinero and Russian salad.

If the prices improved it could be a regular option"
ChIJBZLq61uJQQ0RZOEDbC_8t20,4,"Quiet restaurant, with good food and good service.

We went to dinner at this restaurant with easy access also for people with reduced mobility. The interior is pleasant, with cozy lighting and good service from the waiters.

The food is good, with normal sized portions and good presentation.

It is a pleasant place to go as a couple or as a group of friends, with a terrace that is sure to be enjoyed when the weather is good.

Recommended in the area, although its price is not low, it is definitely worth visiting and enjoying it."
ChIJBZLq61uJQQ0RZOEDbC_8t20,5,"Excellent site! I went to breakfast with my daughter! The place and the atmosphere are excellent!!!
The service too! The most delicious coffee in the neighborhood, a very delicious squeeze!!!!!
And we ate some eggs and ham that were a little salty for my taste! But abundant and with 2 very delicious slices of bread and everything tasty!!
We will repeat and continue trying the menu!!"
ChIJBZLq61uJQQ0RZOEDbC_8t20,4,"With a long way to go, it is clear that they want to be a reference in the area, but they are far away. The quality-price ratio is very unbalanced, croquettes a little cold, the meat just right, the artichokes hard and in which, here, the Iberian ham stands out. The desserts, in our case, torrija, too cloying with the dulce de leche. As I said, good luck, and continue along that path, containing prices as much as possible. The neighborhood will thank you."
ChIJBZLq61uJQQ0RZOEDbC_8t20,3,"I went for a snack with a friend, the place is very nice, the food is good and well priced. Quiet atmosphere, it is also true that there were few people at the time we went. The service is very slow, but slower to deliver the bill as we have asked for it three times and 15 minutes later they brought it to us. If on a Thursday on a winter afternoon and they are almost empty they go this slow I can't imagine a summer weekend."
ChIJ86xiiTEnQg0Rlh7oucgMCiA,4,"Great food with big servings so great value for money. Service was a little slow, but staff are friendly :) Recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a reaaally great heavy meal. Will definitely come back."
ChIJ86xiiTEnQg0Rlh7oucgMCiA,5,Genial!
ChIJ86xiiTEnQg0Rlh7oucgMCiA,5,"Fast sevice, tasty meat, but rise is terrible"
ChIJ86xiiTEnQg0Rlh7oucgMCiA,5,"My friend took me to this place, because it was the first time and he was delighted. The food is delicious and the portions are absolutely amazing. I have been delighted. The quality - price is something else. Excellent site"
ChIJ86xiiTEnQg0Rlh7oucgMCiA,5,"Being in the neighborhood I had never been and I already feel it. Thank you very much because I literally felt like my mother had cooked for me and that...doesn't happen everywhere. The chicken and potatoes were excellent, but seeing what was in the rice with beans conquered me...We will see each other again soon."
ChIJFbWKwRaIQQ0R98s9qnjcky0,5,"The portion was big for 3 people, plus they cooked a little extra for my 2 yr old. Lots of seafood. Loved it.. would recommend it. The chef was friendly"
ChIJFbWKwRaIQQ0R98s9qnjcky0,3,"I found the paella unimpressive, and I didn't enjoy being a sardine at this place. It's very busy and the staff are friendly, just not for me."
ChIJFbWKwRaIQQ0R98s9qnjcky0,4,A delicious experience! The rice shop offers a variety of rice dishes that are simply spectacular. The flavor is authentic. The atmosphere is cozy and the service is friendly. Perfect to enjoy with family or friends. I will definitely come back!
ChIJFbWKwRaIQQ0R98s9qnjcky0,5,"Rice and spectacular service.
My mother and I went to eat and we had rice with carabineros, the waiter was super nice and attentive and the rice was delicious, with a lot of flavor, it came with a good amount: carabineros, shrimp, chirlas, shrimp...
To say the least, the place is small and full of retirees drinking vermouth, somewhat noisy.
What is certain is that we will return or opt for pick-up."
ChIJFbWKwRaIQQ0R98s9qnjcky0,5,"Delicious!!! We ate 10! The rice is delicious!
Very friendly and pleasant staff.
You have to go try it. :)"
ChIJffczXg6IQQ0RhFyYtJi9Hck,5,The best cheesecake in the world
ChIJffczXg6IQQ0RhFyYtJi9Hck,5,"If you are going to the zoo as a tourist, please go here after! Amazing place with great food, reasonably priced and a lovely location looking over a local square. Much more authentic Madrid!!"
ChIJffczXg6IQQ0RhFyYtJi9Hck,5,"Perfect place to visit after Zoo, they have IPA beer, tasty antercot and even  gaspatcho"
ChIJffczXg6IQQ0RhFyYtJi9Hck,3,"A satisfactory place to go for a quick (pretty tasty) burger. I went here for lunch and had some potatoes aioli to share (don't know if this is the norm, but they were cold) with some burgers afterwards. The burgers are actually pretty good. Your typical homemade burger. They come with some toothpick-like chips (not a lot). I would say I was pretty satisfied with the quantity in the end. Moderately priced. What I didn't really like was the crowd. I didn't really feel welcome. It seemed like the place was quite local, to the point that it's odd if anyone new comes in. No one was rude or anything but I can say that we left as soon as we ate. I wouldn't go here for more than a quick bite."
ChIJffczXg6IQQ0RhFyYtJi9Hck,4,"Seems to be a very local bar, catering to neighborhood residents. As newcomers we were looked at strangely while entering and placing orders at the bar, which was slightly uncomfortable but then we felt good after settling down.
There was a very courteous service and the the nubes de pollo we had alongside the drink was a little not fresh enough. Overall a good place if you are visiting the casa de Campo surrounding area."
ChIJ_aDcVg-IQQ0RlBQBlLZ2ilI,5,Very good local place nice people good food and drink to enjoy
ChIJ_aDcVg-IQQ0RlBQBlLZ2ilI,5,"The service, quality and price are hard to come by in Madrid. If you want a truly barrio-feel in Madrid, go to Nabor. I love that you can order a tinto con casera and they bring the whole bottle of wine included in their daily fixed menu. I will definitely go back."
ChIJ_aDcVg-IQQ0RlBQBlLZ2ilI,5,I love having a coffee here in the morning sunshine
ChIJ_aDcVg-IQQ0RlBQBlLZ2ilI,5,Nice place good atendance love it
ChIJ_aDcVg-IQQ0RlBQBlLZ2ilI,4,"Simple but very good place. Rich delicious breakfast and the extraordinary potato omelette. We took some sandwiches to eat at the zoo and they were very, very good. Very friendly too."
ChIJPcQk0E0nQg0R6MhCkG2AN5c,1,We have not received our order and they have ignored us
ChIJPcQk0E0nQg0R6MhCkG2AN5c,1,"Delicious kebab, nothing delicious, cold, strange texture and bad sauces, they offered 2 kebabs, 4 wings, potatoes and 2 drinks, they only gave me 2 wings, also cold, music not appropriate for the place."

ChIJD2HTnfgnQg0RbVVctoeQ54c,5,A good place to have a coffee or breakfast. The very attentive and kind man is a quiet place.
ChIJD2HTnfgnQg0RbVVctoeQ54c,5,"The burgers are the best I've ever had, they have a very cheap offer that includes a drink, without a doubt the best burgers around."
ChIJD2HTnfgnQg0RbVVctoeQ54c,5,The best Migas and porridge in Madrid.

ChIJPYSLpBeIQQ0RXTEZ3IDwVjE,5,
ChIJPYSLpBeIQQ0RXTEZ3IDwVjE,5,"Fantastic menu for ‚Ç¨13, the mushrooms with the parmentier-style mashed potatoes were great and the fish stew was a main course. Dessert, bread and drinks included.

PS: I have seen bad reviews for not allowing dogs. I sat with mine at an open terrace table near the bar, not the furthest ones, and they haven't given me any problems. I recommend that the bar now allows dogs to enter any indoor or outdoor table, times have changed and they will win since now in Madrid there are more families with dogs than with children under 15 years of age."
ChIJPYSLpBeIQQ0RXTEZ3IDwVjE,5,"Usual breakfast of coffee with milk and baguette with ham and tomato, with olive oil.
Very friendly and very rich breakfast."
ChIJ8xphZyEnQg0R4eYbHXZFAF8,5,"the best Arabic food in Madrid, I always go to the Albacete branch or order delivery when I can't go and either way the food is incredible, it always arrives hot! The staff is friendly. It's my favorite place.

My favorite is the falafel shawarma with extra tabbouleh, very top!"
ChIJ8xphZyEnQg0R4eYbHXZFAF8,5,"I loved it!! When I saw that they were in my neighborhood, I ordered the mixed tray and everything was delicious. If you like Lebanese food, you will love this. It's been a long time since I've had such good falafel, not the weird mix I've tried elsewhere. Happy to have them in the neighborhood, they remind me of my city where I ate the best shawarmas ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJ8xphZyEnQg0R4eYbHXZFAF8,5,"Everything we ordered was very delicious, they arrived quickly and with the food hot.
Very rich and juicy falafel."
ChIJ8xphZyEnQg0R4eYbHXZFAF8,5,Plato Liban√©s + raci√≥n de kebah + patatas fritas. Todo muy sabroso. Recomendable.
ChIJ8xphZyEnQg0R4eYbHXZFAF8,3,"Delivery needs to improve times but very good quality of food, very good quantity and reasonable price."
ChIJGVmWvJgnQg0RcNl-d0HfIJo,5,"Came here during the last day of the San Ysidro Festival and was not disappointed. The staff were young but very professional and we started with the patacones con queso. I was very pleased when they confirmed my request for a ""refajo"" which paired well with the salchipappas personal I ordered. To top it off, they played several Marc Anthony songs while we dined. Loved the whole experience!!!"
ChIJGVmWvJgnQg0RcNl-d0HfIJo,5,Great place to enjoy the best of Colombian street food! Delicious burgers and amazing service! Thanks Julian for your amazing service üòä Looking forward to visit again soon ü´∂üèº

Grand√≠simo descubrimiento en este restaurante colombiano donde puedes degustar una amplia variedad de platos t√≠picos de la gastronom√≠a del pa√≠s. üá®üá¥

Quedamos gratamente sorprendidos con la velocidad del servicio pero sobre todo con la calidad de los alimentos. El patacon fue sin duda lo mejor de todo, aunque tambi√©n pedimos las patatas completas y la arepa mixta.

Sin duda alguna volveremos a probar platos nuevos y a pedir de nuevo aquellos que tanto nos han gustado en esta primera ocasi√≥n.

Experiencia muy recomendable y bastante satisfactoria."
ChIJSVlYIQKIQQ0RwWhOF1_TVgY,5,Great place to have a few beers or have breakfast. Good menu. The treatment is excellent and so is the quality.
ChIJSVlYIQKIQQ0RwWhOF1_TVgY,5,"Good breakfasts, good portions, drinks at the correct temperature. They have placed high tables outside the premises, on the sidewalk, which in the absence of a terrace, is worth the same."
ChIJSVlYIQKIQQ0RwWhOF1_TVgY,1,"A colleague and I ordered 2 Coca-Colas and they didn't give us any tapas and all the people who came in to have a drink, all with their tapas.
.the cover is not mandatory but put some and not others,
feel bad"
ChIJSVlYIQKIQQ0RwWhOF1_TVgY,5,"Good waiter and good cook, very nice Mirilla and Antonio ‚ù§"
ChIJSVlYIQKIQQ0RwWhOF1_TVgY,5,"The staff was very friendly, especially my friend Antonio... üëç"
ChIJQbaL6RSJQQ0R8H58JrVMp1g,5,"Delicious food authentic Latin fast food! A restaurant with the 3Bs! (Good, nice and cheap)"
ChIJQbaL6RSJQQ0R8H58JrVMp1g,5,"Today I was given to try one of the most delicious things that can exist in this World... Pandebono Waffles!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
They have become Creators of Paradises in my Taste Buds.....
The Empanadas are also delicious....
By the way.... a very delicious coffee too"
ChIJQbaL6RSJQQ0R8H58JrVMp1g,5,Today we were attracted by the pandebono waffle and the truth is that we left there very happy for the excellent food and service. I recommend the place if you want to enjoy a piece of Colombian paradise in Madrid.
ChIJQbaL6RSJQQ0R8H58JrVMp1g,5,"Spectacular, a place with good service, it is to return, thank you very much..."
ChIJQbaL6RSJQQ0R8H58JrVMp1g,5,100% recommended. Good food and good service.
ChIJIeu0PPonQg0Rt2jceZG6pfA,1,"One of the most expensive places in the neighborhood. I went with my girlfriend, 3 vermouths (‚Ç¨5.5 each, in a tube glass) and a portion of salad that was not bad, ‚Ç¨10. We had the joke of having the vermouth for ‚Ç¨30. In a neighborhood bar, and for the quality they provide, it seems like an excessive price to me. Let them get off the vine"
ChIJIeu0PPonQg0Rt2jceZG6pfA,1,"The owner is pleasant and eager to talk and be a good guitarist. Very expensive, dirty, cold, we went for breakfast with 2 adults and a child and we will not return"
ChIJIeu0PPonQg0Rt2jceZG6pfA,1,‚Ç¨5.80 for a horrible coffee and the best tortilla skewer. It smells dirty. It's a real shame.
ChIJIeu0PPonQg0Rt2jceZG6pfA,1,Zero Coca Cola and dried tortilla skewer reheated in the microwave 8 euros... the man playing the guitar while the skewer is cooked in the microwave and telling me little waiter stories while I try to be calm for a while trying to avoid the conversation... a real luxury I recommend it... üëç
ChIJIeu0PPonQg0Rt2jceZG6pfA,1,"Painful. 12.30 in the morning, empty terrace and not cleaned. The waiter doesn't come out to take our orders, I go in, I order my drink, he offers me a tortilla skewer (tiny, in one bite). I ask him to serve it on the terrace but he gives it to me so I can take it out of the establishment to the terrace. To all this the interior of the bar with only 2 customers and the waiter playing a guitar. I take the drink and the brief pincho....and surprise....I also have to go in again to pay....3.30 for a third and the mini pincho that I charge. The usual price is 2.70 with skewer included.
The waiter continues playing the guitar.
I won't go back, but it felt like a real joke."
ChIJg7xRxPsnQg0R2eYw8QxlnaE,5,"If you have heard about the Spanish empanadas, here you have the place with the yummiest ones and with the best choices depending on your taste. From octopus to chorizo. Don't hesitate yo visit and order to take away this delicious Spanish dish."
ChIJg7xRxPsnQg0R2eYw8QxlnaE,3,"Nice deserts, fair price. And Gema is one of a kind: she‚Äôs truly welcoming and gentle."
ChIJg7xRxPsnQg0R2eYw8QxlnaE,5,"Zabala Empanadas is the loveliest pie bakery! The place, and the employees seem not to have changed in the last 40 years and i loved it!

One small (peque√±a) empanada will fill two to three people and cost between two and five euros. There are three crusts and all kinds of fillings. The ""beauty of the North"" is a kind of a tuna, though the saleslady told me i should just as well have the regular tuna which is a lot cheaper!

While most buy to take home, we had our pies inside Zabala. There are a few chairs, no napkins, zero tables and nothing to cut your pie with. Good thing i carry a spoon :)

Zabala may be a bit off your road, but well worth the visit. Oh, and prepare to communicate in Spanish and handwaving only!"
ChIJg7xRxPsnQg0R2eYw8QxlnaE,5,"Nice place, cheap, homemade quality empanadas try their tuna/atun variety"
ChIJg7xRxPsnQg0R2eYw8QxlnaE,5,Long queues because what they sell is so good
ChIJfU0D-_cnQg0R3EH1E2VrgQI,5,What a gem! By far the place with the best service in Lucero. The food is exquisite and the portions are generous. My favourites are the cocktails and the desserts! It‚Äôs definitely the place to go for the daily menu but also if you fancy something special. The owner and the staff are very friendly and welcoming and the bar is extremely well looked after. We can‚Äôt wait to be surprised again with one of their suggestions!
ChIJfU0D-_cnQg0R3EH1E2VrgQI,5,Great place for tapas. Next weekend we will have Sunday lunch there so will update my review. It was the following Saturday that we did lunch for 5 people here. Alot of variety and great service and very helpful with our gluten free requirements
ChIJfU0D-_cnQg0R3EH1E2VrgQI,5,Neighborhood bar at great prices. Play park is next to it so great for a relaxed bite to eat and drink while the kids have a run about
ChIJfU0D-_cnQg0R3EH1E2VrgQI,5,Very good food with great cofee
ChIJfU0D-_cnQg0R3EH1E2VrgQI,4,Good service and good food-price ratio in the neighborhood on their terrace.
ChIJ52qrJf8nQg0RJv6fMdh4gT0,5,Fantastic site. The waitress Maria Jos√© was charming and very efficient. The Head of Room Juan is magnificent. We had friends for dinner and the food was great and the service was very fast. A very pleasant atmosphere with high quality live entertainment. We will return without a doubt. Highly recommended.
ChIJ52qrJf8nQg0RJv6fMdh4gT0,5,"I came to celebrate my birthday, and I had a GREAT time. Everything was perfect and the waiter Eduardo was 10. Highly recommended place"
ChIJ52qrJf8nQg0RJv6fMdh4gT0,5,"Starting with the attention of all the staff 10/10 and continuing with the atmosphere and the service provided, super comfortable, it couldn't have been better, I will return, I recommend it with closed eyes"
ChIJ52qrJf8nQg0RJv6fMdh4gT0,5,"Delicious food and great atmosphere, I highly recommend."
ChIJ52qrJf8nQg0RJv6fMdh4gT0,5,"Traditional chicken roaster, good product and good prices. I love shopping here"
ChIJtUKBNgAnQg0RT9E98oF0HhE,5,"Next door from our airbnb, we were very pleased to eat here! The dough was thin, crispy and very tasty. Fresh basilicum. I had the vegetarian and my son the prosciutto. Yum yum! We also tried the 'rice balls' with meat and chicken, a self-created recipe from the chef: great too!!"
ChIJtUKBNgAnQg0RT9E98oF0HhE,5,"Fusione Siciliana was an excellent experience. The pizza was delicious, with a thin, crispy crust and fresh ingredients. We tried several pizzas all of them were full of flavor. The service was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy and welcoming. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back. Highly recommended if you‚Äôre a true pizza lover."
ChIJtUKBNgAnQg0RT9E98oF0HhE,5,"THESE ARE REAL PIZZAS.
We have ordered a VOLCANO pizza, it is FLAMBEED, it must be a spectacle at night, it is a double black dough pizza (charcoal) with abundant filling of mozzarella cheese, spicy chorizo, tomato, pistachio drizzled on top abundantly, they give you a spicy abandero honey that makes the pizza more special, it is in its perfect touch of spiciness. We also ordered an Arancini, good meat filling. The service is very personalized, the waitress and the chef are excellent, it is a place to repeat as many times as you want, the service and the food combine very well, they have a children's menu, Italian desserts, shots of limoncello and sambuca, Peroni beer (Italian) and Mahou. It is to repeat."
ChIJtUKBNgAnQg0RT9E98oF0HhE,5,"Brutal. The pizza is very very good, you can see the art of Antonino the pizzaiolo and the quality of the ingredients. Perfect dough and fior di latte. But also the arancini and canoli are better than any I have tried in Sicily. Karen's attention was great. Top"
ChIJtUKBNgAnQg0RT9E98oF0HhE,5,"Today I had the pleasure of trying a new Italian restaurant that just opened, and I have to say it was a fantastic experience! My friends and I savored typical Sicilian dishes, prepared with very fresh, high-quality ingredients. I highly recommend stopping by to enjoy Sicilian delicacies in such a warm and genuine environment!"
ChIJ2Q-x0_snQg0R2kGi2Dob3pQ,5,"Amazing food, amazing service. Staff was friendly and amiable."
ChIJ2Q-x0_snQg0R2kGi2Dob3pQ,5,Great food and great service! Perfect local spirit.
ChIJ2Q-x0_snQg0R2kGi2Dob3pQ,5,"In our table we had ordered the squid, the grilled pulpo and the hamburger! Everything was amazing in terms of quality but the pulpo was the best!
We came back another day and had the meat plate - also a generous portion and delicious! I can only recommend üôÉ"
ChIJ2Q-x0_snQg0R2kGi2Dob3pQ,4,Food was good in general. The Paella (chicken paella) was not that good. Service was very good and the atmosphere was ok
ChIJ2Q-x0_snQg0R2kGi2Dob3pQ,5,"La Ca√±ola is a bar and restaurant with incredible tapas, with paellas and meats and also some wonderful burgers, I have tried the beef one and it is incredible, they come accompanied with potatoes. They have a super quiet glazed terrace and if you go with children you are next to a playground so you can leave them there and you can enjoy!!"
ChIJS6YhNK8nQg0RPgEPuXyACCw,5,Best empanadas I have ever had! Scrumptious!!! WOW Thanks!
ChIJS6YhNK8nQg0RPgEPuXyACCw,4,Nice place in the area ‚Ä¶.
ChIJS6YhNK8nQg0RPgEPuXyACCw,5,Excellent! üòÄ
ChIJS6YhNK8nQg0RPgEPuXyACCw,5,"This morning we ate cordon blue empanadas and shredded meat with cheese! They were very plump and tasty, at a good price. Just one full, they are big... I liked it a lot.
The boy is very kind. I give him a 10"
ChIJS6YhNK8nQg0RPgEPuXyACCw,1,"Terrible customer service, terrible service to suppliers.
You know that my conclusion is not only from this time that I went to the establishment, you, when you see that the person who is there is not a customer, you quickly change your behavior. You know very well that this is the first and not the second time he has treated me this way. I like your positive view when saying that your place is full with 4 people, in fact today was the day I saw it most full as you say. Good luck to you and your ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù"
ChIJd61GeAAnQg0RiODHZ_QFEb0,5,"I wanted to thank you for the great attention and tasting of a teque√±o that they gave me to try. üëåüèæ but above all the food, it is spectacular, we took the special and traditional burger, which apart from the price was delicious. Totally recommendable the place and the food. Oh yes and don't leave without trying the empanadas with the chili sauce and the papaloca (the best without a doubt) very happy. Note that it is also cheap. I hope it continues like this. They have gained a permanent customer."
ChIJd61GeAAnQg0RiODHZ_QFEb0,3,"The food has not been bad at all in comparison to quality and price, what I honestly did not like was that the menu puts a price on the soft drink that reflects 2‚Ç¨ and according to what they charge me and I see the ticket, the price was 0.10‚Ç¨ more than what the menu said, it is not so much the extra cents that they are charging me but rather I mentioned it to the girl who served me and her attitude was to turn the screen and show me that the price was 2.10‚Ç¨ instead of ‚Ç¨2.00 that the letter reflected, not having accepted their mistake has made me not at all happy because it would be worth 0.20 cents more if, for example, ‚Ç¨1 or more whoever was wrong because they had the right amount of money and that they accused me of not wanting to pay because I got carried away by the prices on the letter, if that were my case, which it has not been. These things must be taken into account and it is very important because in a certain way you are scamming the client by wanting to show a menu with juicy prices and then in the end they are different ones."
ChIJd61GeAAnQg0RiODHZ_QFEb0,5,"I went yesterday with my roommates and we were delighted! The small but cozy place, the spectacular service and not to mention the food. We ordered a little of everything to try. The big and juicy chicken, the delicious burgers with lots of cheese, the special dog is wonderful, the Teque√±os delicious, the crispy empanadas and the fillings are delicious and what we all liked the most, which is a total marvel: the papaloca. We will definitely repeat because we loved everything, quality/price ratio 10/10"
ChIJd61GeAAnQg0RiODHZ_QFEb0,5,"Super good service and incredible food ü§§ü§§ü§§ we bought chicken, hamburgers, the dog, the teque√±os, the meat empanada and the papaloca and everything was super delicious üòã better than we imagined!!! We live in the area so we will definitely repeat ‚ú®"
ChIJd61GeAAnQg0RiODHZ_QFEb0,5,"The flavor is great, the quantity is generous and the price is crazy; a highly recommended site. The crazy potato is more than a fast food, it has everything and with very homemade sauces, I will return without hesitation."
ChIJeUjb7zMnQg0R4T0ArRkb1ow,5,"The best I ate in my life,
And the sauce is incredible,
I am already the VIP member for the times I came with Alex. This should have a Michelin star"
ChIJeUjb7zMnQg0R4T0ArRkb1ow,5,"SUPER GOOD PLACE!! Everything was great: Good atmosphere, good menu, clean, fast place and the wonderful owner. They gave us chiches at the end!!"
ChIJeUjb7zMnQg0R4T0ArRkb1ow,1,"We went to order a portion of wings and it took 30 minutes, then the waitress tried to argue with us for telling her that it was taking too long, since they changed owners or employees the experience and service have been worse, they take a long time to take the bill, prepare some simple wings and also try to argue with your customers while also being rude. The previous owners were much friendlier and everything was of better quality, I wouldn't go back again."
ChIJeUjb7zMnQg0R4T0ArRkb1ow,2,"On Sunday we went to have a Coca Cola and they gave us potatoes as an appetizer. The potatoes were full of dirty oil from the fryer. I know that appetizers are not mandatory, they put them in because they want to, but man, maybe some cleaning wouldn't hurt... for that reason it's better not to put anything in there."
ChIJeUjb7zMnQg0R4T0ArRkb1ow,5,"The best Kebab service in all of Lucero, I recommend the oven dish, it is unique in all of Madrid, it combines the kebab with potatoes, rice, salad and a layer of mozzarella cheese that gives it an indescribable touch.

The staff of ten, super low prices, cheap drinks... Terrace, unbeatable!!!! If you order a beer they give you a tapa so you can try their Kebab, unbeatable! Thank you."
ChIJr1nb9PMnQg0RZskprZdHUFA,5,"Excellent tapas restaurant! When we visited, they only had calamari or chicken wings and the calamari was super fresh and delicious! The owner is very friendly and was patient with us when we didn‚Äôt speak Spanish. Highly recommend!"
ChIJr1nb9PMnQg0RZskprZdHUFA,5,"Enjoyed it here, the wine was great and the guy running the place was good fun."
ChIJr1nb9PMnQg0RZskprZdHUFA,5,"This is quickly becoming a regular place for me and my friend. Our waitress Mariana was very nice and accommodating, gave some great reccolmmations from the menu, and we loved the drinks!"
ChIJr1nb9PMnQg0RZskprZdHUFA,5,"I visited Madrid and we found this amazing place, the food was great and the staff very nice, I fully recommend this place."
ChIJr1nb9PMnQg0RZskprZdHUFA,5,"Great food, friendly and attentive staff. We‚Äôll come back!"
ChIJa748rxUnQg0Rp9Hkc8S1G2A,5,"It has been incredible 10/10 my order was ready at the agreed time, the food was delicious and the service was very friendly, I definitely plan to order again..."

ChIJN_kMp_4nQg0R_ssHvgtt1QU,4,"Visited on February 19 at 12:30 for food. I ordered the metresa with meat. The homemade food is very good and on point. The meat lacked a little more for my taste but I guess you can ask for it more done and they will do it. It is a large proportion, with the coke I ordered it made a total of 9 euros; which I consider acceptable.
It has two levels: -1 has the bathrooms and another room for food and the ground floor because the room is small.
It is a ""neighborhood"" restaurant as they would say, the dishes are already established and are those that are available 24 hours a day. The man who served me was very polite and brought out the food quickly."
ChIJN_kMp_4nQg0R_ssHvgtt1QU,5,The best onion in the area and exceptional service. We will repeat....
ChIJN_kMp_4nQg0R_ssHvgtt1QU,5,Economical and rich.... I recommend it. There was nothing left on the plate lol. I remembered Ecuador when eating here...

ChIJZ4oaL3onQg0RS_GnsMTzT0A,5,"Good place to have a special beer in the neighborhood.

Sites like this are appreciated to enjoy from time to time.

I ordered a mahou maestro that they have on tap.
They give you appetizers for drinks you order.

Price-quality: Good

It is accessible for people with reduced mobility, and the bathroom is clean and adapted, which is appreciated, because many bars in the neighborhood are not adapted."
ChIJZ4oaL3onQg0RS_GnsMTzT0A,5,"Totally recommended! A newly opened bar with exceptional service and impressive quality tapas. The sausage portions are especially delicious, with fresh and well-selected products. Without a doubt, a perfect place to enjoy some cold beers and a cozy atmosphere. I will return without a doubt!"
ChIJZ4oaL3onQg0RS_GnsMTzT0A,5,"When I saw the ""gastrobar"" thing I thought of a working-class neighborhood in the process of gentrification like this one I thought: sure robbery. Instead I have discovered: Product quality, delicious, everything clean, excellent atmosphere and prices in line with the quality offered. Raise the level in the neighborhood."
ChIJZ4oaL3onQg0RS_GnsMTzT0A,3,"Gastrobar without kitchen? The place is pretty good, especially for a neighborhood bar. To have some pretty good beers. What seems a little confusing to me is the name gastrobar when it doesn't have a kitchen. The service could be somewhat improved, although going only once I don't have much judgment either."
ChIJ4a5DpaQnQg0R6l-sn7AZa3A,5,I loved this place! The owner is very kind and hospitable and the food is absolutely delicious. Really down to earth homestyle cooking. The menu del dia is around 10‚Ç¨ and we left totally stuffed. ü§§

Without a doubt the worst kebab I have ever eaten, it tasted like old reheated meat.
They have not told me anything about the technical problems they had.
First time and last."
ChIJCfqoOWgnQg0Rbcv08W2IvD0,5,Good kebab and the place is nice
ChIJCfqoOWgnQg0Rbcv08W2IvD0,1,"Disgusting food, I ordered two Dorum that barely had Carme and cold, I was missing a menu of wings and potatoes, it tells me that my house is very far away.
They should be reported as disgusting and scammers."

ChIJv_GXTKMnQg0RdgS-gRH-UDw,5,"I arrived at this place by chance, how lucky, and we bought some empanadas and a chicken to take away. The empanadas were very good and the chicken was juicy and had a very good flavor, delicious with sauce and chili and potatoes, the 5-star service was very friendly. Despite the distance I will return for sure."
ChIJv_GXTKMnQg0RdgS-gRH-UDw,5,"A total delight. The charcoal chicken is spectacular: juicy, tasty and with that smoky flavor that makes you fall in love. The potatoes and salad are also delicious, all very well prepared. The attention of the employees is excellent, always friendly and with a smile. The prices are fair for the quality they offer. Without a doubt, a place I would always return to. Thank you for such good service!
I called and they didn't pick up the phone!!!
They immediately returned the call
The shop assistant. I didn't know his name
But his sea-colored eyes
They make me remember how attentive and professional she is with customer service, she is amazing.
Advisable"
ChIJv_GXTKMnQg0RdgS-gRH-UDw,1,"The truth is that it is the worst chicken that I have ever been able to buy, and it has nothing in XL, the chicken is practically raw, some potatoes were disgusting, and the salad was not to mention completely damaged. It was a salad that had been there for several days. I do not recommend this place at all."
ChIJv_GXTKMnQg0RdgS-gRH-UDw,5,"Whenever I feel like eating Roasted Chicken, I don't hesitate to buy it here ""Asador de Pollos X"". The truth is that they are very rich in flavor and the chickens are truly large in size. In addition, the attention of its staff is very careful. 10/10."
ChIJsVDk6tYnQg0RLLLuhdDt1qs,1,We bought chicken and some other things and we got sick.
ChIJsVDk6tYnQg0RLLLuhdDt1qs,1,I put all the argy food to the trash bin
ChIJsVDk6tYnQg0RLLLuhdDt1qs,1,"First of all, I would like to comment that the saleswoman is very rude. Yesterday I had a to good to go, and the quantity is not even for one person, the rolls are hard and empty inside, we are going to throw away, they gave us meat stew and it had potatoes and carrots in a tasteless broth but there was no meat, we are going to throw away. He also gave us two green peppers that tasted like fritanga, anything but pepper, and finally a 3 ""delights"" rice that was soggy and sticky, without flavor, and one of the ""delights"" was sausages. Who puts sausages on rice? Totally, everything to throw away. That's why she did it because it saves me money and the trip. Not recommended."
ChIJsVDk6tYnQg0RLLLuhdDt1qs,5,I had their paella and I really liked it. The service was also very good. The food overall looked very appetizing.

ChIJ-VCRjOQnQg0RNbr1RpbhZiI,5,"This is very good pizza. This is perhaps one of the best Neapolitan style pizzas. We have been multiple times on our visit to Madrid, rushing over after meals at other ‚Äúfamous‚Äù restaurants in Madrid, just to have more before they close or sneaking it in before a late dinner.

We have traveled and lived around the world and had Neapolitan pizza from the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù places, the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù chefs and the ‚Äúfamous‚Äùspots with the Neapolitan seals of approval multiple times. This is equal to any of those if not better.

We have had it when they were very busy and had it not rushed. The quality is good each time.

We have watched them make the pizzas; cleaning the prep area each time and seen their proofing boxes with the dough made from scratch, the high quality tomatoes and even sampled the salami from the owners.

Dani and Carlos are friendly to everyone from delivery workers to tourists hanging out and waiting for their pizza.

They work and understand their pizza ovens knowing exactly how to bake and finish, understanding the hot spots. This is far from mass produced food service pizza.

It is just down the river from the Royal Palace and a great reason to walk down the water."

We ordered ear with chickpeas which were exquisite and for the main course a roast lacon with potatoes was delicious! And to top it off, some homemade custard. Very kind attention. Without a doubt 100% recommended."
ChIJDVPA3M4nQg0RNu6ytpcWWVY,5,I have been eating here for 1 year and I assure you that until today I have no complaints. Rabin always remembers how I like kebab. Your attention and service is always the best. Highly recommended. Grace as always.
ChIJDVPA3M4nQg0RNu6ytpcWWVY,1,"It's a sewer, the napkin rings have more dirt than a bear's tail, the bathrooms are not clean. Entirely disgusting. Ideal to recommend to that acquaintance you hate so much or that relative you want to inherit from."
ChIJDVPA3M4nQg0RNu6ytpcWWVY,1,I ordered a falafel durum and I don't know what was inside but it was crumbly and disgusting. I hope I don't drink tonight
ChIJDVPA3M4nQg0RNu6ytpcWWVY,1,"One of the worst Kebabs I've ever been to, I ordered a mixed Durum and the meat that was already cut was heated in the microwave, I asked for a complete Durum and he added just a piece of tomato and all of the lettuce, I tell him if he can add a little more tomato and he'll add one more piece...
Lastly, the sauce (ketchup) for the potatoes is watery... Regrettable experience"
ChIJDVPA3M4nQg0RNu6ytpcWWVY,5,"One of the best and with the offers it has it is the best, the kebabs were brutal"
ChIJG4vhiCcnQg0RN08OZ72SaPc,5,Their vegan options were delicious and the staff were super friendly ! I definitely would recommend:)
ChIJG4vhiCcnQg0RN08OZ72SaPc,5,Rico!
ChIJG4vhiCcnQg0RN08OZ72SaPc,4,We ordered 2 vegan hand rolls and 6 regular ones. They didn't have a delivery person so they sent it to us via Uber (appreciated!). Very good vibes and dedicated. The vegan handroll was very good but I felt that it lacked cheese (whether vegan or not) and any good sauce. Very well priced.
ChIJG4vhiCcnQg0RN08OZ72SaPc,5,"Finally such a cool sushi place in the coolest neighborhood ü§© Cozy place near the Urgel metro, there are some little tables and also outside.

Good service from the nice girl who helped me and it shows that they take care of the details, even a handwritten message on the bags.

There are so many rolls that I will try more but starting with Avocado with Ebi Furai üç§ I have to say that I did not expect so many flavors in a bite like this. Ideal with cream cheese and chives and avocado on top ü•ë but they have many exotic creations even Sushi Burgers.

A great place for sushi fans in Carabanchel üòé"
ChIJG4vhiCcnQg0RN08OZ72SaPc,5,"Excellent, 100% recommended, the staff is super attentive and friendly, good atmosphere and the food not to mention, I have ordered delivery several times and although it is good, the experience improves by coming to the premises, they have a variety on the menu and the food is very good for a good price."
ChIJv8goyiEnQg0RFMjr8P79OPM,5,How nice my visit to this restaurant was and it helped me and I recommend visiting this place
ChIJv8goyiEnQg0RFMjr8P79OPM,1,"I came without first checking the recent reviews, I just entered without thinking because I remembered it as a good place where you left satisfied in every way. I ordered a menu where first I chose teque√±os where I received 4 the size of a pre-frozen potato stick and also these had no flavor and even more so the yellow sauce had no flavor at all, the only thing that saved it was the cheese filling that they put on it. For the second I ordered a lomo saltado, where the quantity was good, with respect to the salty flavor and the dry rice as if it were reheated.
Also warn them that the natural soft drinks (passion fruit or chicha) that they include in the menus are super sweet, a dose of diabetes.
And with the dessert, I chose tres leches cake, it arrived dry like when you have it stored in the refrigerator for several days, the superficial whipped cream is hard, with that you already know that it is stored."
ChIJv8goyiEnQg0RFMjr8P79OPM,1,"I went to eat the menu after almost a year and was totally disappointed, Doromari used to be a place where you knew you would leave satisfied quality price quantity, the airport was average, the ceviche starter was a disappointment with 4 pieces of fish covered in onion and a lot of space to fill the plate that in itself the portion is already small, more than half is a problem, I will not return nor do I recommend."
ChIJv8goyiEnQg0RFMjr8P79OPM,1,"On the 24th, I went to the restaurant in advance after reserving a 3 leches cake. When it arrived at the restaurant, I explained to the waiter that one day I bought a portion of 3 leches cake and that it came out dry and not at all spongy, to which the waiter replied that it was because Since the cake is already broken, the milk evaporates and if I take a whole one, that wouldn't happen... what was my surprise in the middle of Christmas dinner, I'm going to break the cake and I find the same dry cake, not spongy, not wet at all and with two thin layers of cake, I think that for the 50 euros that the cake costs, it should be better. I don't give it zero stars because there is no option... a total fraud, not recommended."
ChIJv8goyiEnQg0RFMjr8P79OPM,4,"Peruvian/Chinese food.
I have only attended once to try and I have to admit that the staff is attentive and very diligent.
The menu has the allergens indicated but the lunch menu does not, so you have to ask/request the normal menu.
It is food with a lot of rice, soy and vegetables.
The food is good but I admit that it is not what I like the most, but it is my appreciation for my culinary tastes, that is the only reason why I do not give it 5 stars but I would recommend the place without a doubt."
ChIJWcwlNvsnQg0RMI_r0KQT9bU,5,"Awesome unique and impressed place.

It has only improved over time.

You can easily spend four or five days discovering the area but you need to be fit for it."
ChIJWcwlNvsnQg0RMI_r0KQT9bU,5,I like the coffe..! üòÅ
ChIJWcwlNvsnQg0RMI_r0KQT9bU,5,"Super friendly waitress, attentive and always with a smile.
The red wine of summer... Without words, incredible. A magical touch made him ask for the second one quickly hehe.
Delicious tapas with each round.
I repeat for sure since few bars in the neighborhood are this great!
Keep it up and don't move yet! ;)"
ChIJWcwlNvsnQg0RMI_r0KQT9bU,5,We love eating at this bar every time we visit Madrid
ChIJWcwlNvsnQg0RMI_r0KQT9bU,5,"I stopped to have a tortilla skewer and it was delicious.
Also the waiter, who I think is the owner, is very friendly."
ChIJcfGsMxsnQg0RfO8yyE3YHVI,5,"I travel to Madrid every two months and I always go, it is an excellent cafe and the quality of the products is very good and everything is always fresh, the service is very good and fast and the prices are very good if you go to Madrid you have to go and see this coffee"
ChIJcfGsMxsnQg0RfO8yyE3YHVI,1,"Terrible experiencia, me indicaron que las empanadas tardar√≠an 8 minutos y estuve esperando m√°s de 30 minutos. Al probarlas me encuentro con 2 piezas de hueso en la empanada de carne."
ChIJcfGsMxsnQg0RfO8yyE3YHVI,5,"If like me you are Italian and finding yourself in Madrid you are desperate for the quality of coffee and breakfasts in the city, come here. Delicious coffee like at home bars and excellent desserts, chocolate bags, croissants etc.

All the staff are lovely and the coffee is from Colombia."
ChIJcfGsMxsnQg0RfO8yyE3YHVI,5,"Good find in Urgel with tables outside on the street. Very popular with the local community so service was a bit chaotic but the team were very friendly.

We tried various delicacies such as cheese fingers, empanadas, stuffed potatoes (huge), everything was very tasty."
ChIJcfGsMxsnQg0RfO8yyE3YHVI,4,A good option for breakfast and fast food. The staff is friendly and helpful.
ChIJd9QqvfInQg0R512bR989mu0,5,"El menu del dia muy bueno. Lo mejor es el trato por parte de sus dos camareros.
Volvere sin duda"
ChIJd9QqvfInQg0R512bR989mu0,5,"A cozy place with excellent service, especially the appetizers, with an interior room for any event."
ChIJd9QqvfInQg0R512bR989mu0,5,The ham toasts come well loaded but for 4 euros per toast I wouldn't expect less either.
ChIJd9QqvfInQg0R512bR989mu0,5,"Neighborhood bar with good snacks, good cuisine, pleasant staff and very nice customers. I will return, because father feels at home"
ChIJd9QqvfInQg0R512bR989mu0,5,"A very typical restaurant. Good food, very good service.
Everything tasted great and the waiter was friendly and helpful and explained all the dishes to us in a calm manner.

The prices are cheap and the quality of the raw materials is appropriate.

Was fun eating there!"
ChIJ5UAkwp8nQg0RjRaWI-Di8eo,4,Cozy and funny. Recommend.
ChIJ5UAkwp8nQg0RjRaWI-Di8eo,5,"I came to this place based on a recommendation and the truth is that it was totally worth it. Despite being somewhat far from the center, it is worth the trip.
It is a beautiful Venezuelan place with TREMENDOUS food. The atmosphere is very cool, and the staff is 10. Nice, attentive, friendly...
Moving on to the burgers... I can only say that they were delicious. With its sauces, juicy, complete... highly recommended.
On top of that super cheap. Value for money of 10. The menu is also extensive and delicious, with teque√±os, arepas, desserts...
To come and repeat."
ChIJ5UAkwp8nQg0RjRaWI-Di8eo,1,"To start, we ordered three cans and received two.
The squid sandwich that appears in the image of the app is normal, and they send a frozen squid sandwich, which also has 1/3 of the bread left over.
The potatoes come half frozen and in a paper bag that was damp and when I took it out, all the paper tore and they fell everywhere.
And the ""special"" burger, comes with medium-rare bacon and doesn't even have cheese.
When I finally manage to contact the bar, to explain everything, he only answers me, ""then talk to just eat, and they will return the money for the can"" all in a lazy and careless tone. And even less so, he apologized for a bad order and the bad experience, in fact, with all his face, he hung up the phone on me and left me with the word in my mouth. Obviously he didn't pick up the phone again.
Sad and shameful.
I don't put -3 stars because you can't."
ChIJ5UAkwp8nQg0RjRaWI-Di8eo,3,"They are no longer what they were, the Paraguayan empanadas were the flagship of this place and they no longer make them, instead they make some Colombian ones that have nothing to do with it.

The staff is good and there to have a drink but without the delicious empanadas they are no longer the same. üíî"
ChIJ5UAkwp8nQg0RjRaWI-Di8eo,5,"üìå Good service at the bar, very good coffee üëåüèº"
ChIJ3TW_XAAnQg0RxdmEMom79VQ,5,"Atmosphere like at home!!  and the food is very good, the truth is that everything is excellent, very attentive with their services, the truth is that..."
ChIJ3TW_XAAnQg0RxdmEMom79VQ,1,"More than an hour waiting for them to bring a Pepito that doesn't even come out hot and a cachapa that looks like it's from Costco, the cheese was what was good. And there weren't even people to let us wait that long, at least they should warn us that if it's going to take an hour to fill a loaf of bread to decide if it's worth staying"
ChIJ3TW_XAAnQg0RxdmEMom79VQ,5,"The delicious empanadas, the warm and homely atmosphere, the authentic Venezuelan flavor‚ù§Ô∏èüáªüá™"
ChIJ3TW_XAAnQg0RxdmEMom79VQ,5,Excelente servicio y la comida riqu√≠sima nos atendi√≥ una se√±ora que nos hizo sentir como si estuvi√©ramos en casa lo recomiendo üíØ
ChIJ3TW_XAAnQg0RxdmEMom79VQ,5,"We tried the cachapas and teque√±os. Everything delicious, I would repeat the cachapa a thousand times. A perfect deal, they make natural juice that is very suitable to your taste.
Great price quality, I would repeat."
ChIJ56_25TAnQg0RTJrbLHqBEis,3,"First time I go to this establishment using the To Good to Go app and, for ‚Ç¨5.49 euros, they gave me what is shown in the photographs.
I have missed having roast chicken, chicken wings or chicken paella, which they had less than half of."
ChIJ56_25TAnQg0RTJrbLHqBEis,1,"Completely amazing food, it's true that for ‚Ç¨4.95 you can't expect much, but if I order rice at least I ask that it's not overcooked. I don't recommend it even in a pinch, frozen pan-fried black rice is better."
ChIJ56_25TAnQg0RTJrbLHqBEis,4,"I ordered two paellas for 11 very rich people, they took them home at the agreed time, the meatballs were also very delicious, pleasant service, we will repeat, thank you"
ChIJ56_25TAnQg0RTJrbLHqBEis,5,"Today I tried the Villaroy breasts, the black rice, the tortilla, the tiger mussels and everything was delicious. Great quality. The woman who serves is very kind and friendly. We will repeat without a doubt. 100% recommended"
ChIJ56_25TAnQg0RTJrbLHqBEis,1,"3:00 p.m., a chicken roaster, without chickens, without bread, and with no intention of making more chickens. At 3:10 p.m. they can close."
ChIJRam2ZIInQg0RCPungBNtLeg,5,"I traveled to Madrid to visit the book fair and stayed in an apartment very close to this place. As soon as I went down the street I found it and decided to give it a try.
And come on, I really don't regret anything, the owner was very nice and the crumbs were good. Now, the meatballs were a spectacle, I lacked bread to continue dipping and everything, my goodness!"
ChIJRam2ZIInQg0RCPungBNtLeg,5,"This place is a danger because everything is so delicious and knowing that they do it with love. I repeat, sure, you still have to try rice."
ChIJRam2ZIInQg0RCPungBNtLeg,5,"Today I tried the chicken, rabbit with garlic, migas and empanadas. Everything was exquisite and on point. I THINK TO CONTINUE TRYING EVERYTHING. Next up, the paella that my friend who recommended this place to me says is her signature dish. What I liked most is that the food is healthy and well prepared."
ChIJRam2ZIInQg0RCPungBNtLeg,5,We went to the store to buy the chicken and we also tried the paella which was delicious!! Of course we will repeat again and again!! The customer service is unbeatable!! Congratulations to the staff!!
ChIJRam2ZIInQg0RCPungBNtLeg,5,"Super delicious food!!! Totally recommendable. The exquisite paella, the spectacular roast chicken, the meatballs in their sauce to dip bread and a long etc... Congratulations and keep up the good work!!!!!"
ChIJecUZiXQnQg0RMUQ23vEnPUE,4,"This is the brew pub of Patanel, a local craft brewery. They have five to six of their own beers on tap, plus some guest beers now and then. Among the two I've tried, the Bourbon Oak is fantastic (if you're open to unusual flavors), while the IPA is somewhere in the no man's land between hoppy and fruity. The food menu offers both comfort food (e.g. burgers, pizza) and an eclectic selection of starters. All three dishes we ordered were good, albeit not fully convincing. The cornflake-crusted cod would have been better with more teriyaki sauce. The potato casserole with cecina was a rustic pleasure, but the BBQ chicken wings somewhat lacked flavor. Our highlight was the dessert: the ""fried ice cream"", a creative interpretation of chocolate con churros, is a must."
ChIJecUZiXQnQg0RMUQ23vEnPUE,5,"Nice food and better beer. We order a pulled pork pizza and a churro desert. The pizza was really good, the churro has too much chocolate in my opinion."
ChIJecUZiXQnQg0RMUQ23vEnPUE,5,"Burgers, nachos, patatas bravas, etc ‚Äî classic pub food to accompany solid, in-house craft beer. A nice range of styles on tap; when we were there, all taps were Patanel brews + 1 Belgian extra.
Service very friendly.
Nice family vibes."
ChIJecUZiXQnQg0RMUQ23vEnPUE,5,"Great real craft beers, comfy place, very nice service."
ChIJecUZiXQnQg0RMUQ23vEnPUE,5,Great local brewery. Love the concept. Friendly staff and good service. We had two pints of the craft beer which tasted great.
ChIJH56l6sMnQg0R6zBIKkVG3Q8,4,"I liked it, but my companions were a little unhappy"
ChIJH56l6sMnQg0R6zBIKkVG3Q8,5,"We were very hungry and we found this bar which is truly fantastic, we loved the variety of dishes, a very delicious appetizer, we ordered two sandwiches and the truth is that the aioli was quite abundant, spectacular and the service much better.
We will definitely return to that beautiful Bar."
ChIJH56l6sMnQg0R6zBIKkVG3Q8,5,"We were at the San Isidro funeral home, and in order not to eat there and go for a walk, we ventured out into the neighborhood to look for any place to eat something. We came across this restaurant and rubbed our eyes when we saw the sign for the menu of the day, on a Saturday and it is a holiday. ‚Ç¨10. We think, well, by trying we don't lose anything either. First we ordered tripe with chickpeas....very good and filling. For the main course, I had bonito with tomato and my partner chicken in sauce, both well accompanied by homemade fries. Both dishes are also excellent. And to top it off, a homemade pudding is also very delicious. It's been a long time since I've seen a daily menu for that price that was so good and left so satisfied."
ChIJH56l6sMnQg0R6zBIKkVG3Q8,5,"A traditional neighborhood bar, a bar where you know where you're going to have a drink and eat portions that are quite large at a very good price. In summer they have a very nice terrace. The owners are very friendly and very attentive."
ChIJH56l6sMnQg0R6zBIKkVG3Q8,5,"We have taken two ‚Äúdon't think‚Äù menus. Excellent quality, dishes with very good presentation, unusual flavors, creative cuisine, to return without a doubt."
ChIJKc19uuonQg0RhFy9TWeEfsw,5,The best grilled chicken and biriani in Madrid!! We had it for lunch. The restaurant is opened late so we are considering to come back later on the same day.
ChIJKc19uuonQg0RhFy9TWeEfsw,5,Had some really good kebab ü•ôüëà
ChIJKc19uuonQg0RhFy9TWeEfsw,5,Nice people & good food.
ChIJKc19uuonQg0RhFy9TWeEfsw,5,The roast chicken is roasted to perfection here. We love it! And the kebabs are delicious. Yesterday I gave myself a little treat again and it made me feel great. (Meat always in good condition.) The best in the neighborhood.
ChIJKc19uuonQg0RhFy9TWeEfsw,4,Quite good Kebab compared to the rest of the establishments of this type of food. Enough quantity and cheap prices. Pleasant and fast treatment.
ChIJK_VvazcnQg0RUC-qr4VoAlc,2,"If you're a foreigner who doesn't speak good Spanish, you'll be tricked at this place.

I arrived here this afternoon. I went on to ask for the menu, the guy at the counter spoke to me very rapidly, knowing that I already showed having a hard time speaking Spanish. He briefly showed me the menu but pulled it out then offered their specialties. He suggested multitudes of things, so I settled for Tacos, Nachos and Coke. I asked for the total price after I said my order, he said to sit down and don't worry. I was sure that he told me ""5 Tacos for 5 Euros"". But I told myself if he charges me 2 for each, I'll be fine. But the Nachos costed me more than the tacos. I insisted about telling me the price but he didn't tell me anything until I finished eating. I would've said no for Tacos. I ended up paying almost 27.50‚Ç¨. Just for comparison, this is already 2 full meals in the other restaurants close here.
Lesson learned:
I wish I was more insistent in asking for the prices of the items.
I should've checked the reviews first.

I won't recommend you to eat here.

Food: 3.5/5
Place: 2/5
Service: 2/5
Price: 1/5"
ChIJK_VvazcnQg0RUC-qr4VoAlc,4,"This taco food truck is a revelation. The variety of options is impressive, from classics like carnitas and al pastor to more adventurous options like lobster tacos. The quality of the ingredients is exceptional and the flavor is authentic. Don't skip their avocado salsa! 9.5/10 recommend."
ChIJK_VvazcnQg0RUC-qr4VoAlc,5,"Found this little jem a couple minutes from our Airbnb and it was amazing! Delicious, authentic tacos with incredible service, you really feel at home! Highly recommend ü•∞"
ChIJK_VvazcnQg0RUC-qr4VoAlc,1,"I had to tell the waiter 3 times that I desired tap water, since he refused to first give it to me. Since no other customers were in the restaurant I saw absolutely no reason to refuse to give me this service.

Also, the dish was described as beans with chorizo and cheese. No info about rice. The BIG problem in my point of view is that the dish did NOT meet these properties. I received 3-4 tiny pieces of chorizo, maybe a total of 5-10g, and maybe a total of 20g beans, and maybe a total of 15g cheese. Hence this is extreme false marketing. Therefore I will never recommend this restaurant AND I cannot understand why the great reviews?"
ChIJK_VvazcnQg0RUC-qr4VoAlc,5,Superrerrr yummy food and amazing service. We were treated very well. üòä
ChIJjYJKX8wnQg0RV-btBarpixo,5,"Great quality and personalized attention. The difference with large stores is noticeable, both in the raw materials and in their preparation. It is a trustworthy store."
ChIJjYJKX8wnQg0RV-btBarpixo,1,Very bad service cold chicken and potatoes all cold I ordered a chicken legs and a drink bread and they didn't give me fries cold croquettes I got home having to heat it up for 10 minutes I couldn't return it because I don't live nearby first and last time today I bought the food very badly
ChIJjYJKX8wnQg0RV-btBarpixo,1,"I asked for chicken and they gave me salad, I wanted to meet Pollo Sancho but they told me that Sancho was not a chicken.
They gave me a stale chicken salad.
PS: I want my money hdp"
ChIJjYJKX8wnQg0RV-btBarpixo,5,"Professionalism and personality in your work. Good quality and price.
#NoMore."
ChIJjYJKX8wnQg0RV-btBarpixo,5,"Top quality chicken and turkey and excellent service
category"
ChIJx1ZK3vInQg0RRwPtTG2_7_c,5,"I have been going to this restaurant for 4 yrs, the food has always been to a high standard, as well as the service. Treated like royalty. High praise all around . üëçü•Ç"
ChIJx1ZK3vInQg0RRwPtTG2_7_c,4,Interesting and good restaurant at Carabanchel neighborhood.
ChIJx1ZK3vInQg0RRwPtTG2_7_c,5,Lo petan
ChIJx1ZK3vInQg0RRwPtTG2_7_c,5,Superior
ChIJx1ZK3vInQg0RRwPtTG2_7_c,4,"Very nice place with a bar and two table areas, one of them is very good for large groups. Tables very well set up with tablecloths, the waiters very attentive and attentive at all times. The portions are quite good in quantity and also well prepared. Just comment on the portion of octopus, in my opinion very finely chopped. They have homemade desserts."
ChIJKbRECcEnQg0RhAnIJF3jFpI,4,I liked
ChIJKbRECcEnQg0RhAnIJF3jFpI,5,"I came at noon to eat a menu of the day and the experience was perfect. I have ordered salmorejo and gilthead sea bream and the service has been unbeatable, the food was super delicious, they served me 10, quickly and kindly. The atmosphere of the place is also very pleasant.
I will return without a doubt"
ChIJKbRECcEnQg0RhAnIJF3jFpI,4,"Menu at a good price. good quality and quantity.
Latin American specialties.
Friendly and close treatment.
nice, clean and quiet place."
ChIJKbRECcEnQg0RhAnIJF3jFpI,4,The waitress we had was very attentive. It is appreciated that they have a terrace since we went with two dogs. There was a small mishap with the food but they helped us right away
ChIJKbRECcEnQg0RhAnIJF3jFpI,1,"The phone number is incorrect, they keep calling my partner to request a reservation, when he has had the same contact for 5 years"
ChIJ0ZBu49onQg0ReDVcIgsRzHQ,5,"I was warned it would be challenging to find a decent paella spot in Madrid, so I did a lot of research and locals have recommended Arroceria Imperial and it‚Äôs for good reason. The paella was really good! I wish it had a bit more socarrat and saffron that you‚Äôd expect from a great paella, but all in all it was a great experience!"
ChIJ0ZBu49onQg0ReDVcIgsRzHQ,5,"Don't be fooled by the simple appearance of this restaurant.

The food, especially the rice & fish are excellent.

I wish we had skipped lunch so that we could've tried more of what they had to offer.

If you're in the area, or in two minds about stopping by for a meal, do it.

Reservations are probably a good idea after 8:30 PM, cuz it was empty when we showed up for our reservation, but filled up fast thereafter."
ChIJ0ZBu49onQg0ReDVcIgsRzHQ,5,"My friends suggested this place to have dinner.
Though I'm not a huge fan of seafood I decided to give it a go since when these friends make a suggestion, I've not been disappointed yet hehe. And I must say - it didn't disappoint at all. I'd return gladly üôÇüëçüèª

Everything that we tried were excellent!!!
The Service was really good too, I was tempted to tip more, but apparently it's not something that's practiced much in Spanish culture. I did feel a bit guilty though hehe))  Especially since the girl and guys who attended us were friendly, very thoughtful and didn't keep us waiting long.

As for dishes, we tried several and all the dishes were excellent. The paella is really good too. I was stuffed but I couldn't stop.

Definitely recommend this place
Excellent location, very comfortable and cozy + clean venue."
ChIJ0ZBu49onQg0ReDVcIgsRzHQ,5,"Nice atmosphere, great seafood paella and kind staff."
ChIJ0ZBu49onQg0ReDVcIgsRzHQ,5,We been here for my mom's birthday. We ordered the fried seafood and arroz imperial. They all are so delicious! Thank you Hommy for giving us such an amazing service for this special day. We will come back again for sure. Don't miss this place!
ChIJzcP1A88nQg0RncFkJr9g31o,3,Food was salty. Service was trash. I ordered the lomo saltado and it was incredibly salty. The food came out quickly but not before the rude waitress.  Will not be going back to this restaurant. The prices weren‚Äôt great either. The portions were average but I‚Äôve definitely had larger.
ChIJzcP1A88nQg0RncFkJr9g31o,4,"Very spacious, with terrace outside. I had a bistec, would have to go next time to find out more plates."
ChIJzcP1A88nQg0RncFkJr9g31o,1,"It‚Äôs sad to see how a great place like this has changed for bad after changing the manager, staff is slow, rude and please don‚Äôt say anything or complain, as they will start to act as you are homophonic.  This incident took place at Paseo de las Yeserias 15

With the previous manager lady the service was excellent and fast, considerate and friendly, but after this week awful experience not a place to recommend.

I was having lunch, and after 20 min of finishing my first course, I asked for the main course, and the waiter replied that he doesn‚Äôt tolerate disrespect (asking to bring you your food ordered 30 min ago is disrespect here), what about respect for my time???, I have to return to work!  And the pace was half empty!!!

Even if the entire staff has seen that you have finished your meal, they won‚Äôt come to ask if you want something else, or if you want the bill‚Ä¶ they just don‚Äôt care to give a good service, they just gather at the bar to make jokes and gossip.

One thing is clear, most of the office people that used to come here for lunch, were no longer here, no wonder why‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt see that kind of customers, probably they lost them for the same reason.

Definitely going out of my list!"
ChIJzcP1A88nQg0RncFkJr9g31o,5,Beautiful food and great service
ChIJzcP1A88nQg0RncFkJr9g31o,4,food was authentic and delicious. good portion sizes for the prices. very pleased
ChIJNbYLEcQnQg0RovEp2PxF7OQ,5,"It is a small and cozy restaurant. I placed my order online, and for purchases over ‚Ç¨15, you have a 20% discount. Once you have made the purchase online, you can pick up your order in 30 minutes. It has been very fast. Good food, everything in order"
ChIJNbYLEcQnQg0RovEp2PxF7OQ,5,"If you are in the area and want to eat quality and affordable sushi, you have to go to Sugi Sushi. It is a small and familiar place, they cook with love and it shows.
Furthermore, everything I have tried is tremendously delicious, although I would highlight the takoyaki and the salmon rolls. Without a doubt, one of the best sushi I have ever tried."
ChIJNbYLEcQnQg0RovEp2PxF7OQ,5,"A little gem in Marquez de Vadillo, pleasantly surprised, the food very fresh and a reference, we will return üëåüèæ"
ChIJNbYLEcQnQg0RovEp2PxF7OQ,5,We ordered at home and were satisfied. The quantity and preparation is according to the price. They bring it well packaged and don't skimp on the soy sauce. The fish is fresh and the pieces are large. We will repeat.
ChIJNbYLEcQnQg0RovEp2PxF7OQ,5,"My trusted sushi in the area to order at home. The quality of the fish is good, it is well prepared and they are super fast.
If you want to order at home in the area, it is highly recommended, they have a lot of variety, including varied trays and at a good quality price."
ChIJw1mcU8UnQg0Rj0Mzf8Kkku0,5,One of those little places perfect for a mid-week getaway: a beer and some olives... Great!
ChIJw1mcU8UnQg0Rj0Mzf8Kkku0,5,"I live close by and i never been until today. Very typical bar to eat something. Clean, big portions, typical madrile√±o. Everything perfect and i highly recommend it."
ChIJw1mcU8UnQg0Rj0Mzf8Kkku0,4,Nice tapas at a reasonable price. Oreja a la plancha is a must!!
ChIJw1mcU8UnQg0Rj0Mzf8Kkku0,4,"Well priced food, the peppers and veal were especially excellent."
ChIJw1mcU8UnQg0Rj0Mzf8Kkku0,3,"I have been twice. I ate one of them from the menu and the last from the set menu. I can say that I liked the menu better. It cost only ‚Ç¨13.50. I ordered cooked and it was ok. The noodles in the soup were very soft and the broth had good flavor but was somewhat watery. The second dish had chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãthat you put in a sandwich, and it was hard. The rest of the ingredients were good. The amount they serve you is large. And the dessert was homemade. I ate a flan that was very delicious."
ChIJzYgsBtsnQg0RecjEIyYyXhk,3,"It‚Äôs a good Peruvian restaurant to try the typical dishes, they have a big variety of different plates. We had the daily menu, which was 12.5‚Ç¨, and the portions were pretty big, we had to take half home. Price/quality is well balanced. They have some other restaurants in different neighborhoods and the menu changes from one place to the other. Overall it‚Äôs a good place to try at least once. Accessibility: both restaurants I‚Äôve been to were at street level and can be accessed by wheelchair/crutches."
ChIJzYgsBtsnQg0RecjEIyYyXhk,5,"Outstanding Peruvian kinchen.
The ambient is perfect, tasty food and friendly waiters.
Katy did a great job and her recommendations were hitting the point."
ChIJzYgsBtsnQg0RecjEIyYyXhk,5,"Wonderful experience, server was very helpful with menu selection. The food was excellent with excellent value üëè. Thanks üëç"
ChIJzYgsBtsnQg0RecjEIyYyXhk,3,"Delicious food and friendly staff. I went with a group of 15 and it was well organised by the waiting staff. Unfortunately, the major downside for me was the lack of allergen information. They didn't know what was gluten free or not, and when I asked to see the ingredients of certain dishes I was told it wasn't possible because they didn't know. As a coeliac that's unacceptable for me, and I had to trust that the dishes I chose in the end really were gluten-free... Apart from that it was nice, I'd recommend it if no one in your group has dietary requirements!"
ChIJzYgsBtsnQg0RecjEIyYyXhk,5,A good option when you get tired of trying the spanish food
ChIJ8TNDwNonQg0RPe6rqFP65RM,4,Delicious and extensive range of sandwiches. Friendly service and good price.
ChIJ8TNDwNonQg0RPe6rqFP65RM,2,"1 EMPLEADA CON ACTITUD TERRIBLE! / 1 FEMALE EMPLOYEE WITH BAD ATTITUDE!

We have been customers of this Rodilla for the last 10 months and service has been fine until today (24 junio 2016). I forgot my wallet at home, so I asked my husband to bring it to me and join me for a snack. I waited a little outside of Rodilla, but then decided to go in and see what sandwiches were available so I would know what I want when my husband got there. Soon after I started looking at the sandwiches in the display case, the female employee behind the counter greeted me with ""diga"" and I explained to her in Spanish that I had not decided yet and I was waiting for my husband to come and bring my wallet. No verbal response. Not even a head shake or eye contact. Not very friendly, but there's more...

After a few minutes my husband came in with my wallet. We were originally going to go a few shops down to get a frozen yogurt at Delysium, but we saw the Helados Artesanos cart in Rodilla and decided to order from there instead. We went up to the cart and the same employee who first spoke to me was nearby so she asked what we wanted. My husband said he wasn't sure, that he was thinking for a second, to which she rolled her eyes as if we were really inconveniencing her. (There were no other customers waiting in line and only 2 customers at tables eating).

He asked for a chocolate cone, but I suggested to him he may want to try the coffee flavor since we have chocolate at home. As he thought for maybe 5 seconds, he said, no I think I will have the coffee flavor instead. To which the lady replied in a very snippy tone/nasty attitude ""well, you better decide which one you want before I put it in the cone!"" She had only partially lifted up the chocolate container out of the cart and had not even started scooping yet. She didn't even have a scoop in her hand! Wow, we were really in shock. I mean, we understand everyone has bad days, but it is so rude and disrespectful to take it out on the customers! I mean, he only took a few seconds to change his mind. Is that illegal in Rodilla? Has this employee ever been somewhere ordering something and changed her mind?

Then later as we were sitting at the table eating, my husband (a native Spanish-speaker) heard the same employee complaining about the ice cream cart even being in the store...as if it were too much work for her. Wow, with Spain's economy what it is and so many people unemployed, we were very surprised to hear someone so ungrateful and with such a terrible attitude at work, which she projects directly to customers. Even if she had not said a word the whole time, her face clearly communicated she did not want to be there. I was going to get an ice cream cone also but we decided to walk down to Delysium instead.

Unfortunately, she was not wearing a name tag where we could see her name, but she was short, a little chubby, with dark brown hair pulled back behind her head and a few freckles on her face. This employee either needs to find a job that doesn't require her interacting with customers or she needs to take a long course on customer service! If you go to this Rodilla and want to be treated nicely with respect, it may be best to avoid talking with this employee.

As a side note, one of the other female employee who took our money was nice. She was taller, thin with lighter brown hair and I actually saw her smiling. What a concept! Not sure we will be returning to this Rodilla. The one in Sol is much friendlier and they interact with many more foreigners than down in Arganzuela. What a shame."
ChIJ8TNDwNonQg0RPe6rqFP65RM,5,Cozy and have a lot of variety of tasty sandwich and drinks
ChIJ8TNDwNonQg0RPe6rqFP65RM,3,Standard. But good.
ChIJ8TNDwNonQg0RPe6rqFP65RM,5,Very fair price for the quality üëç
ChIJKwo7Rc4nQg0RVywwxj3UCU8,5,Really good reastaurant to get a quick and great pizza. And the staff is super friendly aswell
ChIJKwo7Rc4nQg0RVywwxj3UCU8,4,"They make very good pizza here, it's not very cheap though."
ChIJKwo7Rc4nQg0RVywwxj3UCU8,2,"Pizza being their branded product is really exepensive. 12 euros cheapest pizza. Quality is average and size is small. I have only gotten takaway Pizzas from here multiple times because it is close to home. Yet the Pizzas are really tasty. The place can get very crowded and too loud if you prefer a more relaxing dinner. On the other hand if you are in search of lively place, this might interest you. Check opening hours cause they are quite limited."
ChIJKwo7Rc4nQg0RVywwxj3UCU8,5,"Excellent Guacamole and Vegetarian vegetable pizza, crust was perfect!"
ChIJKwo7Rc4nQg0RVywwxj3UCU8,4,"The food is expensive, but it's worth it. Excelent quality"
ChIJ7cH1A88nQg0RfuEPdGe_BlA,5,Very nice dishes
ChIJ7cH1A88nQg0RfuEPdGe_BlA,5,"Good food, good service, a pleasant atmosphere and a reasonably priced menu. In addition to the indoor dining room, it has a good outdoor terrace. We have eaten here a couple of times and we will definitely repeat üëç"
ChIJ7cH1A88nQg0RfuEPdGe_BlA,5,"Excellent food and service, very friendly waiters, very good food, prices within what was expected for the area in which it is located, about ‚Ç¨30 per diner."
ChIJ7cH1A88nQg0RfuEPdGe_BlA,5,"It is one of the usual places where I usually go. They have renovated the place and we wanted to see it. They turned out great and the food, as always, was delicious. They have also included new dishes and it is worth going to try them. Everything homemade, the cook is a magician!!!"
ChIJ7cH1A88nQg0RfuEPdGe_BlA,3,"It is a nice place, next to Madrid R√≠o. Rich portions and good quantity. The service is a little slow, but acceptable because the staff is polite and helpful."
ChIJ3SmbZc4nQg0RlYBuPLDdOe8,5,Very tasty and good food. I Recommend it for take away .
ChIJ3SmbZc4nQg0RlYBuPLDdOe8,5,Great take away home food. Great value for money
ChIJ3SmbZc4nQg0RlYBuPLDdOe8,5,"Excellent service, extremely pleasant waiters and delicious food, ideal for meals with friends or family, totally recommended and I am convinced that I will return every Holy Monday with my friends to celebrate the beauty of life. Ten out of ten!!!"
ChIJ3SmbZc4nQg0RlYBuPLDdOe8,5,"Takeaway food, really homemade and not at all greasy. And honest prices.

We discovered it recently (maybe 2 months ago).

The chicken and ham croquettes are 10, because they are not one of those liquid ones (which haute cuisine culturets say are the good ones, fools), nor are they greasy from a shabby Madrid tavern, they are grandmother's croquettes when she cooks for small grandchildren because the ham is very minced so that the children do not choke.

The stew is a stew, served in its three parts.

And the other dishes are very delicious, like migas.

I'm looking forward to trying the roast chickens, they look great.

The atmosphere is cool, because it is very familiar, everything looks very clean and humble and honest, everything is very well cared for, they have a little table for children with stories and some toys to wait for, magazines and newspapers, and chairs for the grandparents to sit while waiting (which is not much either).

For us, going on the weekend helps us eat food that warms the heart, and you get some dishes to start with energy on Monday and the first part of the week.

I upload photos of the menu so you can see prices and schedules."
ChIJ3SmbZc4nQg0RlYBuPLDdOe8,5,"The other day I ordered a potato omelette and a spring roll at El Asador Ping and it was incredible. The omelet was just right and the spring roll was huge, so much so that one fills you up.
I will definitely return and try other new foods."
ChIJRwStb84nQg0RVaNQfoSrmwE,5,"Butchery with good professionals, and good quality goods.
They have many types of meat, pork, veal, beef, matured beef.... and chicken, free-range chicken....
They make pork and chicken sausages themselves, hamburgers of different meats, Moorish skewers...
They also have a shelf of delicatessen products."
ChIJRwStb84nQg0RVaNQfoSrmwE,3,"Marinated Iberian loin tape, saltier than the mother that gave birth to me, I will try something else, but it is clear that the Iberian loin tape leaves a lot to be desired."
ChIJRwStb84nQg0RVaNQfoSrmwE,4,"The meat is very good, pleasant service and fair price.
Thinner slices in the packages offered for sale would be better."
ChIJRwStb84nQg0RVaNQfoSrmwE,5,"I love it, if I had it next to my house it would be my trusted butcher shop. We go when we can because we love it. The genre is good but the attention is unmatched. Great professionals."
ChIJRwStb84nQg0RVaNQfoSrmwE,5,"I like it a lot. All the meat is of very good quality, and they have the detail of cleaning it well, and not leaving all the fat and nerves behind as they do in most butcher shops. Highly recommended!"
ChIJB957CN4nQg0RrC3UHDcqa6o,3,"Wait staff not super friendly with me or my kid....not responsive, not helpful, etc.
Ice cream collection pretty good in summer, but dismally in winter, even on hot sunny days....
Generally pretty chill Sunday afternoons though, and nice place to rest if your doing the whole river."
ChIJB957CN4nQg0RrC3UHDcqa6o,4,"I went to this restaurant purely because it was across the street from the hotel I was staying it (NH Ribera Del Manzanares). I looked at the reviews and they weren't great but it was in a great location and offered great views.

I'm going to break away from the other reviews and say that I rather enjoyed coming to this restaurant. My steak was tougher than beating Lion King on SEGA but I still enjoyed it because it had a great flavor. The staff was very polite, helpful, and even spoke a good bit of English (not that it would've been an issue if they didn't).

The view was excellent, the ambiance was excellent also. I came back a couple nights later just because I needed drinks. I bought a bottle of sangria and a couple of cokes. They packed them up to go and it didn't take long.

Long story short if you're stay nearby don't be afraid to stop by."
ChIJB957CN4nQg0RrC3UHDcqa6o,1,"Don‚Äôt eat here, that‚Äôs all I can say. We had  the lunch menu and what we got was some of the worst food I‚Äôve had in Spain. The beef was almost raw (we had ordered it medium) and full of fat and sinews. Even the fries were undercooked. Since the location next to the river is quite nice I would recommend just to have drinks here and nothing more."
ChIJB957CN4nQg0RrC3UHDcqa6o,1,This chiringuito is ok for a drink but the food is terrible. Undercooked pork hamburger which was sent back 3 times as it was raw in the middle. Rodaballo totally overcooked and dry and boney. Eventually we gave up and left. It‚Äôs a shame as the setting is pleasant beside the river but don‚Äôt eat there.
ChIJB957CN4nQg0RrC3UHDcqa6o,2,"A very Cold welcome
The waiter did not pay attention to us
A simple order for a cerveza was complex
Very basic food without taste
I do not recommend"
ChIJZ5l37M4nQg0RtqNlHTHCKeE,5,"We found this to be a very functional, small pool. I little slice of blue oasis in the middle of a built up area. Coming again tomorrow"
ChIJZ5l37M4nQg0RtqNlHTHCKeE,4,"Our whole life pub. Nice food, good tapas and the best service."
ChIJZ5l37M4nQg0RtqNlHTHCKeE,5,Such a good place to feel in the real Madrid!!
ChIJZ5l37M4nQg0RtqNlHTHCKeE,5,Very tasty. Very friendly
ChIJZ5l37M4nQg0RtqNlHTHCKeE,5,Good service. Friendly
ChIJEQWYsdonQg0RoG_UTtSXwYU,5,"Great chinese food, proportion was really good for its price."
ChIJEQWYsdonQg0RoG_UTtSXwYU,5,"Always a perfect spot we have been coming for more than 25 years the Peking Duck is amazing, the dumplings are just awesome. We have a little bit of everything Cantonese rice and spicy beef You will not go wrong coming here. They actually have a very nice wine selection. And a chupito de la casa is also a good bye bye treat.
We also had some Ice-cream with walnuts"
ChIJEQWYsdonQg0RoG_UTtSXwYU,5,Very enjoyable Chinese food. Recommend.
ChIJEQWYsdonQg0RoG_UTtSXwYU,5,"A nice place to enjoy a tasty lunch or dinner. Quick and friendly service, good food. Definitely to visit if you like Chinese cuisine, and happen to be in the neighborhood."
ChIJEQWYsdonQg0RoG_UTtSXwYU,5,Good Chinese food. Good service. Good decor.  Reasonable prices. Not sure why it does not show up in Google search?
ChIJ8VivnHkoQg0RsBNuyo0ZmDQ,5,"We used Acaramelada (Maria) for our wedding cake. To say she nailed the brief is an understatement - she created the most divine cake we could have hoped for. It didn‚Äôt just look spectacular, it tasted so good, I wish I could do our wedding all over again just for the cake!! I can‚Äôt recommend her and her skills enough ‚ù§Ô∏è

She‚Äôs also extremely friendly, and so easy to work with. We had previously contacted a different vendor and found them really difficult to deal with, we couldn‚Äôt get important confirmations from them and they struggled to deal with our venue. Maria made the process so easy, there were literally no hiccups at all. She handled the process end to end, and so professionally. She came highly recommended from our planners too, so we know it wasn‚Äôt a one off occasion!

Can‚Äôt recommend her and her bakery enough!"
ChIJ8VivnHkoQg0RsBNuyo0ZmDQ,5,"Fue todo un acierto confiar en Acaramelada para elaborar la tarta de nuestra boda. Cre√≥ una tarta preciosa, totalmente acorde a como nos la imaginamos y que ella misma esboz√≥ el d√≠a que nos conocimos, y que adem√°s estaba riqu√≠sima, opini√≥n que compartieron todos los invitados.
Todo el proceso fue s√∫per f√°cil, Mar√≠a Jos√© nos explic√≥ todo lo relacionado con la elaboraci√≥n y los ingredientes que usaba, y el poder probar las distintas combinaciones antes de encargarla nos ayud√≥ much√≠simo.
Sin duda es un sitio al que volveremos y que recomendamos para cualquier ocasi√≥n especial."
ChIJ8VivnHkoQg0RsBNuyo0ZmDQ,5,"I share with everyone the beautiful work they did for my wedding.
It was a surprise for the groom. He wanted a geeky wedding, and I played hard to get. He didn't know what surprises awaited him related to the Avengers. This was one of them. I loved it!! And I'll tell you the kid...
I simply asked for a table with elegance and taste but that at the same time had details from The Avengers. The truth is that they nailed it."
ChIJ8VivnHkoQg0RsBNuyo0ZmDQ,5,"Caramelada is a gem! Mar√≠a Jos√© Ad√°n Mart√≠nez created the most incredible wedding cake that perfectly embodied our vision. From the beginning, Maria understood exactly what we wanted. She quickly outlined our idea, and it was clear that she was the right person for the job. When we saw the final cake, we were blown away by its beauty: it was everything we had imagined and more. But what really made it different was how delicious it was. Our guests keep talking about her. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. I recommend Maria for any special occasion."
ChIJ8VivnHkoQg0RsBNuyo0ZmDQ,5,"The best thing for us is that we did not know what flavors to make the cake and shape, but thanks to them, the professionals, they advised us and the truth is that we were greatly surprised when we saw it, but the best thing was when we tried it with that flavor and with that super soaked cake!! WITHOUT WORDS YOU LEFT PEOPLE"
ChIJw4laBMYnQg0RZf6CQf2Ld4Q,5,"Such a lovely little place, good food and friendly staff. We ordered fish and some tapas and it was lovely."
ChIJw4laBMYnQg0RZf6CQf2Ld4Q,5,"Fantastic food , friendly service, local food  and very reasonable price !"
ChIJw4laBMYnQg0RZf6CQf2Ld4Q,5,A real gem. Don‚Äôt miss this
ChIJw4laBMYnQg0RZf6CQf2Ld4Q,5,"This restaurant was next door to our apartment and was really good. We ate here twice. We looked at the menu and started ordering lots of things as we wanted to try so much and the waitress told us to stop and order more if we wanted. We didn't. The portions were big and good! Reasonable prices and we got a free shot at the end of the meal.

We ordered battered prawns and got about 15. We ordered grilled prawns on our second trip and got the same amount. The picture posted is pigs ears. I wasn't keen bit that's just me. Calamari and potatas bravas were great"
ChIJw4laBMYnQg0RZf6CQf2Ld4Q,5,"Beautiful place. I'm taking a ""Vermut"". Here you can find several variations of Spain food.
High recommended."
ChIJ8V1cwNsnQg0RmCEHCAJvBXo,5,"Definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in Madrid. The staff are very friendly, and the food is SO GOOD. I highly recommend!!! Plus their delivery service is super fast! :D"
ChIJ8V1cwNsnQg0RmCEHCAJvBXo,4,Good. Quick. Standard. Well priced.
ChIJ8V1cwNsnQg0RmCEHCAJvBXo,2,"Good service and friendliness. The food was bland and quite average. The bad rolls, the rice with chicken and curry with a burnt flavor and the beef with oyster sauce acceptable. Price for two diners with a drink and a coffee ‚Ç¨26. No wonder!!!!"
ChIJ8V1cwNsnQg0RmCEHCAJvBXo,5,"Very good food, from different Asian countries, delicious, very subtle spices and special speed and home delivery.  They are also very friendly and always have details and they give you shrimp or Chinese bread and sometimes both."
ChIJ8V1cwNsnQg0RmCEHCAJvBXo,4,"Chinese restaurant located on the imperial walk. It has a wide variety of starter dishes, rice and noodles, meats, fish and seafood. They also have special menus for two to six people. We placed an order for two people for ‚Ç¨20.20 plus a drink and everything was very delicious. The only downside is that they took a long time although they already let us know when placing the order by phone. We will repeat for sure."
ChIJDZ0rDtonQg0R55y7YRYYO9M,5,"An amazing place for cooking with a group of children!  They were taken to the supermarket to buy ingredients, cooked entirely by themselves, and were so happy and proud with what they made!  Delicious recipes, encouraging and supportive staff made for a lovely day!"
ChIJDZ0rDtonQg0R55y7YRYYO9M,1,"The owner was on top the entire time, until he said how we had to cook the paella for a Valencian. In fact you have told us ""not to come back because the children are bothersome."" A good day with friends has become unbearable because of him. And the children have been well behaved. We've been going a few times now and we're normal people."
ChIJDZ0rDtonQg0R55y7YRYYO9M,5,"Enrique, the owner, is a peculiar guy that you have to know, we booked for a meal with friends and it is true that it got out of hand, the poor man thought that we were going to make 2 tortillas and little else and from there we started using the paella pan, the oven, the josper and all kinds of devices that the place had. I recommend this place to teach the typical food course, initiation to a pastry course or for a family event where we want to act as a cook since the place is equipped with a professional kitchen.
Very clean premises, at a competitive price and with a quiet area around it make it a total success
I will return."
ChIJDZ0rDtonQg0R55y7YRYYO9M,5,"A large professional kitchen, very well equipped, nothing is missing. Very good cleaning service, the lady very attentive. Highly recommended for group lunches and dinners. To add a drawback... I can't imagine two different groups sharing the premises..."
ChIJDZ0rDtonQg0R55y7YRYYO9M,5,"Phenomenal and recommended! We organized the surprise birthday party there and had a fantastic time! We made suckling pigs in the oven, but you can also use the barbecue or kitchen, everything is very well equipped and the service/owner are incredible! We will return and continue recommending COCINANTE!!"
ChIJBzJM2MUnQg0RjmZwI1svjIU,3,"Went for the menu del dia for 16.50‚Ç¨. Had the squid ink rice and the cod a la riojana. Taste was good, but super thirsty after. Not sure from saltiness or MSG. Had the tiramisu for dessert ü§Æ‚Ä¶ cheap store frozen box bought, not worth the calories."
ChIJBzJM2MUnQg0RjmZwI1svjIU,5,"It was the third time to visit this restaurant. All the foods and drinks were perfect this time as well.  You can't miss it when you are in Madrid!
Muchas gracias"
ChIJBzJM2MUnQg0RjmZwI1svjIU,5,"They've nice quality seafood, I like the appetizer is avocado with tomato and the mozzarella cheese on the side, such fresh!
But the lamp chop kinda disappointed to me."
ChIJBzJM2MUnQg0RjmZwI1svjIU,5,"The seafood is delicious, but it depends on your preference. The rest is as expected."
ChIJBzJM2MUnQg0RjmZwI1svjIU,5,One of the best bars/restaurants in Madrid!
ChIJ_YcxudsnQg0RKooHEq6qo-o,5,"Visited Madrid with some friends who were craving Domino's. The place was packed with people, even at 10pm. Girl working the counter did her best to accommodate our ignorance and lack of Spanish speaking skills. Good pizza!"
ChIJ_YcxudsnQg0RKooHEq6qo-o,1,"Impossible to order online as a non native (even with Spanish) without a local address. By the time we thought we'd figured it out, we placed our order, waited 40 minutes only to find out that our order had been cancelled. By this time it was too late to go out to buy food and we were left hungry.

Not as satisfying experience whatsoever."
ChIJ_YcxudsnQg0RKooHEq6qo-o,5,"Best place to eat pizza. I recommended.
Thank for loze how make our pizza"
ChIJ_YcxudsnQg0RKooHEq6qo-o,5,Sorry no pics to share! Pizza was so delicious it was devoured in seconds.
ChIJ_YcxudsnQg0RKooHEq6qo-o,4,"The best fast food pizza! This restaurant is small, but the sellers are kind. The restaurant could be cleaner, so it's only 4 stars!"
ChIJo0-XkNAnQg0RxbG7LyEHeM0,3,"They try, explanation from the waiter about the way how they are preparing chicken wings exceeded my Spanish level, but they should just grill it. Calmares also we're not on a level I am used to - one of the worst I had in my life, chewy and soft. Very nice service would make me to come there again, this time just for a drinks"
ChIJo0-XkNAnQg0RxbG7LyEHeM0,3,"A family ordered the following today. Beer-good. Garlic shrimp-tasty, small portions. Chicken wings with potato-good flavor/portions. Octopus-decent flavor, cooked well, good portions. My wife ordered ""red shrimp""-smelled very fishy and it was inedible. I smelled it and it AND SMELLED BAD. The owner argued with us and ate a piece in front of the other patrons and took my wife inside to show her a sign in Spanish which proved nothing. A local translated and said they have to freeze the stuff to keep it fresh. Totally understand, but the shrimp was bad and he tried to convince us otherwise. 3/4 dishes were ok. He did take it off our bill because we didn't eat it. Would recommend adopting ""the customer is always  right attitude"" , even with a language barrier, instead of belittling us in front of a crowd of patrons. We appreciate the overall service but this is the first time we have had to return food because it was risky as shellfish poisoning is no joke."
ChIJo0-XkNAnQg0RxbG7LyEHeM0,5,"Great neighborhood restaurant, absolutely awesome tortilla croquettes and montaditos de lomo ha e yourself some rioja and enjoy the outside"
ChIJo0-XkNAnQg0RxbG7LyEHeM0,5,"The tortilla here is fenomenal, but don't go too early as they start serving it around 11 am and no sooner. The owner is quick and friendly. If you are near Puerta de Toledo I would recommend stopping in. Great prices as well!!"
ChIJo0-XkNAnQg0RxbG7LyEHeM0,1,"Worst in Madrid so far, food with no taste whatsoever. Poor service. Worst house wine. Restaurant interior in disrepair.  Avoid if you can.  Very sad."
ChIJg1QyrMYnQg0RaASZP8uN_w0,5,"During the power outage, this was the only place open around the zone.
Providing food and drinks:
Jam√≥n ib√©rico and curated Cheese sliced in front of everyone.
Ensalada rusa - perfectly
even without energy, the beers were cold.

The food is amazing, the service is incredible and the place replicates the true self of the hispanic-Parliant culture: if we have no lights we will create it.

Astonishing place. Every time I have free time, I will definitely come back.

21:41 GMT +2 Madrid time (you can do your own time-translation you have google for it ü´†)

I've ordered the most consumed dish: Carne.

This is a must in Spain, specially in Madrid, is astonishing the way how they operate, they are so fast, so attendance, so incredibly that you will always want to me back.

Everyone from Spain who provide 4 stars : shame on you, this place is not even a 5 stars I will rate it as a ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 6* for all you, come to me, one by one: I will show you a family friendly place, where kids can standby, where pets are allowed, were the Wi-Fi is even available from the store manger though all possibilities utcomes (Apple or android, if you have blackberry or elder: go to sleep)

This place is amazing.

5 stars are not enough, for real. This place is a 6 Star, whoever does not agreed with, come to me; ask me."
ChIJg1QyrMYnQg0RaASZP8uN_w0,4,"EN: This place is really nice, the food is amazing, I came here multiple nights over two trips to the city. The quality of the food is amazing and the atmosphere is very local, nothing pretentious or ridiculous going on. They have both paper and digital menus. I never had to wait for a table and I love how you can put the last order in extremely late as well. Where they lose points is the service, one of the waitresses with her hair dyed red from the Dominican Republic tried to say she couldn't understand my Spanish when the entire country understood me, she just didnt like being asked a lot of questions. It's funny to hear her criticizing my Spanish when Dominicans are known for using slang and butchering the language anyway.
ES: Un lugar muy guey, comida rica, platos clasicos y simples, se puede comer hasta tardisimo, los meseros son mas o menos. Si puedes no te vayas con la Dominicana con pelo roja, es una payasa."
ChIJg1QyrMYnQg0RaASZP8uN_w0,5,"Food was marvelous. We took the Chulet√≥n de √Åvila, it was to die for üòã Lots of delicious food. I strongly recommend it."
ChIJg1QyrMYnQg0RaASZP8uN_w0,5,Impressive food! Chulet√≥n de Avila was the best food we've had in Madrid so far!
ChIJg1QyrMYnQg0RaASZP8uN_w0,5,Great food excellent service. Bar Hidalgo is a story of steaks and beers and men. :)
ChIJy5oHYdwnQg0RyVm3x_EHA8E,5,Amazing find! Food was delicious and their service was great! Great thing about their menu is that they could do smaller portions. Would definitely recommend their coffee too!
ChIJy5oHYdwnQg0RyVm3x_EHA8E,5,"Sandwiches were delicious, place was empty when we arrived around 1pm. Too bad they didn't have tortilla when we went."
ChIJy5oHYdwnQg0RyVm3x_EHA8E,5,"Best breakfast in Madrid. We have been in couple places and always try toast with ham. Believe me, this is the place where you want to eat."
ChIJy5oHYdwnQg0RyVm3x_EHA8E,5,"Great authentic Spanish/Venezuelan food at great prices. The owners are very hospitable and attentive, nothing was too much for them. A lovely evening sat outside eating delicious food."
ChIJy5oHYdwnQg0RyVm3x_EHA8E,5,"ü§©Wow‚Ä¶Great quality and prices ‚Ä¶.
The waiter/owner super friendly, which is very rare to find at tapas bars‚Ä¶"
ChIJqf-91dEnQg0RRoMa-co0LcQ,1,"The place seems nice but the waiting time is way too long ( waited around 45 mins for the drinks to come and then another hour for the food). The waiter was somehow non-communicative and had a relatively hard time getting to understand him.
Also, the tables were not cleaned properly and for more than 5 people they did not give us more tables."
ChIJqf-91dEnQg0RRoMa-co0LcQ,5,"Excellent friendly service and a very good variety offered on the menu.
A perfect place to stop for a coffee and pastry if you are in the area. They have a great variety of delicious teas as well .
The staff is super friendly and nice."
ChIJqf-91dEnQg0RRoMa-co0LcQ,2,"The place is nice, but the service is very very slow. We waited a long time for getting served.. also had to tell them again that we were waiting for our drinks. They did not bring the were we asked for so we had to get it ourselves and had to go to the bar to order it.. Had to wait over an hour for our food.. in the end.. we paid for our drinks and left without eating because we were to hungry to wait any longer.. (this was in the weekend, Saturday)"
ChIJqf-91dEnQg0RRoMa-co0LcQ,1,"Besides the bad serving and the long waiting time it seemed like the employees were having a weird attitude towards us as foreigners and the made us feel unwelcomed.

Another low point was the bathroom. It was small and not cleaned.

The last low point was the tip part. They expected us to leave almost 20% in tips and didn't seem to be very happy when we refused to do so."
ChIJqf-91dEnQg0RRoMa-co0LcQ,5,Rick Steves and his recommendations are always spot on. This was no exception. The Menu Del Dia was great. It‚Äôs well priced and comes with white table cloth service away from the tourist hustle of the street. Menu Del Dia starts at 1PM
ChIJqzTxM84nQg0R0tnyEum8swE,5,"Every time I go to Jamoncito de Arganzuela!!! I enjoy it, first setting up the window and then looking at it without knowing what to choose to take, the decoration is very cozy and let's not talk about its products, everything from the charcuterie, savory products, bread or cookies, oils,‚Ä¶.it is worth visiting.
As you would expect, a top-notch ham cutter, they prepare everything you need for home or a big event.
Pir√°mides commuter stop!!!"
ChIJqzTxM84nQg0R0tnyEum8swE,5,"For years Santi and Paco have made us feel at home.
All of great quality and adjusted prices consistent with the quality of what you buy, all accompanied by great professionalism.
Santi's wife, Elena, runs a catering and events company, with its own premises and magnificent high-quality service."
ChIJqzTxM84nQg0R0tnyEum8swE,4,"Good place to buy delicatessen products of all kinds. Variety of sausages, cheeses, p√¢t√©s, preserves. Of course, quality is paid for."
ChIJqzTxM84nQg0R0tnyEum8swE,4,It is a delicatessen with quality products. I go often because I like their products.
ChIJqzTxM84nQg0R0tnyEum8swE,5,Excellent products and great treatment. Totally recommended.
ChIJn_GWHdsnQg0RfBUC5_Stbmc,5,Neighborhood bar/restaurant with good tapas and excellent rice dishes. Pictured is the rice and lobster stew. So delicious!!
ChIJn_GWHdsnQg0RfBUC5_Stbmc,5,"If you are a tourist looking for a real authentic Madrid culinary experience, this would be the place. It's where the locals relax, celebrate and enjoy great food.
Home cooked dishes amd great Tapas. Value for money. Love it. See you soon."
ChIJn_GWHdsnQg0RfBUC5_Stbmc,1,"Never go to a restaurant, if the waiter is appealing you on the street. This was the lesson I had to learn today. I was wandering around for too long and got in this restaurant as I was just too hungry. It is obviously a tourist trap. As the paella took like 20 minutes I decided to have aspargus for a starter. You could think these are fresh in May, but they serve it out of the can. Same for the paella, the ingredients did not seem very fresh and it was just no good food. The waiter was not even asking me how it was, I suppose he knows why. Finally they charged me bread I did not even have. Bad restaurant, really not to recommend"
ChIJn_GWHdsnQg0RfBUC5_Stbmc,4,Attractively decorated  local bar about 5 minutes walk from the madrid rio riverside park. Aperitivos are good and there's an ample terrace on the pavement in front.
ChIJn_GWHdsnQg0RfBUC5_Stbmc,1,"Food is ok. But the service is terrible, senior waiter is very rude once he notices you are a tourist. So many nicer and friendlier places in Madrid, don't go here."
ChIJyWPYLMUnQg0R4zLJ5jkbXzw,4,"Great location close to Madrid Rio and not too far from Puerta de Toledo. Traditional spanish food, nothing fancy, but well done. Their albari√±o wine is very nice, generous portions of food. Don't forget to order their carrot cake. One of the best I've tried recently."
ChIJyWPYLMUnQg0R4zLJ5jkbXzw,5,"Good place for beer and snacks, there are seats outside. Very noiseless, rest after walking."
ChIJyWPYLMUnQg0R4zLJ5jkbXzw,5,"Went with 5 friends, genuinely our favourite bar or restaurant that we went out to, during our stay in Madrid. Friendly staff, great food, placed in a lovely, calm and pleasant park. Though English may not be their strength, they make up for it in friendliness. A treasure in the less touristic parts of Madrid, this restaurant/bar offers you a genuine exposure to the comforts that true Spanish dining can offer. A few free tapas per round of drinks won us over hahah awesome place"
ChIJyWPYLMUnQg0R4zLJ5jkbXzw,4,"A good shaded terrace that is set well apart from traffic
.and some reasonable free tapas with drinks..
Make this a good stopping off point for those visiting the nearby Madrid Rio park"
ChIJyWPYLMUnQg0R4zLJ5jkbXzw,4,Good local food with a great location if you have kids since they can be in the playground beside while you enjoy yourself
ChIJZXJS0tonQg0RuAZyCP3Imik,5,"If you have a motorcycle this is your spot, if not, get a motorcycle and come. Great place, recommended."
ChIJZXJS0tonQg0RuAZyCP3Imik,5,"greetings to the lady who served me like a quick beer, but very friendly service üòä"
ChIJZXJS0tonQg0RuAZyCP3Imik,3,"Waiter and decoration were great! Really nice and original. Although expensive place for the quality of the food. Don't expect that much in that sense. Beers also expensive (around 4-5 euros), maybe because its a music bar with life music, but keeps the prices even if we went a random day, with no music and barely other people around"
ChIJZXJS0tonQg0RuAZyCP3Imik,5,"I love this place! Everything is so american, with a very particular atmosphere. The waiters even help you pick the best beer depending on your taste. I absolutely love it, totally recommended!!!"
ChIJZXJS0tonQg0RuAZyCP3Imik,5,Nice little beer the day after watching Spurs lose the Champions League final in Madrid... Good bar though
ChIJtUnTFkEnQg0RzjfdpB_JV-Q,5,"We went to eat on Sunday with a menu for ‚Ç¨17, cheap for the area. The waitress's attention was very good even though we suffered an incident with a customer who kept complaining all the time. The food is exquisite and the desserts even better."
ChIJtUnTFkEnQg0RzjfdpB_JV-Q,5,"We have been several times and we are delighted to have found a restaurant like this in the area. Very good attention from the waitresses, well-prepared and very delicious dishes, careful presentation and very agile serving.
Congratulations to the cook!
They also have two daily menus, ‚Ç¨9 and ‚Ç¨11.5."
ChIJtUnTFkEnQg0RzjfdpB_JV-Q,3,"Quiet atmosphere, with very good background music, the waiter very friendly, the food a little disappointing, needs improvement. The cod with boiled pil-pil and oil with garlic on top, there is a Paraguayan menu, the homemade gnocchi, the sauce is a little acidic, the koygua steak is very delicious üëç"
ChIJtUnTFkEnQg0RzjfdpB_JV-Q,3,"Good treatment and affordable price.
It was Sunday and it was full and I think it had an impact on the service times, which were too long. The entrec√¥te was very well done and so was the fish, although it was also our fault for not asking for rare. The place is a little cold"
ChIJtUnTFkEnQg0RzjfdpB_JV-Q,4,Good place to eat. Saturday menu ‚Ç¨17 and you stay full. Well located and very friendly treatment. Food from Asturias and Paraguay. Advisable
ChIJVfRk7MMnQg0RBo8ahj57cS4,1,"It is no longer called the canoe. He has little or nothing of Asturian. I ordered a Neapolitan Milanese and they gave me a breaded fillet, which had nothing to do with Neapolitan and when I asked if it didn't have to have tomato and cheese on top, the only answer I got was a simple NO."
ChIJVfRk7MMnQg0RBo8ahj57cS4,2,"Neighborhood bar with a lot of attention that has Asturian and Paraguayan food. What a good fusion! Daily menu and delicious cooked croquettes. To have something if you are passing through and little else.  But these bars have their charm.  There are people from here, from the neighborhood, and you can hear their entire life if you come on a Sunday to have vermouth."
ChIJVfRk7MMnQg0RBo8ahj57cS4,3,"Asturian he has nothing more than appearances. The fabada is very average and the cachopo looks more like a beef steak. They should either improve the recipes or change their style. I don't doubt that they can get it because the service is very good, the prices too, and the gazpacho was delicious."
ChIJVfRk7MMnQg0RBo8ahj57cS4,3,Everything very good. The service was good and the food was delicious. Not out of the ordinary.  The price was good.
ChIJVfRk7MMnQg0RBo8ahj57cS4,5,It is difficult to get a good salmorejo in the area and here I got it! Good portions Menus on weekends! Price _quality_ excellent treatment! Small but very cute place.
ChIJcXc5dcQnQg0RMKAWl9tXm70,5,"How delicious everything is!
And very well priced.
Good cuisine, abundant dishes, varied menu, attentive service...
A simple but highly recommended place to eat at home."
ChIJcXc5dcQnQg0RMKAWl9tXm70,5,During the week you eat great for 13 euros and it is homemade food.
ChIJcXc5dcQnQg0RMKAWl9tXm70,5,"I love this tavern. The food is very good, it is homemade. They have a menu for 13 euros during the week. It's ideal."
ChIJcXc5dcQnQg0RMKAWl9tXm70,5,"The girl, who I imagine is Manola, is very kind and willing, she lets you choose an appetizer, homemade and delicious food. Service and recommendedüíØ%"
ChIJcXc5dcQnQg0RMKAWl9tXm70,5,"Their menu of the day is wonderful, homemade and well prepared!!! I'm Almu, Miguel's friend."
ChIJMaw2qQ0nQg0RnXRALL5zaBc,5,"A good restaurant with homemade food that is well worth it with fabulous service. They have a daily menu with several options for ‚Ç¨12.

The homemade croquettes are very crispy and juicy on the inside, they make grilled meat with quality products at a good price and the homemade cheesecake is worth it.

They have a bar and also a lounge for lunch or dinner with wonderful attention from the staff."
ChIJMaw2qQ0nQg0RnXRALL5zaBc,5,"We were looking for a place in the neighborhood to watch football and play something and it was a great success.
We ordered portions that we loved and they also have hamburgers that we were looking forward to trying and they looked very good and we will definitely return to order them.
The best thing, especially the very attentive and friendly waiter."
ChIJMaw2qQ0nQg0RnXRALL5zaBc,5,"Good daily menus, good portions and the best burgers, I congratulate you 100% recommend eating and on top of that they have games on TV, good experience we will return for sure"
ChIJMaw2qQ0nQg0RnXRALL5zaBc,5,"Wilson is a crack, he serves you very happily and with a lot of love and education.
Homemade food cooked to order
Very good price
Very spacious place"
ChIJMaw2qQ0nQg0RnXRALL5zaBc,5,"Very good service from the waiter.
Super nice and attentive... and he serves you with a smile, which is difficult nowadays.

There is a menu of the day, with 3 starters and 3 seconds to choose from.  For 12e

What I liked the most was the coffee, delicious."
ChIJNypf8MMnQg0R9c2GciN06aE,5,"Authentic local place, perfect for trying traditional cured meats of Spain. Simple plates but proper quality. Option to buy some of them for home is a big plus."
ChIJNypf8MMnQg0R9c2GciN06aE,5,"I really enjoyed having a Friday evening there. The service is nice,the  owner very welcoming and hospitable. He let us try different kinds of their meats, and came to talk to us. I highly recommend, very nice experience."
ChIJNypf8MMnQg0R9c2GciN06aE,3,Very famous but nothing special
ChIJNypf8MMnQg0R9c2GciN06aE,5,"Everything is absolutely wonderful in this place, the girl who serves is very helpful."
ChIJNypf8MMnQg0R9c2GciN06aE,5,"A bar with such good food that it has its own delicatessen. The waiter is pleasant and treats you very well, even taking some details. Their summer red wines are very delicious. Special mention must be made of the coffee liquor that is kept in the refrigerator, of exceptional quality. Good loin, ham and wow the sobrasada! I think this is the first time I have had sobrasada and I like it. Super tasty! A good place for sure."
ChIJqZPDLIYnQg0RvytPrrpbI2k,5,Absolutely amazing!!! Came in for a pisto  sour and stayed for a full meal!! You will be hard pressed to find better Peruvian ceviche. The chef is spot on !!
ChIJqZPDLIYnQg0RvytPrrpbI2k,5,"My first Peruvian food was a great experience.  The friendly server recommended suitable food in fluent English and we enjoyed a pleasant meal with cold draft beer.  In particular, the ceviche sauce was refreshing, and the quality of the fried fish was excellent.  highly recommended"
ChIJqZPDLIYnQg0RvytPrrpbI2k,5,A casual dining hidden gem in the heart of puerto del sol. Definitely worth it.  Don‚Äôt forget to order the chicha morada!! The best üëåüëè
ChIJqZPDLIYnQg0RvytPrrpbI2k,5,One of the best ceviches I had in my life! Great local place to to visit. Highly recommend!
ChIJqZPDLIYnQg0RvytPrrpbI2k,5,"The food was so delicious, good quantity and the price also was so good."
ChIJh58sG8QnQg0RuMdh9fV4b_4,5,Excellent Peruvian Seasoning
ChIJ_XOsfNAnQg0RPwSyslkxnYs,5,"We ended up at this place cause everything else was closed but it didn‚Äôt disappoint! The portions were huge and the service was good. We especially enjoyed the fried fish and the beef dish. The sauce that came with the yuca was really good, it was crema de aj√≠ if I‚Äôm not mistaken."
ChIJ_XOsfNAnQg0RPwSyslkxnYs,5,"Tasty food. Huge portions. Meat, fish. We recommend)"
ChIJ_XOsfNAnQg0RPwSyslkxnYs,1,Bad experience

ChIJa-i_LEAnQg0RVrXzKxsffxQ,5,"Wonderful evening meal at the El Sueno de Carmen. Attentive staff, delicious and imaginative dishes. Authentic and genuine quality of the food. Definitely worth getting out of the touristy Madrid to check it out. I'd gladly come back."
ChIJa-i_LEAnQg0RVrXzKxsffxQ,5,"Best food I have ever had. Made with so much love! Just amazing. I would surely like to come back again.

ChIJa-i_LEAnQg0RVrXzKxsffxQ,5,Outstanding food! Beautifully presented and worth venturing out of the city centre for. Really interesting combinations and a well priced wine list.
ChIJa-i_LEAnQg0RVrXzKxsffxQ,5,"An incredible meal, with even better service! Maycol was an incredible host, provided recommendations, and was just great to chat to in general! Thank God we decided to explore our local! A repetir sin duda!"
ChIJa-i_LEAnQg0RVrXzKxsffxQ,5,"Maycol gave exceptional service!! I'd highly recommend this restaurant. It was quick and efficient! The food was fresh, quick and amazing. Extremely delicious! I'd highly recommend the truffle croquettes and cheesecake ü§åüèª"
ChIJHWK8LqQnQg0REGsDOO4BGZ8,5,"Most amazing service and really nice atmosphere, food was really good too!! Would definitely recommend!!"
ChIJHWK8LqQnQg0REGsDOO4BGZ8,5,"Great food, great service and great drinks!"
ChIJHWK8LqQnQg0REGsDOO4BGZ8,1,"Unprofessional, the service is not top notch, nor will we return due to the poor service.

It seems that they only serve you normally if you order alcohol, we ordered a couple of soft drinks since we came from a trip, and they didn't give us a cover, however, they did put a cover on those next door for ordering a tinto de Verano... You see what a difference...

On top of that, when it came time to pay, they gave us the excuse that it had to be inside with a card, that there was no coverage outside... I don't know, Rick... Maybe inside they had 5G antennas everywhere and that's how their brains were fried and on the terrace were the lakes of Covadonga so there was no coverage...

I had to calm down my cousin Laly from the town who wanted to throw an ice cube at their heads, I almost called my ace in the hole, Don Julio del Rait√°n de Oviedo, to come and show them some of his magical pus to sweeten the atmosphere, but I also had the option of the lethal duo of the cuevona and the orchard, if I warn them they will burst them with their deadly tomatoes from the Laly field.

In short, a great place due to the manners and treatment of the waiters."
ChIJHWK8LqQnQg0REGsDOO4BGZ8,1,"Absolutely disorganized service, some fries as a cover, vermouth in a plastic cup (I don't care if it's the holidays) and all this for ‚Ç¨6.60 for 2 vermouths. It really seems like a scam to me."
ChIJHWK8LqQnQg0REGsDOO4BGZ8,5,"You cannot give more with less. Variety of beers. I can only comment on the potatoes with their delicious sauces....the brava raises the temperature!!!!Small....very small!!!!neighborhood bar that does not prevent providing good service to a pleasant urban terrace hidden from the hustle and bustle of Marqu√©s de Vadillo. Quiet, with ""good"" Eighties music, and natural and sincere attention. Excited about their project, something to be grateful for in these difficult times and careful in their treatment. Great, recovering the joy of doing your job well, whatever it may be. Good luck, he pointed it out to me as a place to return to"
ChIJf31ZMconQg0RVgvfpPX8mYc,3,"We were here for just chilling a Chinese restaurant near Marquis de Vadilo near Rio park. It was a nice treat and okay and cheap food. Not something out of the world or very tasty but also not a too bad experience , one try you can give if you don't want to walk more or looking for some Chinese restaurant with less crowed then can go else better to choose some good options near the by."
ChIJf31ZMconQg0RVgvfpPX8mYc,1,"I ordered an individual menu, when I was eating the spring roll, I felt something hard that turned out to be a nail. Please, never eat here!"
ChIJf31ZMconQg0RVgvfpPX8mYc,5,Perfect

ChIJ2doSqsYnQg0RDGOIdFFiO94,5,"The Peruvian breakfast sandwich was out of this world! Great flavours starting with a crispy bread, pulled soft meat and wonderful marinated onions. Yumm yumm yumm!!"
ChIJ2doSqsYnQg0RDGOIdFFiO94,5,"Best Chicken I've had in Madrid.
Highly recommended!
Friendly staff, large portions and overall fantastic meal.‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJ2doSqsYnQg0RDGOIdFFiO94,5,Very good. Great advise on the food and very tasty.
ChIJ2doSqsYnQg0RDGOIdFFiO94,4,"Men√∫ del dia 12e, no incluye postre pero si cafe o t√©, sirven pan, que en un peruano es raro.
El ceviche bien, y el segundo era un lomo saltado enrollado, curioso, demasiadas patatas creo.
El local y el servicio normal"
ChIJ2doSqsYnQg0RDGOIdFFiO94,5,"Incredible. I chose the Chola burger. The chicken is the most tender I have ever eaten. The atmosphere is very cozy. It's great that restaurants like this are coming to the neighborhood, that they innovate. And for the price, a 10."
ChIJbcXlNDEnQg0ROKE0As6OT-A,1,"I had so much expectations about this place. Unfortunately I left the place very frustrated. There were many options for lunch from 17$ to 25$ and knowing what I know now, I should have chosen one of them. Even if they were not so good, I would not feel so bad .. anyways, I asked the waitress what would be better, and she told me the experience would be great with one of those ""chulet√≥n"". I believed her and after that, she only came back with the meat prepared.. what a bummer. The meat was so tough and chewy that was difficult to eat its pieces... It looked good, but looks are deceiving. In the end,  I got stuck with a bad 104 euros steak.. I am never going back there if they believe they did right on me with this tourist trick."
ChIJbcXlNDEnQg0ROKE0As6OT-A,5,"I loved, loved this restaurant. The steaks 10/10, perfectly cooked, seasoned to perfection. We had an amazing waitress who explained each dish we were unsure of, such a lovely family atmosphere. Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough. And for you get ..it‚Äôs a bargain ."
ChIJbcXlNDEnQg0ROKE0As6OT-A,5,"This BBQ restaurant offers ample dining space indoors, making it ideal for hosting large gatherings. The staff is welcoming and proficient in both English and Spanish. The restaurant specializes in fixed-price menus comprising starters, mains, and desserts, priced at ‚Ç¨20, ‚Ç¨25, and ‚Ç¨30 respectively, inclusive of beverages.

Opting for the 25 EUR set menu, I selected mollejas a la brasa, pica√±a, and strawberry ice cream for dessert. While the portion size and pricing were satisfactory, I found the pica√±a to be somewhat dry and tough, lacking the succulence and tenderness found at other establishments.

Located a bit outside the city center of Madrid, this restaurant is a convenient option for drivers, offering affordability without compromising on quality. It's definitely worth considering for a visit."
ChIJbcXlNDEnQg0ROKE0As6OT-A,3,"I came here to eat twice, the first time I ordered an entrecot and it was great. The second time however, I came during the day and ordered their menu del d√≠a with entrecot as the second dish, I was so disappointed. The meat was full of tendons and tissues, and over cooked (I ordered Al punto and the inside was almost white). My teeth had suffered eating the steak, and I regret not having returned it. I don‚Äôt recommend their menu del d√≠a if this is the quality of meat you‚Äôll get, I don‚Äôt mind receiving a smaller portion for menu del d√≠a but such a low quality meat should never be served to customers"
ChIJbcXlNDEnQg0ROKE0As6OT-A,5,"The Best Restaurant Ever !!! In Madrid , I highly recommend this place! The Barbecue Chicken was Delicious!
excellent Service, The Chef Came to the Table and Check is everything is Ok with our Food !"
ChIJkYJhhy8nQg0Rg7PsosNKWWo,5,"I absolutely love this place! It‚Äôs conveniently located just a stone‚Äôs throw away from the subway station, making it a perfect spot for a quick meal. The food is consistently fresh, and what‚Äôs even better is that it‚Äôs cooked in just minutes, so you‚Äôre never left waiting long.

The staff here are always kind and attentive, ensuring that every order is checked thoroughly before you collect it, so nothing is ever missing. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting, perfect for unwinding after a long day or enjoying a casual meal. Plus, the added perk of a self-serve drink machine that allows you to refill your drinks free of charge is just the cherry on top!

Whether you‚Äôre stopping by for lunch or dinner, this place never disappoints. Highly recommended!

ChIJsZECQ9InQg0R0w_qAHxedXQ,5,"We enjoyed having dinner at this restaurant. Not only because the cosy and welcoming atmosphere but also because the staff was friendly and accommodating. Additionally, the food was freshly prepared and served hot, which made the experience even more enjoyable. The restaurant also had a good selection of wines . In my opinion, it was a wonderful experience, and I look forward to visiting this restaurant again and again."
ChIJsZECQ9InQg0R0w_qAHxedXQ,5,"I dined alone while in Spain, the hospitality from staff here was impeccable. Food a unique culinary experience. If considering dining here, the answer is 100% YES!"
ChIJsZECQ9InQg0R0w_qAHxedXQ,2,A restaurant with Michelin star is impossible to keep personal with zero english knowledge. It took us 20 minutes to order using google translate and the only man who understood us a litlle. Then we waited almost one hour for a paella with prawns wich was good but the wait and problems ordering were just too much to have a decent experience. Then the price in the menu was 26‚Ç¨ (two people) on the bill it was 2x26‚Ç¨ with no explanation.
ChIJsZECQ9InQg0R0w_qAHxedXQ,5,"Our group of six had a wonderful experience at Atrapallada! Good customer service is hard to find, but here you can find it. Very professional service in all staff members, but we especially loved our server, Manuel, who gave us great recommendations and just overall enhanced the experience. The food was excellent, great flavors and just an overall great dining experience (and for a great price value!). Would absolutely recommend!"
ChIJsZECQ9InQg0R0w_qAHxedXQ,5,Went there for a team dinner and had an amazing dinner . I had the burrata salad with artichoke ice cream. It was very fresh and tasty. The desserts were all very good.
ChIJoQ45FM0nQg0R8uZGbNxFxoY,1,"This place has gone to the Rubbish hole! Nothing like it was before. Noisy, dirty, and service.. well it's self service. Stafg behind the counter takes longer. Charges an additional 0.15 cents for Ketuchup.. !!"
ChIJoQ45FM0nQg0R8uZGbNxFxoY,5,"Sir I want to talk to you, I live in India and am ready to work permanently in your pizza store for, I have worked in the pizza store for 3 years. Please sir reply me"
ChIJoQ45FM0nQg0R8uZGbNxFxoY,5,Staff is super friendly and very proactive about taking care of anything you need. Never experienced service like that at a Burger King.
ChIJoQ45FM0nQg0R8uZGbNxFxoY,2,A woman working there named Carmen I think was really impolite and unprofessional. When someone is a client that pays and speaks to you nicely you can definitely be more patient and polite especially when you see that they don‚Äôt speak your language very well.
ChIJoQ45FM0nQg0R8uZGbNxFxoY,5,This place remind me of home. I come from USA and going to Burger King was a good thing. I like it the food was great. Everything was well cooked. I really enjoyed the service as well. The man was very helpful. I went with a friend and we were well treated and our food was well cooked as well. The place was clean and I totally recommend it.
ChIJvxf0OS0mQg0Rm31LrFdUr2o,5,"I started going recently and I wish I had gone sooner, quality meat and above all very good treatment from the employees, Boubker took care of me and gave me very good recommendations and exquisite treatment. It is going to become my trusted butcher shop!!!
I especially recommend the meatloaf and the four cheese burgers."
ChIJvxf0OS0mQg0Rm31LrFdUr2o,4,"The quality of the entire offer is very good, in relation to the staff, friendliness and especially in the butcher shop where the person guides you kindly and is a person who has been in Gamo for a long time but always the same."
ChIJvxf0OS0mQg0Rm31LrFdUr2o,1,"I find it embarrassing that they charge me quite high prices and I get home, weigh it, realizing that even with the packaging it doesn't reach the weight I paid for. It is a denounceable practice and I feel deceived. Be very aware of it."
ChIJvxf0OS0mQg0Rm31LrFdUr2o,1,Why is it that every time you ask for a precise amount they give you more? 100 grams of cheese become 166 grams to the ears of the dispatcher. It should still be said in ounces
ChIJvxf0OS0mQg0Rm31LrFdUr2o,1,"One of the emblematic establishments of Embajadores has lost a lot in its service. Starting with the delicatessen, since Miguel left the service has been disastrous.
The prices of all their products, which are good, have been raised embarrassingly."
ChIJE0enSdInQg0R-cHhZ2hWlCg,4,"First of all, I must say that the restaurant and the waiters were very polite and nice.But my order came wrong. I ordered a chicken sandwich, but they brought a meat sandwich. Since it was the first day of the new year, I didn't want to bother people. The sandwich that came was delicious, but I still wanted to eat the sandwich I ordered. Still, everything was worth the money, thank you"
ChIJE0enSdInQg0R-cHhZ2hWlCg,5,Yoli was extremely helpful as we did not speak Spanish.  Breakfast was amazing and coffee included!  Should have been coming here every day for breakfast so many options!
ChIJE0enSdInQg0R-cHhZ2hWlCg,5,"I would highly recommend this branch, all the employees were super nice, special shoutout to Aroa for answering my stupid questions and serving us with a smile on her face! Thank you! üòä"
ChIJE0enSdInQg0R-cHhZ2hWlCg,5,The Food was very good! And the Service is also very nice Lucia is a funny waitress we will come again :)
ChIJE0enSdInQg0R-cHhZ2hWlCg,5,"Very good food. Look for ""Menu del d√≠a"" for a fair price."
ChIJb5_UcM0nQg0RUEFnNRw2FbI,2,"Used to be a good bar, however on a recent visit it was easy to see that it has lost it¬¥s charm. Low quality beer served by a disinterested barman is not my idea of a good Madrid bar. Never mind that we were charged ‚Ç¨3.70 for each doble!! Cannot understand the recent 5 star reviews. Stay clear of it, I reckon."
ChIJb5_UcM0nQg0RUEFnNRw2FbI,5,"The best bar in Madrid! Super authentic and the service is amazing!! They have pinball, foosball, great appetizers and cold beer! The staff are super nice!!"
ChIJb5_UcM0nQg0RUEFnNRw2FbI,5,Awesome local madrileno bar.
ChIJb5_UcM0nQg0RUEFnNRw2FbI,5,"This is one of the legendary ""old man"" bars of Madrid. We stopped for una ca√±a (short beer), and enjoyed ourselves a lot."
ChIJb5_UcM0nQg0RUEFnNRw2FbI,5,Great spot in Madrid to have authentic delicious tapas and enjoy a friendly atmosphere with a very professional service. Highly recommend
ChIJLZ5LCDMmQg0R-40ED_GcM-0,3,"Smaller Irish bar that can't make up its mind if it wants to be Spanish / English or Irish.

Nothing wrong with this...though.

A pint of Guiness here is at the most 1/2 size.  However a shot of Jameson is nearly 3 shots so it all balances out.  Lol

We did not eat here but the fish and chips looked great.

Location has limited inside seating and a large outside dining area.

No bar seating at this time.

Prices were the best we have come across in a long while."
ChIJLZ5LCDMmQg0R-40ED_GcM-0,5,One of my favorite Irish pubs.  There's always football on and the Guinness is poured better than most other places. Cheers!
ChIJLZ5LCDMmQg0R-40ED_GcM-0,4,"This place is ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. You have well and quickly served Guinness, fairly authentic Irish interior, two screens to watch a game.  Waiters are friendly enough and professional. Kitchen works fast and the food is fine. Just fine, though. This is an average place. But average doesn‚Äôt fail. And it‚Äôs valuable. I appreciate Taberna Morrighan and will enjoy another Guinness here soon again."
ChIJLZ5LCDMmQg0R-40ED_GcM-0,2,"We came on 16th March (Sat) just before St Patrick‚Äôs as I thought there would be celebrations. I know this place for years and have come here for St Patrick‚Äôs when it‚Äôs been on random week days. The surprise was not nice, reggaeton music on does not make any sense. Neither does it create the atmosphere it has to. The usual gift hats were being given around with Guinness pints but it really did not feel anything like Irish or St Patrick‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a shame as there are some good beers and the place is nice. I doubt we‚Äôll come back next year on this day"
ChIJLZ5LCDMmQg0R-40ED_GcM-0,4,Best place to watch a Real Madrid match in Arguanzela
ChIJs7XREzMmQg0RU4kODXuvlpE,1,"DONT COME HERE!! Oh my gosh I can't believe this place!! The owner didn't speak good Spanish and didn't understand what I wanted.
I don't eat meat and I've ordered a meal with bambus, pimientos and mushrooms. I double checked with her if that's what I'm getting and in the end I get a meal with all of the meats there possible is, beef, chicken and prawns. PLUS i have waited 30 mins for my food! This is an absolute joke!!
Actually the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been to."
ChIJs7XREzMmQg0RU4kODXuvlpE,1,Literally the worst Chinese food I‚Äôve ever had. Also gave me food poisoning. Do not come here!!
ChIJs7XREzMmQg0RU4kODXuvlpE,5,"I‚Äôve tried their soup, rice and shrimp dish and it was really good. Reminds me of home cook food. Cheap and quick. Will be my regular"
ChIJs7XREzMmQg0RU4kODXuvlpE,5,"Gentle,quick and quiet. Is like a chinese restaurant with a 50‚Äô edge, Good price as well , the food was tasty ,the Veg crunchy and you can see the almonds in the dish something i like."
ChIJs7XREzMmQg0RU4kODXuvlpE,1,Terrible
ChIJXd_HjS0mQg0RHvIKFLGE1pU,5,"The food was delicious, the services was great and I fully recommend this place. It‚Äôs worth of visiting this place because there was the best food I have been eating during my stay in Madrid‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJXd_HjS0mQg0RHvIKFLGE1pU,5,"Incredibly good Middle Eastern spread. The starters of hummus, falafels and tatzeki were perfect. The mixed meat platter and chicken skewers were excellently done. The ambience was so Arabian. Great evening with family."
ChIJXd_HjS0mQg0RHvIKFLGE1pU,5,"If you‚Äôre looking for an authentic and special dining experience, this Lebanese restaurant in Madrid is a true gem. From the moment you step in, the warm decor and traditional music set the perfect atmosphere for a memorable evening.

The service is impeccable‚Äîattentive, fast, and always with a smile. And the food? Simply outstanding. The creamy dips (hummus, baba ganoush, and mutabal) were incredibly smooth and flavorful, perfect to start the meal. The lamb was juicy, perfectly seasoned, and cooked to perfection, showcasing the chef‚Äôs attention to detail.

As if that weren‚Äôt enough, on Fridays and Saturdays at 10 PM, a belly dancer adds a magical touch to the night, making the experience even cooler"
ChIJXd_HjS0mQg0RHvIKFLGE1pU,1,"One of the worst experiences of life while food was  being served out after 2 hours while the final delivery time was 35-40 mins

I went there on Saturday night the restaurant was full packed and in the whole restaurant they don't have even one person who can speak properly with customers.

While placing the order was really difficult.

And we have to give them multiple reminders for getting the food delivered.

The Whole menu was delivered with too many pauses and delays."
ChIJXd_HjS0mQg0RHvIKFLGE1pU,5,"i had a great time at this place.
i literally just came across it by random searching on google maps of what restaurants are close to Atocha and i found this place interesting!
what makes it so unique from other restaurants is that they have a live performance! not once, but twice did the dancer wowed us all and made us stop having dinner for a while. i applaud the waiters and the service they gave us. the dancer was spectacular and the food was great and served well.
i enjoyed the dining and the experience and it was truly something that made me more curious about trying different food from different cultures.
this restaurant is well-decorated too!

at the end of our meal, we're given complimentary shots too! that was super nice. will definitely tell my friends to see this place for themselves and I'll keep coming back as well."
ChIJgX6MHS0mQg0RzsTmgNzmcfA,4,"Nachos had huge chunks of meat, and our small burgers still had very thick patties. Ended up paying about ‚Ç¨20/person so it's pretty overpriced."
ChIJgX6MHS0mQg0RzsTmgNzmcfA,2,"Honestly I couldn‚Äôt recommend this place. Price-wise it is reasonable if you take into account the huge portion sizes; although personally I dislike having to eat that much. Service was quite poor, but mainly I found the food to be extremely bad quality. Very little variety in the menu, virtually everything seems to be coated in cheese/oil. Chips were undercooked and tasteless, chicken dry and unseasoned. Possibly fine if you enjoy these kinds of food but personally I found it extremely bland and slightly disgusting."
ChIJgX6MHS0mQg0RzsTmgNzmcfA,5,"The burger, chicken sandwich, and salad were all very good.  Loved the French fries too.  Really appreciate the server who let us in close to closing time and helped us get our meal."
ChIJgX6MHS0mQg0RzsTmgNzmcfA,1,"The TREX ribs is as cold as ice. The XXL Beer ribs is as chewy as bubblegum. The service is very poor, we waited long for our order and then they served us that kind of food. I tried to approach the waitress a lot of time but all of them are just talking and not even paying attention. We wanted to ask if they can at least heat the TREX because it is really cold but nothing happened. They were just talking and laughing and all. Even giving the plates for sharing in the starters they just put it on the edge of the table without telling us, they just put it there and that‚Äôs it. Almost all of them are not approachable. That is really disappointing. The food is pricey but the service and food is very poor."
ChIJgX6MHS0mQg0RzsTmgNzmcfA,5,Super great place to come ! They are super nice and the food we had was spectacular. 10/10. We recommend the smoked wings !!
ChIJVTy25c0nQg0RnN2VMI3RcqI,4,"they make good pizza!! we go there every month and sometimes order through Glovo. either delivery or take out - the service is pretty quick. the only downside of the place is they say our favorite kind of pizza is unavailable for special offers, even though it is listed

in overall, it's a good spot to eat. it's clean and the people working there are nice"
ChIJVTy25c0nQg0RnN2VMI3RcqI,1,"Very limited menu, the cheapest pizza on a campaign day is 6‚Ç¨, and the others almost 15‚Ç¨, cheese sticks don‚Äôt even have cheese - just a garlic sauce on top of pizza bread.. The pizza was normal, but don‚Äôt match the price/quality balance. Wouldn‚Äôt go back."
ChIJVTy25c0nQg0RnN2VMI3RcqI,1,"Found a short thick hair baked into my pizza. I found it sticking out of the cheese base when I removed a topping. I‚Äôd rather not speculate as to where on the body this hair may have originated from. Absolutely revolting. Have been ordering from here for 2 years and never had a problem, now I will never eat here again."
ChIJVTy25c0nQg0RnN2VMI3RcqI,3,The pizza was delicious! The service was terrible! It took over 20 minutes before we could order. The employees acted like we were not there. Very frustrating to not even be acknowledged! The pizza was full of cheese and the ingredients seemed to be plentiful.
ChIJVTy25c0nQg0RnN2VMI3RcqI,1,"Even for Papa John's this was worse than normal quality. The employees seemed lost in space and like they couldn't care less about helping anyone. I got dragged to this place by a Canadian friend who insisted on ""having a taste of home"" while on holiday in Spain, and to top it off the pizza was incredibly low quality. Hope the place closes and another tapas bar takes it's place."
ChIJeT3UkcwnQg0RWd7g3vx7bUc,5,A family restaurant that serves a delicious pulpo a la gallega. We had it for starters followed with entrecot troceado al punto. Quick service and huge servings! I‚Äôm not sure if the flan that we had for dessert was homemade but it was as great as the rest. Highly recommended.
ChIJeT3UkcwnQg0RWd7g3vx7bUc,5,"Incredible, unbeatable seafood. But come with a reservation!"
ChIJeT3UkcwnQg0RWd7g3vx7bUc,3,Not amazing but kind of okayish. The octopus was very pricy compared to what we got for it. For this location we were expecting a bit more moderate pricing.
ChIJeT3UkcwnQg0RWd7g3vx7bUc,5,"Delicious! The octopus was beautiful, but the chuletas (chuletitas) blew my mind. Amazing!"
ChIJeT3UkcwnQg0RWd7g3vx7bUc,5,"Great food, great service, ok prices"
ChIJ8XRoF80nQg0RMnk3I0_ew2Y,5,"This is a wonderful place to experience the art of Flamenco song and dance in an intimate setting. The staff was friendly and kind, and the food and drink service was fast and efficient. The dancers, the singer and the guitarist were mesmerizing, and they looked happy to be on stage, sharing their art and athleticism with the crowd. They brought passion, joy and intensity to their performance. It was my first time attending a Flamenco performance and I'm so glad we went with this intimate and personal setting, instead of with one of the larger, not commercialized performances in central Madrid. My thanks to the performers and staff of Caf√© Ziryab for a wonderful evening!"
ChIJ8XRoF80nQg0RMnk3I0_ew2Y,5,"We had the most incredible experience at Cafe Ziryab experiencing their flamenco show. We have three daughters who have been heavily involved in dance and theater for twenty years, and I have never seen such passion on a stage as we did during this show. It was incredible! The setting was intimate, the food was delicious, the music and dancing were just phenomenal. 10/10 recommend!"
ChIJ8XRoF80nQg0RMnk3I0_ew2Y,5,This what Flamenco is suppose to be. I felt grabbed from the moments the lights dimmed and the first string was strummed on the guitar. The dancing was phenomenal as was the music. Make your next night out in a place that is not rushing you in to rush you out for the next performance. To much of Flamenco is about getting as much money out of each show and this is not that kind of show. The artists loved what they where doing and the free drink with the show was not a bad addition. Thank you again for such a great night out. I only wish it could have been longer. Though I do not know where the performers would have gotten the energy. That was an explosion of energy from start to finish.
ChIJ8XRoF80nQg0RMnk3I0_ew2Y,5,"What a gem of a place! We had an unforgettable experience at this cozy little caf√©. The atmosphere was warm and homely, and the staff made us feel right at home. Our Italian waitress Irene was incredibly friendly and spoke excellent Spanish and English, which added a nice personal touch. The highlight of the evening was the amazing flamenco performance‚Äîit was absolutely mesmerizing! The dancers and artists were so talented, and they created such a lively, welcoming vibe. Everyone was friendly, and it really felt like we were part of something special. If you‚Äôre looking for a place with great food, incredible entertainment, and a genuine, cozy feel, this is it!"
ChIJ8XRoF80nQg0RMnk3I0_ew2Y,5,"Fantastic flamenco show. Fantastic coffee. Good view. Good seat and table
Reallllly excellent service. As the payment had not yet gone through, but they let me watch anyway, it went through whilst I was there. My phone desperately needed charging for me to find my way back to the airbnb, so they charged it for me."
ChIJAcxCuDImQg0RLx9jer47YA4,5,"Great place for lunch during the week. ""Men√∫ del d√≠a"" (starter, main dish and dessert) for only ‚Ç¨11. The quality of the food is exceptionally good for the price."
ChIJAcxCuDImQg0RLx9jer47YA4,5,"Good tapas, good place to have some drinks at the terrace. Great prices"
ChIJAcxCuDImQg0RLx9jer47YA4,5,Lovely place and great food!
ChIJAcxCuDImQg0RLx9jer47YA4,5,Loved the fabada and rabo de toro
ChIJAcxCuDImQg0RLx9jer47YA4,5,"Delicious. Top quality homemade food and large portions. Price according to quality. With a portion of meatballs for 10 euros you eat plenty and the person who served us was very nice.

Super recommended if you want to eat traditional homemade food."
ChIJ_9-Fo9InQg0Rkd8TA0Eqa1s,4,"Lots of craft beers that I had never seen before. If you like beer, a must."
ChIJ_9-Fo9InQg0Rkd8TA0Eqa1s,4,Quiet and familiar

ChIJsdUu9NInQg0RSIOX33nEQIg,5,Didn't have any food here but the beer is cheap and good and crackers with cheese were served alongside. The bartender David was great and was super fun to comun√≠cate through language barrier. Great experience all around
ChIJsdUu9NInQg0RSIOX33nEQIg,4,"Busy on Sunday mornings, so you have to wait for service.  Small tapa with your drink. Nice terrace. Traditional food."
ChIJsdUu9NInQg0RSIOX33nEQIg,4,Good beer and drink selection. When you order a drink you get a tapa. This is a nice spot where locals enjoy a drink or meal in the Empajadores neighborhood.
ChIJsdUu9NInQg0RSIOX33nEQIg,4,"Really tasty and cheap hamburger! 4 stars only for it.  Other staff is below average, don't try to eat it."
ChIJsdUu9NInQg0RSIOX33nEQIg,4,Good tapas served with every drink. Nice place and attentive staff.
ChIJSWZK6dInQg0RUeQG9PpouZM,5,"Ordered a couple of beers for me n my wife and got a DELICIOUS tapa to compliment. We're staying for a few days and will come back for another round! The tapa had garbanzo beans, tripe, pork and spices. Definitely a local bar with regulars."
ChIJSWZK6dInQg0RUeQG9PpouZM,1,"Terrible tapa to go with my house Red wine. Nothing fresh came with my second wine and the they charged me 6,40 for 2 red wines. Total ripoff. I even had to ask if they were charging me the ""foreign looking' price. AVOID."
ChIJSWZK6dInQg0RUeQG9PpouZM,5,Great local place. The chicken is awesome. We loved it üòÄ
ChIJSWZK6dInQg0RUeQG9PpouZM,5,Very good place to have some portions and sandwiches. Good atmosphere. And good prices
ChIJSWZK6dInQg0RUeQG9PpouZM,5,"Wednesday menu, cooked very good. The soup with thick noodles, removing that detail, is equal to or better than one for 22 euros without a drink and without cutlery included. The place is very modest, to put it mildly, but also very cheap at 11.90 all inclusive."
ChIJSc6jbTMmQg0R8-jcLlKvAoE,5,"As a Frenchman, thank you very much for this superb performance of delicious meats üëçüèª"
ChIJSc6jbTMmQg0R8-jcLlKvAoE,5,
ChIJm_gQ0NMnQg0RTVuLJEzT6-c,5,Bar was friendly and had great tapas! My wife and I ordered vermouth and received pallea as our first tapa and chicken wings for our second tapa. The vermouth was so good I had to order another one! This is a great local spot if you're trying to experience an authentic Spanish experience.
ChIJm_gQ0NMnQg0RTVuLJEzT6-c,5,A small local bar close to El Rastro flea market. Food/Drinks were all pretty good. We enjoyed a lot :)
ChIJm_gQ0NMnQg0RTVuLJEzT6-c,5,"My favorite place in Madrid!
The staff is super friendly and always in a good mood, the quality of food & drinks is great.
Go there on a Sunday during El Rastro to take in the full flea market madness while sipping a coffee :)"
ChIJm_gQ0NMnQg0RTVuLJEzT6-c,5,"Lovely bar, I really liked the coffee and the churros are wonderful! The staff is kind and helpful!"
ChIJm_gQ0NMnQg0RTVuLJEzT6-c,4,"Excellent breakfast. Very good molletes.
Friendly service.
Clean and very good prices."
ChIJz8PqxDMmQg0R8oquyZN_kj4,4,Typical Spanish tapas bar. The portions are quite large so be mindful when ordering. They‚Äôre not the most refined or high quality tapas but they do the job and it‚Äôs good value for money.
ChIJz8PqxDMmQg0R8oquyZN_kj4,5,"I can tell you‚Ä¶ one of my favorites spots in Spain. The tapas and the beer were excellent. The huevos rotos, the small tapas with drinks‚Ä¶.this place is a neighborhood star in the Embajadores. Good services‚Ä¶ just like home!"
ChIJz8PqxDMmQg0R8oquyZN_kj4,4,"Always busy, but for a good reason. They follow the tradition of Granada bars to offer big and tasty tapas for free with your drink.
They have a big selection of tapas to choose from when you order your drink
Service is fast and effective
Nice place if you can find a free spot"
ChIJz8PqxDMmQg0R8oquyZN_kj4,5,"Had to wait 10 minutes for a table - good sign. Order a drink and you get a tapas for free from the list.
Bocadillo de calamares cost 5,90 ‚Ç¨ and was the size of an arm.
Cosy atmosphere, friendly service.
Much recommended."
ChIJz8PqxDMmQg0R8oquyZN_kj4,5,This is a great place to have good beer and free tapas. It‚Äôs far from the center and all the tourists‚Äô traps. The waiters are attentive and the service is smooth. I highly recommend!
ChIJl4O9BlyHZUARVysOGe9PE8o,5,"This is undoubtedly the best experience I had in Europe. The staff is always smiling and welcoming, and despite the language barrier, they really go above and beyond to help.

As a regular customer now, I really feel like a VIP. It is really great to see that some {small} shop still understand how to treat customers.

The quality is great, the service is great, and the price is just right.

Thanks for making daily grocery something to look forward to."
ChIJl4O9BlyHZUARVysOGe9PE8o,5,"Excellent treatment, they advise you if you need it and the products are of the highest quality. As for the cheeses, they have some that they make with very original alcoholic beverages that you don't usually find and that make a difference. They give you a try to decide and recommend you based on your tastes. The two times I have gone I have left very happy. In addition, they make custom boards and other homemade creations."
ChIJl4O9BlyHZUARVysOGe9PE8o,4,"BUTCHER - DELIVERY WITH FOCUS ON EXCELLENCE
It is worth highlighting and highlighting the establishments committed to excellence in their operations and the focus on passion for the customer. Well, the products in its portfolio are available on the market from a wide range of suppliers who supply those who demand them.
What is the difference then? Commitment to the client, selecting those that meet their high level of demand for gastronomic excellence.
Next, it is important how they are presented. And, after the last renovation in which they have separated the butcher shop environment from the delicatessen environment, the result is outstanding. They perfectly comply with one of the basic rules of merchandising, maximizing the aesthetics and elegance of the product and arousing emotion in customers to increase sales.
And in customer service, it is clear that they know that one of the most important pillars of any project is customer service, and that is more than just being attentive to the client. If you exceed their expectations, you will ensure their loyalty.
Congratulations to the owner and professionals and to continue growing by always reviewing good practices!"
ChIJl4O9BlyHZUARVysOGe9PE8o,5,"A few days ago I bought some cheeses and other things to make a personalized box for Valentine's Day for my partner and I loved both the treatment received and the advice from the girl in the cheese area. Quality of the products 10. The site is very clean.
It is worth the quality-price."
ChIJl4O9BlyHZUARVysOGe9PE8o,5,"Excellent Ham, Cheese Factory and great selection of meats.

High quality products and lots of variety.
Especially on these dates, already prepared products ready to cook such as Cachopo de Campo, Cachopo Iberico, Cachopo beef, Cachopo beef ham and cheese, sirloin Wellington...
Very professional and helpful staff.

The ham is delicious and they tell us that they can bone it and vacuum pack it.
A perfect service.
We will return to continue testing their products."
ChIJx5qxci0mQg0RQH84BOajpk4,5,I saw a recommendation for this place online and it completely lived up to my expectations. We took the 3 course meal. It‚Äôs like a Michelin star restaurant without the high prices. Each recipe was very unique. They even have a sommelier . Everything was delicious and beautifully served. The chocolate ganash for desert was incredible.
ChIJx5qxci0mQg0RQH84BOajpk4,5,"Unique and exotic food‚Äîdefinitely not typical. But the balance of flavors and taste is excellent! If you're tired of the same old dishes, this restaurant is worth trying. Every dish we tried, including the desserts, was fantastic!

I also have to give them credit for the presentation of the blue cheesecake and their boldness in serving it, even though it's a love-it-or-hate-it kind of dish. When you take a bite, the blue cheese flavor hits at the end‚Äîit was great for me!""

And the service was impeccable!!"
ChIJx5qxci0mQg0RQH84BOajpk4,2,"Is it good value for money? ‚Ä¶ no, a number of meals recommended by the waiter were expensive, small in size and an average taste.

The waiter service was very peculiar, not being very polite."
ChIJx5qxci0mQg0RQH84BOajpk4,5,"Exquisite tasting menu: 3 starters + 2 main courses + dessert.
Service very kind and attentive.
Wine recommendation was spot on.
I would come back anytime, no hesitation."
ChIJx5qxci0mQg0RQH84BOajpk4,4,"Modern Spanish restaurant with room for improvement. The ham croquettes and cod fingers are spectacular. But the Russian salad tasted flat. The pork blade (our main dish) and the deconstructed lemon pie (our dessert) were pretty good but lacked a bit of refinement. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner at Uskar, but it's not in the same league as Bardero. Great wine menu, though."
ChIJE0enSdInQg0R7EQRT6jjkQc,5,Miriani was such a warm and excellent waitress! We will come back if only to see her again!! The food was excellent too!!üòú
ChIJE0enSdInQg0R7EQRT6jjkQc,4,"Nice restaurant, well located and decorated. The crew is kind and the service was correct, with very low waiting time considering the amount of people. The food tasted great and the portions were appropriated, good relationship quality-price."
ChIJE0enSdInQg0R7EQRT6jjkQc,3,"One of the plates on the table was very dirty, one of the glasses were stinky..the carpaccio was tasteless so we added salt and olive oil to it. The pizzas were good, the ravioli was my favourite"
ChIJE0enSdInQg0R7EQRT6jjkQc,2,"We ate for the first time in this chain, because they had the 2x1 promotion. We thought it would be a nice way to try it. We were very disappointed, the pizza is premade and they just warm it up. The mozzarella cheese was not even melted. It made us feel a bit bad after. Even though it looks really good on paper, we could buy a frozen pizza in the super market and it would taste the same, and would not have the 13‚Ç¨ price tag. We will never come back to pay full price for this. Gave it 2 stars just for the promotion. Overall bad experience, there are many authentic and good pizzas around lavapies which are better."
ChIJE0enSdInQg0R7EQRT6jjkQc,5,"Firstly I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this place, I got the chance to taste some delicious Italian cuisine in Spain.
The staff were amazing plus they gave us lollypops when we left which was very kind of them.
Both the pasta and the pizza we ordered were delicious but the sangria tasted a bit funny.
Great food pared with an amazing place and service equalled to the perfect night out in Madrid"
ChIJ75XxissnQg0RB-nu8GRpclQ,2,"The service was attentive, but the food was very poor. The bread served was bone-dry. The entrec√¥te, ordered medium, was completely raw inside. It came with soggy fries. The sauce was awful."
ChIJ75XxissnQg0RB-nu8GRpclQ,5,Great discovery not too pricy at all! The pulpo was amazing and the cachopo was mind-blowing. Highly recommended!
ChIJ75XxissnQg0RB-nu8GRpclQ,3,Easy food in general.  Not the best but ok. Nice to sit outside and enjoy your beer.
ChIJ75XxissnQg0RB-nu8GRpclQ,1,"We came here on our first day in Madrid, the restaurant was just a few blocks away from the apartment we were staying at. BIG MISTAKE, it was around 5pm and we were told the kitchen was closed, but they were still serving tapas‚Ä¶since we had just landed in Madrid after a 9hrs flight we agreed to have the tapas as there were not many other options around. We were told they could serve croquetas, calamari and some made up salad with crab (it really was fake crab meat, sashimi). The croquetas tasted tart and staled, like they had been forgotten outside the fridge for quite some time, the calamari was gross, over-fried with a hard rubber like texture inside. The only thing that was somewhat edible was the sashimi salad with mayo. The service was ok, the food disgusting. After all the terrible food, they charged 55 euros‚Ä¶only the poor attempt at the calamari was 18 euros!!! We were virtually scammed, never came back!!"
ChIJ75XxissnQg0RB-nu8GRpclQ,2,"The food is ok, the price is somehow normal. but the service is really bad. The waiter doesn't speak even you said thank you every time .after you said I will pay by card  twice the waiter seems understood.
The door of the toilet can't close and the toilet papel finished at 20:50, and the typical Spanish dinner time is between 8:30 and 0:00."
ChIJ9SHLrtMnQg0RaceuVbKqFzQ,5,"What a great place and a great collection of beers. It is local, small and cute but it is a great choice for beer lovers. Very clean, friendly and it gives you a sense of tranquility. Just pass the fence and behind it js!! Highly highly recommend."
ChIJ9SHLrtMnQg0RaceuVbKqFzQ,5,Best artisan beers in madrid. Great atmosphere and even better beers!
ChIJ9SHLrtMnQg0RaceuVbKqFzQ,1,"closed. should be open, but nah. pity. an update would be really appreciated by your potential customers!"
ChIJ9SHLrtMnQg0RaceuVbKqFzQ,5,Friendly service and great drinks!
ChIJ9SHLrtMnQg0RaceuVbKqFzQ,5,THIS IS NOW  A TOTTENHAM PUB ONLY!!
ChIJEwt6N9InQg0ROU-BkRGySTc,5,"Visited with a friend on a Sunday after El Rastro de Madrid. Perfect Asian experience! I had Pollo con verduras, rice and arroz con tres delicias. All of them were good. Reasonable price. A perfect place for Chinese food."
ChIJEwt6N9InQg0ROU-BkRGySTc,5,"This place is amazing - we ordered it on Uber eats and it came fresh and hot. Also really good taste, as expats in Madrid, this is some of the best Chinese food we've had.

The dim sum selection is incredible and the noodles are amazing! I wish they had ho-fun though ( pls add this to the menu).

Definitely ordering from here again!"
ChIJEwt6N9InQg0ROU-BkRGySTc,2,"Ordered via Uber Eats.

TLDR: Poor representation of Asian cuisine (fast food or authentic version). Dry rice, bland food, quick delivery.
Edit: (based on feedback from owner) removed my score for atmosphere since we did not eat here and adjusted the score higher on service since the order was delivered quickly. My initial score was tying service to food quality.

[1] Sopa de Wan-Tun
[1] Pollo Salteado con Verduras
[2] white rice

My wife and I are visiting from New York City (with Cantonese origins) were disappointed at the food. The plain rice and the chicken we ordered was extremely dry and the wonton soup did not resemble the authentic versions that I've had in New York or Guangdong, not even the Chinese fast food versions. I understand that food may cater to the local palette but the food we ordered was disappointing."
ChIJEwt6N9InQg0ROU-BkRGySTc,1,"Ordered from Ubereat.
1. Noodle is super oily and tasteless. 1shrimp, 2pc of beef slices and 2pc of thinly slice mushroom.
2. Sour sweet chicken - alot of chicken meat, but taste dry and not juicy. Below expectation.
3. They gave free one packet of cracker = OK.
Overall: below average taste and not authentic chinese food.
If you are looking for bland taste non-asian type Chinese food, then this is the one."
ChIJEwt6N9InQg0ROU-BkRGySTc,5,"Extremely delicious and mouthwatering food, nice service and affordable price. Suitable for everyone. Highly recommended."
ChIJlyy73ywmQg0RSJ2xg1fs9qs,5,"Great find while wandering‚Äîwhat luck! Really enjoyed the beer, tapas and helpful, friendly wait staff. They were so nice to offer a delicious sample of a shrimp, mushroom and creamy rice dish. Yum!!!
Wish I lived nearby. I would visit all the time."
ChIJlyy73ywmQg0RSJ2xg1fs9qs,5,This restaurant is an hidden gem. The place is delightful and aesthetic and the food was  good for a very cheap price. This is a must if you want to avoid tourist trap and enjoy Spanish food
ChIJlyy73ywmQg0RSJ2xg1fs9qs,5,An original and neat place with the nicest staff you can imagine. Fair prices and very good food. It is popular with locals. This place has a history and on the wall you'll see photos how it looked like at the corner of Embajadores some hundred years ago.
ChIJlyy73ywmQg0RSJ2xg1fs9qs,3,Food is quite nice but the staff is not really friendly. So despite the location and quality you might want to try another place
ChIJlyy73ywmQg0RSJ2xg1fs9qs,5,A caf√© restaurant that gave me the local experience where you can find a variety of Spanish food.
ChIJvzJ2j8wnQg0R3anSXb7d_Sc,5,"Welcoming staff, tasty food. I advise the solomilio.
Will come back for sure."
ChIJvzJ2j8wnQg0R3anSXb7d_Sc,5,"Absolutely amazing! Best food and flavor I had in Madrid. Most recommended. Small, cozy, and delicious."
ChIJvzJ2j8wnQg0R3anSXb7d_Sc,5,"This place is not about how it looks but how it tastes. Fish and meat were all great, generous portions. The desserts are delicious as well"
ChIJvzJ2j8wnQg0R3anSXb7d_Sc,5,Expectaculares fabada
ChIJvzJ2j8wnQg0R3anSXb7d_Sc,4,"The place upon entering did not convey the best of impressions, open kitchen and somewhat small and soulless next to the services. Narrow and busy bar and small dining room. In this case appearances deceived us because the food was delicious and the place filled up immediately. They give you the option of booking between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. or from 3:15 p.m. onwards. We went at 1:00 p.m. and at 2:00 p.m. the place was already full, there was not even room for a pin. Galician-style octopus for 10, delicious scallops for ‚Ç¨3 each, mussels and cockles of good size and fresh. 3 very rich crabs. They didn't have crab or beef. Tender and tasty garlic shrimp. Padr√≥n peppers at their point. In general, quality and fast product. Waiter not very talkative and serious but attentive and efficient. We did not order desserts, since we were very full. They have a coat rack."
ChIJA-NLMtcnQg0R4xZBjWGYg4w,5,Fabulous snails! Also had the pigs ears and trotters. Just amazing. Great service despite my halting Spanish. Would go every day!
ChIJA-NLMtcnQg0R4xZBjWGYg4w,5,"Came here with Tiana and Humonculus for a little edible sustenance.

Knowing me, I had to get the snails which were delicious as always. Both of these imbeciles refused to join me in collaborating on the snails, but they indulged in other traditional Madrid dishes that I have not pictured below.

Recently at work we have been exploring the relationship between snails and other snails, and initial investigations are proving fruitful (we feed them fruits).

All in all, a great experience in a staple of Cascorro culinary concoctions."
ChIJA-NLMtcnQg0R4xZBjWGYg4w,5,"This is such a great place to get authentic food. The staff didn‚Äôt speak English and I loved it. We had a chorizo sandwich, snails (what they‚Äôre famous for) and white vermouth and beer. All very reasonably priced. You must go."
ChIJA-NLMtcnQg0R4xZBjWGYg4w,1,"Closes @3:30 as per google and it's full of people eating when we walked in at 2:50pm and the worker points to the clock and says it's closed.  All that walk in the heat for nothing, very unwelcoming. We wanted to try their snails and came all the way from NYC."
ChIJA-NLMtcnQg0R4xZBjWGYg4w,5,"Authentic authentic authentic!

Sat here for two hours and was the only tourist!  Very cool and old school vibe.  I felt Spanish just being here haha.

The snails are slow cooked and served piping hot and the chorizo sandwich is affordable and stellar.

Give the Vermut Blanco a try for something new!

Highly recommend."
ChIJk3pLNs0nQg0R_m2tB2CMQ-s,4,"Only outdoor sitting (covered). Tables are not very stable. Caprese salad was good. Pizza was very thin- like a tortilla pizza, which we didn‚Äôt really like, bit the taste was ok. The price is a bit too high for the size of the pizza. You can only get medium sized pizza, not a large one."
ChIJk3pLNs0nQg0R_m2tB2CMQ-s,4,"A cute and quiet little spot to have dinner and enjoy the ambience of the neighbourhood. We ordered a Diavola and a Pineapple pizza  and they were both delicious and reasonably priced.

The only thing I would say is that the cokes we ordered were a little overpriced. However, it still turned out to be a very cheap and delicious dinner."
ChIJk3pLNs0nQg0R_m2tB2CMQ-s,5,"The waiter was very kind and gave a good attention. The menu is mostly Italian but one can also go there and take a beer while chilling. Depending on the time and day, you're gonna hear a lot of kids playing near the restaurant, so good thing if you like the environment or if you've got children.

3.40‚Ç¨ for a beer, that's on average ans I recommend it."
ChIJk3pLNs0nQg0R_m2tB2CMQ-s,5,"Best place to be on a hot afternoon in summer. The Sangrias are delicious, the people are nice and the atmosphere perfect to enjoy the time during the high temperatures. This restaurant is one of my highlights during my vacation in Madrid‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJk3pLNs0nQg0R_m2tB2CMQ-s,2,"For the past two years this has been my favourite place to order pizza from in Madrid. However, since about last year their service has become quiet slow.

Cannot fault their food, it is rather good. Yet please, solve your issues with delivery times. Otherwise I may need to look for another pizza site.

UPDATE: Ever since they started working with Just Eat, it's become worse. Just Eat blatantly lies that Pizza Margherita does not deliver to our area while Pizza Margherita does deliver it there themselves. I wish they would stop using these rip off services like Just Eat, Deliveroo etc. that overcharge restaurants and exploit people."
ChIJV0Ts3CwmQg0RYr2vsuO_E64,5,"Really good Indian food. Very kind service by Basir. Great portion of naan bread. And the curry was spiced really good.
Nothing but good things. Would really recommend!"
ChIJV0Ts3CwmQg0RYr2vsuO_E64,5,"Incredibly delicious Indian food... The best I've had in years. We ordered shrimp saag, lamb tikka pathi, garlic naan, and raita. The portions seem small (except the raita was huge) but are very filling by the time you add rice, and there were lots of shrimp in my dish. And I've never seen naan this fluffy!!!"
ChIJV0Ts3CwmQg0RYr2vsuO_E64,5,Really good restaurant with a great choice of Indian dishes. We come here regularly because the food is good and the service is quick. Many thanks to Basir for the always taking good care of us.
ChIJV0Ts3CwmQg0RYr2vsuO_E64,4,"Wasn't expecting too much but was super surprised . We had chicken balti with nan bread and it was absolutely delicious.  Rich tomato based curry with succulent boneless chicken . The nans  were also cooked to perfection .
I'm from Pakistani background and have been brought up on curry and I'm not exagerrating but I feel its one of the best curry's I've ever had."
ChIJV0Ts3CwmQg0RYr2vsuO_E64,5,"Good atmosphere, good food, good service, I highly recommend going, affordable prices and cleanliness."
ChIJJYV6XCUmQg0RK4FCK8iIjo8,3,"A bit overpriced for what you get, but okish‚Ä¶ first of all, wine from wine list we wanted they didn‚Äôt have (only one out of three rose was available, the one we didn‚Äôt prefer)‚Ä¶ fried anchovies - not available ‚Ä¶ calamari nice, seafood paella nice. You will have to put down a 20 EUR deposit when booking a table.

All in one, not bad and not specifically amazing."
ChIJJYV6XCUmQg0RK4FCK8iIjo8,5,"The absolute best meal I‚Äôve ever had. We had a group of 8 and every single item was Michelin Star level. Appetizers were prawns and chicharrones. You will never try anything as good in your life. We ordered multiple items and exchanged food and everything was more than amazing. It is pricey, but absolutely worth every penny. Go!"
ChIJJYV6XCUmQg0RK4FCK8iIjo8,5,"Just finished a great dinner! Am staying in hotel about 4 minute walk away. Found this resto seaching for ""seafood"" on g-maps. Shared salade especiale then the baked fish special for 2 that was a baked ""rubio"" or sea robin fish (see photo) with potatoes. Great wait staff and kitchen. Highly recommended."
ChIJJYV6XCUmQg0RK4FCK8iIjo8,5,"I much rather pay a little more for the fixed price menu and get a meal that is way above any other restaurant in 2 a mile radius. Please refer to my picture and compare with the thin entrecot served anywhere else. Excellent service and authentic Asturian cuisine, not for the faint of heart (huge portions). Enjoy!
Almost forgot to show you the ‚ÄúPaella‚Äù. Original from the Valencia region but known all across Spain. Is a seafood feast for your taste. Don‚Äôt miss it."
ChIJJYV6XCUmQg0RK4FCK8iIjo8,2,"The food came with a bandage ü©π on it. I don't think it was part of the recipe.
They redid the food and offered the desert. Lol.
The croquetas didn't taste that good either. But at least no bandage on them üôèüèº"
ChIJ01bKOiUmQg0RMZVrsXwQifE,5,"Just like stepping into 1920s. The restaurant is like traveling back in time, and it was an unforgettable experience. Recommended by a nearby hotel, the timeless ambiance started outside and continued as I entered. Despite being told reservations weren‚Äôt necessary for a Tuesday evening, the place was bustling even at 6:30 PM‚Äîearly by Spanish standards.

The wine list was remarkable, boasting over 10 pages of Spanish options. Unable to choose, I asked for a wine by the glass and was served a 6-year-old oak-aged delight. Amazing. The food was impressive: chorizo in wine gravy melted in my mouth, and the medium-rare Angus beef was tender and perfectly cooked.

The restaurant‚Äôs authenticity was heightened by locals enjoying traditional Spanish dishes, just like in the old Spanish village. The attentive staff went above and beyond, always around and very friendly.

This spot offers more than just a meal‚Äîit‚Äôs a cultural and gastronomic journey. A must-visit in Madrid, and a place I‚Äôd just return to Mardid for."
ChIJ01bKOiUmQg0RMZVrsXwQifE,3,Food is just okay. It was served quick but mostly subtle taste and way much oil. Great service and owner is very welcoming.
ChIJ01bKOiUmQg0RMZVrsXwQifE,5,"Fantastic local vibe that was clearly the place to be for lunch between 2-4 pm with very limited seating. Limited English speaking service but they do have an English menu. Hubby loved the chips with sardines and we had great egg dish, croquettes and chorizo!"
ChIJ01bKOiUmQg0RMZVrsXwQifE,5,"One of Madrid's emblematic eateries,  Bodegas Rosell dates back to the 1920s and maintains its historic look, with a beautiful tile fa√ßade and wooden interior. The menu centers on traditional Spanish dishes, most of which are meant to be shared. Having been here several times now, we've always had a great meal. Our favorites are the croquettes, the potatoes of granny Mercedes and the oxtail meatballs. The desserts are delicious as well. There's nothing fancy about the food served here‚Äîit's just really good down-home cooking. The place tends to be packed, especially on the weekends."
ChIJ01bKOiUmQg0RMZVrsXwQifE,4,"Met friend for drinks and some food. It's busy since 6 pm and hardly find a place to sit outside.
Croquetas are the best, so creamy and crispy. We tried jam√≥n/pollo/queso, each kind are highly recommended.
The later the more crowded came.
Service are good too.  If you are in the neighborhood, don't miss out!"
ChIJH-SluDAmQg0RXmfruERXlf8,5,Best pizza I've ever tasted.
ChIJH-SluDAmQg0RXmfruERXlf8,5,All you can eat for just 7.25‚Ç¨ (Includes drinks) is a good deal. The pizzas were good.
ChIJH-SluDAmQg0RXmfruERXlf8,1,"The buffet pricing is practical, but the service is appalling. You can't order the sort of crust you want; you have to obtain an original crust first, and then you may get the crust you want. If you order a family size pizza instead of two medium pizzas, you must do so on the second round of pizzas since the initial two medium pizzas are imposed upon you. I've been to other Domino's locations, and these regulations do not apply. If you wish to use your Edenred card to pay, this is the only Domino's that does not accept it.

Corporate should step in here and fix all the issues that are happening on this specific location."
ChIJH-SluDAmQg0RXmfruERXlf8,4,"This was my first time in this pizza shop and I didn't really know how it worked. But the person at the cashier treated me in the best possible way and helped me choose my food. With his recommendation I ordered two half pizzas and I really liked the taste. I got the medium size, which was a bit too big for one person, though. And the price seemed reasonable enough.
I will definitely repeat."
ChIJH-SluDAmQg0RXmfruERXlf8,5,"I had a dinner with a friend in Domino's. The staff is super friendly and understanding. Generally you get offers like in 14,50‚Ç¨ you get 2 classic medium pizzas(we ordered thin crust without extra cost) + unlimited soft drinks for 2 person. If you are close to Domino's, this deal is worthy enough to take it rather than getting pizza delivered at your place(18‚Ç¨ for 2 medium, without coke, without thin crust). The pizza was served hot and it is really delicious. I ordered a chicken pizza with mushrooms and onions. While ordering, staffs have some problem in speaking English(it is pretty normal in Spain) but the best part is that they try their best to make you feel comfortable. My experience at this place was awesome."
ChIJWcAUaS4mQg0RBJriOMBi34M,5,Excellent Thai food. This is the place that you must come  if you are looking for authentic Thai flavour. I have been a client here for almost 10 years !!
ChIJWcAUaS4mQg0RBJriOMBi34M,5,"Amazing authentic Thai food that‚Äôs even better than some of the restaurants in Bangkok. Personally the fish cake is a must try along with the Tom yang kung and the grilled sliced pork. The eyes are always hungrier than the quantity we can eat though;  and this time as there are only 2 of us we made sure we only order a few of the dishesüòö. This is a must try Thai restaurant, do not miss this if you are in Madrid!"
ChIJWcAUaS4mQg0RBJriOMBi34M,5,Best Khao Soi I‚Äôve had in Madrid - hands down! 10/10 experience and hard to find legit Thai cuisine in Europe. Also got the Pad Thai. I will be back!
ChIJWcAUaS4mQg0RBJriOMBi34M,5,"Brilliant Thai food! The dishes served up here are seriously flavoursome.
We had the fried chicken with Thai sauce to start - crispy and tender at the same time.
Then the yellow curry with pork which was bloody yummy as well as the crispy sweet chilli duck. The latter was one of the most enjoyable dishes I've had in Madrid. The meat was crispy and not too fatty, as duck can be, the sauce had a kick but also delicious sweetness, I'm pretty sure they use pineapple for the sweetness. Simply unreal. I'll put this in the Top 5 dishes in Madrid.
A big part of that claim is it's uniqueness. In a city full of buratta, croquetas and tiramisu this stands out.
Friendly service. Generous portions on the wine and in the end good value for money. The prices felt a little high on the menu but then when we paid up it didn't seem too expensive at all.
Most definitely will be back."
ChIJWcAUaS4mQg0RBJriOMBi34M,5,"As I am Thai, I can say that this is the best authentic Thai taste of the food from my country. Thai chef named, Pui added lots of fresh herbs making favors and aroma very full and aromatic. Presentation excellent. Please note: no credit card accepted."
ChIJY2wKxy8mQg0RMqV_cXQ_ZqA,5,"this is really good with delicious food! I recommend everyone to try the authentic Colombian food here! Almost everyone who dines here are locals. Therefore, you can tell how good the food here will be!"
ChIJY2wKxy8mQg0RMqV_cXQ_ZqA,4,"OMG, the minute I‚Äôve finished the food, I realised I didn‚Äôt take not even a single picture ! How‚Äôs that for a review?!????
Adding pictures of the interior and an empty desert cup.
Reservation in advance very much recommended! We didn‚Äôt have reservation and had to wait outside, even though the stuff was lovely, it took a while.
Which of course was worth it!"
ChIJY2wKxy8mQg0RMqV_cXQ_ZqA,4,Truly authentic experience with truly Colombian dishes. We say this because we went with two Colombians for lunch. Fruit milkshakes were great. Not many deserts as it‚Äôs not typical to order desert.
ChIJY2wKxy8mQg0RMqV_cXQ_ZqA,2,"Mediocre Colombian restaurant. Both the arepa and the patac√≥n are simplistic and underwhelming affairs. They boil down to a corn/plantain base topped with a massive chunk of dry meat. It's okay once you add one of the sauces offered, but the meat is just not good enough to be so much in the center of attention. Both dishes would be much better with a greater variety of toppings and a sauce that binds them together. Our starter (yuca) and dessert (arequipe) were good but not exciting. The best thing on the menu are the fruit juices. Prices are fine: we paid ‚Ç¨40 for two people. Won't be back, though."
ChIJY2wKxy8mQg0RMqV_cXQ_ZqA,5,"Patacon Pisao offers a delightful culinary journey through the heart of Colombia, delivering an authentic and flavorful experience that captures the essence of Colombian cuisine. Nestled in a vibrant atmosphere, the restaurant is a gem for those seeking a taste of South American delights, like being at home.

The show's star is undoubtedly the patron, a crispy plantain base topped with a tempting array of Colombian ingredients. From the traditional Patacon con Todo to the exotic Patacon Hawaiano, each dish showcases a perfect blend of textures and flavors, leaving your taste buds dancing with joy. The attention to detail in crafting these dishes is evident, with fresh ingredients and a commitment to authenticity.

The menu extends beyond patrons, offering a diverse selection of Colombian classics such as arepas, empanadas, and bandeja paisa. Each dish is a testament to Colombia's rich cultural tapestry, providing a well-rounded culinary experience.

The service at Patacon Pisao is warm and welcoming, adding to the overall enjoyment of the dining experience. The staff is knowledgeable and passionate, happy to guide you through the menu and share insights into Colombian culinary traditions. Try to book on weekends.

In conclusion, Patacon Pisao is a must-visit for anyone craving a genuine taste of Colombia. With its mouthwatering dishes, inviting ambiance, and attentive service, this restaurant earns its reputation as a culinary haven for lovers of South American cuisine in Madrid."
ChIJFzUrKSUmQg0R2lV31LBSldo,5,"I was starving for lunch and it was super hot outside.
The waiter waived me in and took me down to the super cool basement for lunch.

Service and food were great!
I had black risotto with octopus (not a Summer dish).
Loved it!"
ChIJFzUrKSUmQg0R2lV31LBSldo,3,A bit sterile and characterless but an ok place that's inexpensive
ChIJFzUrKSUmQg0R2lV31LBSldo,5,"Not a stuning place inside, but stunning ""cuisine"" in your plate. Very warm welcome, service is perfect, helpful staff to feel comfortable.
Prices absolutely correct regarding the quality.
I highly recommend the place."
ChIJFzUrKSUmQg0R2lV31LBSldo,5,"Wow, The food here was amazing i had the Rosario salad which had a perfect amount of olive oil, balsamic vinegar. Then as an entr√©e i had the Risotto which was outstanding and my brother got the Burger Bull which i had a great deal of and i can say it was the greatest burger of my life i greatly recommend stopping here on your trip in Madrid"
ChIJFzUrKSUmQg0R2lV31LBSldo,1,"I was just wondering how can this  El Rosario get a 4.4 star on Google reviews. I ordered a choto dish from the menu. Before ordering, I confirmed that choto is baby lamb. But they served pork, I confronted that. They answered yes this is the pork, not choto. but they billed me as choto for 17.95 euro, not the pork only 11 euro something. They know I order the choto. They know they gave me the pork. But they charge me for the choto dish price.
Additionally, they billed 6 euro for a starter priced 5 euro on menu and billed 3 euro for ¬†4 pieces of bread which we didn't order.
The day before this dinner, we went to a restaurant just across the street called Bodegas Rosell. I ordered a grilled baby lamb rib dish that was very nice and costed only 14 euro. The place was very busy and crowded.
Tonight, ¬†El Rosario was very quiet with no customers. I saw online that El Rosario had a 4.4 star review and was even higher than Bodegas Rosell reviews. I expected good service but instead received some rip-off."
ChIJ4Qs4SS4mQg0RXoylbE2o33U,5,"The food was excellent and portions were very big. We were three having dinner and we took ceviche, encebollado and pork ribs. I think we all were very satisfied with our choices and we shared a cake at the end that was also very good.  The service was good, yet a bit shy and the chairs of the table a bit uncomfortable. However for the quality of the food and price you pay the value is high, plus you get to eat something new out of the regular market mainstream. These people are doing it well and good effort in sharing their food culture in Madrid which is very competitive with food in general. Thank you."
ChIJ4Qs4SS4mQg0RXoylbE2o33U,5,"Reminds me of my grandmother cooking, truly felt like I was back home eating good homemade food. Thank you for the lovely experience and will definitely recommend anyone who is trying authentic Ecuadorian food."
ChIJ4Qs4SS4mQg0RXoylbE2o33U,3,"Value for money super fare. Traditional ecuatorian food, preparation is pretty original and the options in the menu are plenty.
The portions are massive and the ingredients are well prepared.
The only con is that the people in the kitchen does not use their masks in the proper way, big watch out for the managers.
The vegan options are not available in the many but you can ask for any plate without the animal component."
ChIJ4Qs4SS4mQg0RXoylbE2o33U,4,The food was super yummy. On this cold rainy day the beans and ric were like a hug from home. We loved our meal. Restaurant full with locals. We were amazingly content!
ChIJ4Qs4SS4mQg0RXoylbE2o33U,4,I was taken to this restaurant by a couple of friends who are from Quito. It is simply fantastic! Not sure it is good for dinner since it might be a bit too much. Food is amazing and the price is actually on the low side! The place is not top...hence the four stars instead of five.
ChIJmQKyyC4mQg0RhfVjmzxTrKQ,5,"OMG! What food, and in a city where standards are high! It's Galician, so no suprise that the tuna empanada was wonderful. The squid croquetes were unforgettably delicious, and the octopus a feira was every bit as good. I'll be eating at this restaurant again!"
ChIJmQKyyC4mQg0RhfVjmzxTrKQ,5,I ate here 2 of my 3 nights in Spain. What a wonderful restaurant. Excellent food a mind blowing wine selection with great wines on tap and passionate friendly helpful service.  HIGHLY recommended
ChIJmQKyyC4mQg0RhfVjmzxTrKQ,5,"I honestly loved this restaurant! It was tucked away in a small street, the atmosphere was amazing, it felt comfortable to sit in, and I just loved the food. The food was the best food I have had in Madrid! The service was absolutely incredible! The waiter was so nice, and polite! A few tips would to be to go during lunch is to get the set menu for lunch and to make a reservation as the lounge area does fill up very fast!"
ChIJmQKyyC4mQg0RhfVjmzxTrKQ,5,Octopus here üêô is just perfection üëå. Quick service with a smile. Really tasty beer. Just a really nice place. Cool atmosphere. Great menu options. Definitely won‚Äôt regret stopping in.
ChIJmQKyyC4mQg0RhfVjmzxTrKQ,4,"Excellent food, great ambience and fair prices. The chipirones Croquetas are the best one I've ever tasted, they're a must!

The service could be friendlier, tho. The last two times I've visited the service was amazing. Last night well... Not so much."
ChIJvXmWmiwmQg0RQUt3MPyVBYY,5,Cute little place with good homey food. Both the chicken and shepherd‚Äôs pie were really satisfying. Wish we could eat more but it was physically impossible. Will definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu!
ChIJvXmWmiwmQg0RQUt3MPyVBYY,5,The food was great and staff was very nice. Good atmosphere and good price for the food. (Also one of the guys spoke great English which was extremely helpful!)
ChIJvXmWmiwmQg0RQUt3MPyVBYY,5,"Two guys running this lovely little cafe/bar/restaurant. One of them speaks perfect English, he might even be English.

I stopped here when I had 3 hours in Madrid to kill and it was perfect. Menu del Dia very reasonably priced with the best coffee to finish. The cod on big potatoes was delicious and felt very healthy compared to some more traditional Menu del Dias.

Only critique is that it was a little over salted. They do give you a litre of ice cold water along with your complimentary drink so you won‚Äôt go thirsty.

Lavapies is a great neighbourhood and when I‚Äôm back I‚Äôll definitely visit Los Chuchis again!"
ChIJvXmWmiwmQg0RQUt3MPyVBYY,4,"Me and some friends went here last weekend in a tracking down of the quintessential English Sunday roast. The five of us have been living in Madrid over the last couple of months and we were looking for a taste of home. Los Chuchis is an English cuisine-inspired bar in central Madrid serving a variety of dishes as part of a menu del d√≠a. We were given a choice of four starters (pate, roasted potato skins +2 more that I can't remember) and four mains (roast pork, roast chicken, fish soup, veggie curry). We all opted to go for just the roast pork. With a drink included this was 13.50‚Ç¨, but it would have been 10.50‚Ç¨ during the week.

The pork was absolutely delicious. It was perhaps a little stingy on the potatoes and lacked other accompaniments but the texture was fantastic, it came with a gorgeous piece of crackling and a bit of apple sauce on the side. Delicious, we all really enjoyed! The plate seemed a bit small at first but we all seemed to be absolutely knackered after polishing off our plates... and I'm sure we would have been even more stuffed had we had a first course as well.

The decor was cute and the staff were friendly. Most only speak Spanish but one of the waiters was English. I will definitely be coming back, and next time I will be going midweek, due to it being cheaper, and will be having both first and second courses i.e. the full menu. Looking forward to it!"
ChIJvXmWmiwmQg0RQUt3MPyVBYY,5,"I booked a dinner for three at this restaurant. I have to say, I've lived in the UK in the past and I really enjoy British food. But the dishes served in this restaurant are better than most of the meals that I've tried in average British pubs. We ordered three dishes (grilled camembert, fried potato scraps and the shepherds pie) and we enjoyed every las bit of them. The rations were large enough for the three of us to be perfectly satisfied. We also tried two desserts and both were outstanding: none of them felt too sweet, but they were tasty and really original for us.
The staff was really friendly, efficient without rushing the customers. And they have some imported British beers that will feel like heaven for those who seek this kind of drink. The music and general atmosphere is one of the best in the area: the place never felt too noisy or uncomfortable, even with all its tables occupied.
We absolutely loved our dinner at Los Chuchis and we'll surely be back."
ChIJe-7r4y0mQg0Rb3eG-umwW7Q,5,"Our family came here twice during our vacation. We really enjoyed the warm hospitality (the staff is primarily Spanish speaking - the menu is limited in English descriptions) and the delicious food. We speak a little bit of Spanish which helped tremendously.
The quality of all the fresh fish, steaks, jam√≥n, and salads were fantastic and well worth the price! Portions are generous for sharing between us 5. It does get quite busy at dinnertime so it is worth making a reservation. The complimentary tapas at the beginning changes each day. It is a wonderful place and we hope to visit again :)"
ChIJe-7r4y0mQg0Rb3eG-umwW7Q,5,"One of our favorite neighborhood restos, frequented by many fabulous local seniors who seem to all know each other. That‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs good. Go early by Spanish standards at 1pm so you can get a table or else it gets full.

The waitstaff have obviously worked there forever and we even have a favorite who speaks Spanish, English and French. But the rest speak mostly Spanish so it is a big help that my husband speaks Spanish.

We usually go during lunch time because the Menu del Dia is only 20 euros per person for bread, 1 drink, 2 plates & dessert. The servings are generous. I‚Äôll be placing the name of each item we ordered in the photos, but the stand outs were:

- Gambas al ajillo - This is a must everytime we go here. It‚Äôs a separate starter but the best in our opinion, even better than the one featured in the Madrid episode of Somebody Feed Phil. Comes super hot, and you need to move it around to evenly cook it. Be sure to dip into the oil & pile on the garlic bits!
- Lentejas con Chorizo - my husband enjoyed this
- Patatas Revolconas - hearty and yummy for chorizo lovers
- Filete de Ternera a la Plancha - my steak loving son was happy
- Salmon a la Plancha - for me the best thing on the menu during the day we went. Perfectly cooked and super fresh! Even the salad was yummy.
- Tarta de Zanahoria con Helado - moist carrot cake with ice cream YUM
- Tarta helada contessa - my son‚Äôs loved this chocolate and vanilla ice cream cake
- Fresas con Nata - sweet strawberries with delicious whipped cream. Definitely not from a can.
- We paired desserts with a cortado (Spanish espresso basically). The perfect end to a generous meal.

As a plus, the paintings in the restaurant are absolutely beautiful. I‚Äôm not much of a fan of still life but the ones they have and the landscape paintings are so vivid and stunning."
ChIJe-7r4y0mQg0Rb3eG-umwW7Q,5,"Highly recommend the delicious food and extra friendly service! We ate there twice during our short stay in Madrid, and both times were (generous) delights!

P.S: you have to try the octopus!"
ChIJe-7r4y0mQg0Rb3eG-umwW7Q,5,"Went here for our first dinner in Spain. Although the waiter and staff only spoke Spanish, everyone was very friendly and accommodating. The food was very fresh and had excellent flavors. Would highly recommend each of the dishes that we ordered. Definitely go!"
ChIJe-7r4y0mQg0Rb3eG-umwW7Q,5,"We were staying in the area and decided to try it out based on the great reviews. The place definitely had a very comfortable local feel and the staff was very friendly. We didn't speak Spanish and they didn't have an English menu but our waitress did her best to help us and got us everything we wanted. We were given some croquettes and sausage as an amuse bouche which was delicious. We ordered the garlic shrimp, a grilled pork sandwich, the braised ox tail and grilled lamb chops and all our food were fantastic. I had the ox tail and the meat was just ready to fall off the bone and coated in a rich thick sauce and I really enjoyed it. We finished the meal with some shots to celebrate as it was near the end of our trip and we couldn't have asked for a better way to wrap up our vacation."
ChIJbWY0BTImQg0RPOD9GZWlfwo,5,"If you want to eat Cuban cuisine you should totally visit this place. The food was delicious and the staff were very friendly. I drank there the best mojito I've ever drank in my life - it's strong and tasty, exactly how a mojito should taste like. The waiters were friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was excellent- you can hear the Cuban music playing in the background and you can look at some photos from Cuba hanging on the walls. I totally recommend this place!!!"
ChIJbWY0BTImQg0RPOD9GZWlfwo,5,"We first went to this restaurant in 2014 and a lot had changed but each time we go to Madrid we always eat here once or twice. We are so lucky my MIL has this in her hood.

We always order the same things. Names are in the photos."
ChIJbWY0BTImQg0RPOD9GZWlfwo,5,"The food is absolutely delicious‚Äîespecially the Ropa Vieja, which is rich, tender, and full of flavor. The shredded beef of the ropa vieja is simply out of this world, perfectly seasoned. On top of that, the service is outstanding‚Äîthe owners make you feel like royalty with their warmth and hospitality. My only wish is that the rice were a bit fresher to fully complement the incredible flavors of the meat and fried plantains. Overall, a must-visit spot for authentic Cuban cuisine in Madrid!"
ChIJbWY0BTImQg0RPOD9GZWlfwo,5,"If you want authentic Cuban food, come here Amazing place, great food and service, Rafael was very friendly. Highly recommended"
ChIJbWY0BTImQg0RPOD9GZWlfwo,5,"Authentic Cuban restaurant, the best we've tried in Madrid. The avocado with shrimp and r√©moulade is fantastic, as is the ""ropa vieja"" (shredded beef stew, a Cuban classic). Delicious homemade desserts, above all the cheesecake topped with guava. Plenty of outdoor seating."
ChIJ98izQS4mQg0RMMHTObPZu_I,3,Came for food at 5:30pm and was told there isn‚Äôt any food till 7pm. Got a coffee and a beer. Atmosphere is pretty dull. Really wanted to find a authentic Spanish bar but unfortunately this wasn‚Äôt it.
ChIJ98izQS4mQg0RMMHTObPZu_I,5,"Everything was closed and we tried this place out. The service was excellent, they offer you several types of tapas to choose from, we had 2 rounds, the tapas were very good, first tapa was croquetas, and the second tapa was an excelent ""sandwich mixto"". The beer was very cold. Fast service.  We will return."
ChIJ98izQS4mQg0RMMHTObPZu_I,2,"Not so much options of crouquetas in this croqueteria :) I want to try some new flavours, some new vege croqetas. We order also berenjena con miel de cana (disaster, not worth a cent). I was disappointed. I don't recommend."
ChIJ98izQS4mQg0RMMHTObPZu_I,1,"The guy serving was in a hurry all the time but the service was slow as hell, even though there was only one other table occupied at the time. He came, asked for our drinks and my dad couldn't understand so he turned around and left to go smoke and for the next 20 minutes he kept doing that and being rude as hell! After we all order we waited for what seemed like hours while he came and went to smoke and as the plates came (all at different times) it was ok sandwiches, nothing spectacular but after all the waiting he comes and asks me what I had order, even though he had the electronic order app, which he was really slow with (writing the order down would have been much faster)!! So basically I waited hours for rude service and an ok toast..."
ChIJ98izQS4mQg0RMMHTObPZu_I,4,"Always a good option if you're looking for home accessories, decorations, small furniture,table dressing, bed dressing, anything like that they have some really cool storage boxes too, that come in different patterns and sizes, and the nicest kitchen ware around. At sensible prices."
ChIJX9SB6TAmQg0Rw-xgWSFvcnc,5,"We ate breakfast here every day while staying at a nearby hotel, and really enjoyed it.
Good coffee, lovely selection of pastries and freshly squeezed orange juice. All at good prices.
Many other breakfast options are also available.
The cafe is clean, smart and spacious. The staff are friendly and very helpful. It gets busy but the staff are quietly efficient. They clearly have a lot of regular local customers as well as tourists like us.
I just wish there was a place like this near my home!"
ChIJX9SB6TAmQg0Rw-xgWSFvcnc,5,"This panaderia is not fancy in terms of decor, but the butter croissants are large, purely delicious, and super affordable.  Breakfast for 2 (2 butter croissants, 2 coffees) is less than 4 euros. The tables are very well spaced, and there is good fresh air flow from the street, for those concerned about Covid distancing."
ChIJX9SB6TAmQg0Rw-xgWSFvcnc,5,"Best croissants I have tasted in my life. Amazing coffee, really pleasant and friendly staff. Cozy atmosphere. Amazing place."
ChIJX9SB6TAmQg0Rw-xgWSFvcnc,5,"What a great place! It is a perfect venue to enjoy brunch. One can clearly see how good these bakers are.

Carmen, Juan and Jeanca run the place, and they took care of every detail from the very moment I came through the door.

I highly recommend ‚Äòtarta de tres leches‚Äô y ‚Äòpan de jam√≥n‚Äô. Don‚Äôt leave Madrid before paying them a visit!"
ChIJX9SB6TAmQg0Rw-xgWSFvcnc,5,This isn't the tourist place but very smoothy local bakery for breakfast. Cost of breakfast (hot drink and croissants) approx. 5 euro.
ChIJg-IcUjAmQg0ReG3fYAVSG0s,4,"It's cheap pleasurable junk food and beer. That's what makes this place an excellent meetup for a weekend outing with friends. There are a ton of food options.  You can spend as little as you want. It's easy to fill up and there's a decent amount of seating. The service is slow and the seats are uncomfortable but it's all part of the package.
I choose this place again and again when the right moment arises."
ChIJg-IcUjAmQg0ReG3fYAVSG0s,1,"It is cheap yes, but no reason for food to be so bad. I ordered the hamburger and a ceasar salad. I am sorry, if you are desperate and on an impossible budget and cannot afford anything else, yes go there, but if you respect your taste buds at all, run away, so not worth it!! I took one bite and left, waste of money"
ChIJg-IcUjAmQg0ReG3fYAVSG0s,5,"a must try when you're in madrid! especially on sunday for the euromania :) cheap, fast & very tasty! they have a lot of veggie options too. definitely try the delicious tinto de verano"
ChIJg-IcUjAmQg0ReG3fYAVSG0s,4,"You really can't go wrong with tapas (100 choices!) for between ‚Ç¨1 and ‚Ç¨2 (with a couple of dishes for a Euro or so more) and half a litre of beer for ‚Ç¨2.

The food was good and the service was great. There are plenty of seats and nice enough decor. On good days, there is outside seating, too. Aseos decent, too."
ChIJg-IcUjAmQg0ReG3fYAVSG0s,5,4 drinks for 11 euros what more can I say...
ChIJrbq7Ai4mQg0R28cwA5KCX_Y,5,"This place is fantastic in terms of fresh produces! Although it isn‚Äôt as well-known to tourists as other markets, I find this place encapsulates all the essence of Spanish awesomeness! Non-Spanish speaking tourists should be able to get by without much troubles!"
ChIJrbq7Ai4mQg0R28cwA5KCX_Y,5,"This market is fabulous! If you can't find what you're looking for in food or drink here, it doesn't exist. The produce is all first rate; the service is excellent and helpful. There is even a vegan diner! This is where the true Madrile√±os shop."
ChIJrbq7Ai4mQg0R28cwA5KCX_Y,5,"It was so nice to get to a proper market. So many markets in Madrid are dying or being turned into hipster food halls. This one is full of fresh produce and cheese and preserves. And meat, fish, croquettes etc.
There is a good French cheese shop and a fabulous Spanish cheese shop, La Boutique Del Queso. The man there spoke good English and was just so kind and helpful. He has a great change and let me taste many cheeses."
ChIJrbq7Ai4mQg0R28cwA5KCX_Y,5,"Great mercado, has everything you could possibly want. The stall owner are super lovely and friendly too."
ChIJrbq7Ai4mQg0R28cwA5KCX_Y,5,"Great place. Typical ""barrio"" ambience. You can find almost everything you need in terms of grocery shopping, including fresh meat, fish, and produce.
There are also, shoe repair, beauty parlour, etc. Places.
Conveniently situated in the heart of Arganzuela Burrow, close to Atocha-RENFE, rail station."
ChIJGSpu2DEmQg0RcxTYjFtCzMg,5,"I loved the place, the service was very fast, the people who run the place were very friendly, the food was delicious, perfect for breakfast and starting the day."
ChIJGSpu2DEmQg0RcxTYjFtCzMg,5,"Attention of 10, very good people and I hope that my review helps you to always have people.
I did a one-week course, breakfast and snack, all the sandwiches very well made and served.

I have to make special mention of the ham, it is a vice.

I wish you the best."
ChIJGSpu2DEmQg0RcxTYjFtCzMg,5,"Excellent treatment and good service. They put a good skewer with the consumption, they vary. Highly recommended."
ChIJGSpu2DEmQg0RcxTYjFtCzMg,5,"Great place for breakfast, they have some fleas that they prepare on the spot. The service is very fast and attentive. I also go there on Tuesdays to have an aperitif for their revolconasüòã."
ChIJGSpu2DEmQg0RcxTYjFtCzMg,5,Perfect place to have breakfast. It is always super delicious and at affordable prices. But the best is the waiters who are super nice!!
ChIJqayqIzAmQg0R9-Wg-zeIWVI,5,"Excellent place to get churros, sandwiches and everything in between. I've tried their churros con chocolate, very fresh and delicious. Their tea is great too.
Would highly recommend for a quick evening bite or a breakfast plan. Do try their bagels, queso sandwiches (for quite cheap),  and chocolate pastry."
ChIJqayqIzAmQg0R9-Wg-zeIWVI,5,One of the finest Croissants that I have had is at this place. And i got introduced to Macha Latte at this place. So it holds a special place in my mind... Loved the variety and the quality of the food ...
ChIJqayqIzAmQg0R9-Wg-zeIWVI,3,Ok for quick coffee
ChIJqayqIzAmQg0R9-Wg-zeIWVI,5,Food here is amazing and cheap.
ChIJqayqIzAmQg0R9-Wg-zeIWVI,4,"Recently refurbished, this bar offers a cosy and fresh interior with a wide range of sandwiches, wraps and salads. There's no place like Rodilla and the quality is very nice. Their menus are great value for money and they sometimes have some limited edition sandwiches to bring some variety on the menu."
ChIJsx8o8jomQg0R-zhF5ZKISpE,5,"Absolutely THE BEST experience, value for money and superb service. 3 course menu with beer @ amazing price. You can't wish for more! If you like local, peaceful and great place in Madrid don't look any further. You've got it!"
ChIJsx8o8jomQg0R-zhF5ZKISpE,5,Excellent food at reasonable day menu price 13euros.
ChIJsx8o8jomQg0R-zhF5ZKISpE,5,Perfect 3 course meal for 12 euros!
ChIJsx8o8jomQg0R-zhF5ZKISpE,3,"I walked by and decided to stop for lunch. The server was friendly, but inattentive. I received an entire bottle of wine after asking for a glass of wine, and she didn‚Äôt bring a wine glass or any way to open the wine, so it just sat on my table while I ate a delicious potato dish, followed by a dry chicken dish.

I tried three times to get her attention to bring my check, before I finally walked inside and asked the man at the bar if I could pay."
ChIJsx8o8jomQg0R-zhF5ZKISpE,5,"Excellent value for money!! Two meals, dessert and a drink for $ 11 euro.
Food was fresh and tasty.
I just felt sorry for the waiter, he was basically serving the whole restaurant on his own :("
ChIJeXE7hDomQg0RRMM6tg7t2EI,5,Delicious meal. Friendly staff. It is a bar and restaurant in one. Dont be put off by the bar/games at the entrance. Get a table and enjoy the meal. There is also a daily menu. Highly recommended.
ChIJeXE7hDomQg0RRMM6tg7t2EI,2,"The food is ok, but it is overpriced and our Zamburinas were wayyyy overcooked.  The service is incredibly slow. So slow that we waited 1.5 hours for setas that never came, so we cancelled the order and asked for our check (which took another 20 minutes). It wasn't busy, just slow. I don't recommend... There are better, more affordable restaurants nearby."
ChIJeXE7hDomQg0RRMM6tg7t2EI,5,Delicious food and very nice service!
ChIJeXE7hDomQg0RRMM6tg7t2EI,4,"Traditional local Spanish restaurant and bar, with great service and good menu options. Bar and restaurant is about 50/50 split. Pulpo de Gallego estuvo muyi rico!"
ChIJeXE7hDomQg0RRMM6tg7t2EI,5,"A very interesting local place with good seafood and very enthusiastic service. Three couples dining together ate plenty, for a very reasonable price."
ChIJO6WXyS8mQg0RxwB2xT0neqU,5,"The owner is really nice, he explains in details all about artesanal beers, how the flavor is gained and what is used to make it, he charges you for the beer and if you take it in the shop he charges 1‚Ç¨ per person for some cheesballs, the glass and the right of a table."
ChIJO6WXyS8mQg0RxwB2xT0neqU,1,"Charges up to 3‚Ç¨ to drink bottles inside the store. While they do have a selection of different beers in bottles, you may be better off drinking one of the 10 they have on tap (as they have no additional costs). Will offer you tapas with your pints as is customary in many places in Madrid, but they will try to charge you for them when you leave. Just doesn‚Äôt make sense. No English spoken."
ChIJO6WXyS8mQg0RxwB2xT0neqU,4,"A tidy bit small, not loud enough music and some help could have been appreciated with the tables. Otherwise, it has a nice selection of beers and a good ambience."
ChIJO6WXyS8mQg0RxwB2xT0neqU,1,Arrived at 2210 tonight and they were closed. Not a soul in sight. :(
ChIJO6WXyS8mQg0RxwB2xT0neqU,5,Excellent selection of beers. One of the best places to enjoy a good beer in barrio delicias.
ChIJcZKzAzAmQg0RMAyhdptIRGs,5,Service is great. Very good at interpreting English and broken Spanish. Very friendly awesome staff. Food was So good. Tapas a re good. Rib steak was great and large portions. Grilled pawns are so good. Seems like a favorite for locals and I highly recommend for travelers.
ChIJcZKzAzAmQg0RMAyhdptIRGs,5,"Nice little tapas bar we walked past while looking for somewhere to eat. Stopped and had some great food and drinks.
It's Spanish, so helps if you can speak a little bit, or have Google translate handy.
Would definitely go again."
ChIJcZKzAzAmQg0RMAyhdptIRGs,5,Agustine was amazing. He knew we were lost and how to order and he suggested some amazing choices and my kids loved .
ChIJcZKzAzAmQg0RMAyhdptIRGs,1,"We reserved via the fork. When we arrived it was told to us that they wasnt accepting reservations and cancelled our reserve. We checked again on app and they were stilling accepting reserves, it feeled like a bait. We end up seating and they presented us a more expensive menus and we didnt feel like welcomed at all. End up leaving without dine"
ChIJcZKzAzAmQg0RMAyhdptIRGs,5,"Popular bar with welcoming staff, classic interiors with football, Guinness and slot machines. Lots of local wines. We stopped for drinks, were served large portions of tapas. Frequented by locals and regulars, appears family run."
ChIJscsRmDomQg0RvF7Bz0m9PYU,5,Super dominican bar restaurant
ChIJscsRmDomQg0RvF7Bz0m9PYU,5,"I dined here this past December while visiting Madrid. I'm back in Madrid and was reminded of how good it was as I walked past it. It's Dominican so not your typical Spanish dishes but equally delicious if not better. Also, they have spicy salsa on the side which is very rare in Spain yet my favorite flavor booster having grown up on multiple Mexican salsas (: I highly recommend La Brasa. The food is excellent, the people are warm and the atmosphere is welcoming."
ChIJscsRmDomQg0RvF7Bz0m9PYU,5,A good place to eat and listen to good bachata all day.
ChIJscsRmDomQg0RvF7Bz0m9PYU,1,"Incredible, a plate of white rice, two fried eggs, very poorly fried, and some frozen potatoes plus a soft drink = 16 euros. For what you pay, this is garbage, you can eat a full menu in any bar."
ChIJscsRmDomQg0RvF7Bz0m9PYU,1,"A robbery... That's what it was, for a plate of rice, a few FROZEN potatoes and two boiled eggs = 16 euros! For less you have a complete menu in any bar."
ChIJN0Y6Uy4mQg0RwQ0szfDkmCU,5,"We loved this restaurant as it was close to our accommodation in Madrid. The food was authentic Indian and my husband fell in love with their Chicken Tikka that come out sizzling hot, very moist and delicious. There‚Äôs a nice touch of a complimentary glass of a liqueur at the end of the meal. We visited them 3 times during our stay and they didn‚Äôt disappoint us. The staff - Amenu, Hasan and Abdul are all lovely."
ChIJN0Y6Uy4mQg0RwQ0szfDkmCU,4,"We were the first customers when the restaurant opened at 7:30, so there wasn't much atmosphere.  I had the Chicken Garlic Chilli and my wife had the Chicken Korma .  The sauces were excellent, the chicken just a little less tender than we get in our favorite curry shops.  I would definitely go back if in the area."
ChIJN0Y6Uy4mQg0RwQ0szfDkmCU,4,"Solid food, affordable, good service. The restaurant is larger than it seems, so finding a table shouldn't be too hard. The lamb tandoori was a favorite, but the butter chicken lacked tomato sauce (I'm sure there are multiple versions of this recipe, I just like the zesty version better)"
ChIJN0Y6Uy4mQg0RwQ0szfDkmCU,5,Very hospitable and helpful staff   Genuinely nice people. The mains came quickly this may or may not be to your liking.
ChIJN0Y6Uy4mQg0RwQ0szfDkmCU,5,Love everything üòç perfect please for Indian food in Madrid! üíØ pretty valuable ü•ò
ChIJewAihSUmQg0RFuy-Rzya_mo,5,"Great local restaurant, delicious food and very friendly staff who were happy to accommodate us with English menus."
ChIJewAihSUmQg0RFuy-Rzya_mo,4,"The server speaks good English and provided us with an English language menu. The food was decent, tasty, and arrived quickly. A combination plate cost about 14 Euro and was decently filling."
ChIJewAihSUmQg0RFuy-Rzya_mo,5,"This is the best place in atocha Madrid.
I had a racion of ""callos a la madrilena"" another racion of ""albondigas caseras "" . This is the real taste of Spain.
I had 3 pints of beer and a shot of orujo from Galicia....this is heaven.....!
There's a very professional man who runs the place, who invited me to another shot of orujo...this is the best place in Madrid, I swear...! You have to come here...!
After all, I paid 40 euros......feel like I'm robbing them...!"
ChIJewAihSUmQg0RFuy-Rzya_mo,5,"I looked for a place to eat inside Etosha  station and everything there was dark and unappealing so I walked out and saw this lovely traditional Madrile√±an cafe restaurant and it was such a breather. Great light, very friendly and welcome staff, great menu (salmon was delicious) and good value. I highly recommend the place. Thank you"
ChIJewAihSUmQg0RFuy-Rzya_mo,1,"Opening times until midnight. You walk in at 22:20 and they day they are closing‚Ä¶

Next door, people are happily having dinner and being served although they ‚Äòclose‚Äô earlier‚Ä¶ I see here a lack of interest to have customers.

Hence the bad reviews. Good news is: there are plenty of other better places."
ChIJjRX4kBcmQg0RC9bGOuAEt4U,4,"The food here was an experience to enjoy. Unique plates, staff was friendly and service was quick. The quality of the food was great and definitely a revist to try more of their pescado."
ChIJjRX4kBcmQg0RC9bGOuAEt4U,5,"Excellent restaurant. I ordered the menu del dia, it was calamries with rice which were excellent."
ChIJjRX4kBcmQg0RC9bGOuAEt4U,4,Very nice Paella Alicantino 32‚Ç¨ for two persons‚Ä¶
ChIJjRX4kBcmQg0RC9bGOuAEt4U,1,"The food was ok (the rice is not even close to other restaurants in Madrid) but the metre is a suited up racist snob who treated us like we were turning down the non existent glamour of the place.
We addressed him politely when he rudely tried to kick us out and all we got in return was ""yeah whatever"" in front of all other customers! I was so humilliated I couldn't speak back.
Fortunately my father in law has come to Spain previously and spared me the embarrasment of explaining we are not like this guys.
If you are not spanish and planning to wear a tie and high heels you definitely should avoid this restaurant."
ChIJjRX4kBcmQg0RC9bGOuAEt4U,4,Good relation quality price. Nice to test different paellas. Not so good service and wine menu
ChIJyw-xETwmQg0R11k78QGWixk,1,"After doing a lot of searching on google maps, I was optimistic about this place (since you can‚Äôt really mess up pasta, let‚Äôs be real). Burrata was ok. Caesar salad (refer to pic) was DOUSED in dressing, I‚Äôve truly never had dressing served with a side of spinach‚Ä¶couldn‚Äôt even scrape off the extra sauce because it was smothered. The bolognese was SO incredibly salty, had maybe 2 bites then refused to eat anymore because our appetite was lost and disappointed at that point. I told the waiter and he said the cook made a mistake but that he already left for the night so there was nothing to be done, didn‚Äôt even offer to take it off the bill."
ChIJyw-xETwmQg0R11k78QGWixk,5,"The Jobstoday.world team tried Il Boccone for the first time at their monthly lunch and we were very happy!

The service was very pleasant and all the food was delicious. We especially liked the burrata. As you can see in the pictures, it was amazing! The desserts were also delicious. You can really taste the Mediterranean flavour of Italy from the beginning. The pasta is made just the way it should be!

We would also like to highlight the ambience of the place. We really liked the lighting and the decoration and the waiters were very nice to us. We will definitely return!"
ChIJyw-xETwmQg0R11k78QGWixk,5,"This is by far the best Italian food in Madrid. There is no competition on this. I lived in Madrid for 2 1/2 years and worked down the street from il boccone. Went every Friday for 18 months. Seriously!  Now I‚Äôve moved away but come back every so often. Got in the last day before their Christmas break. The fresh pasta and bolognese was perfect, the eggplant parmigiana amazing. All this with a hearty Sicilian red wine. And the tiramisu and cannolo were spectacular. On top of it all, the staff is super friendly, remember med me after a years absence and made us feel at home. This place is so close to Atocha rail station that you can squeeze it in when passing through Madrid!"
ChIJyw-xETwmQg0R11k78QGWixk,1,We ate yesterday for lunch here and my husband got a very bad food poisoning - we had to go to the emergency room. He had the volcano pasta with pesto and definitely something was bad in it. We will never be back here.
ChIJyw-xETwmQg0R11k78QGWixk,5,Excelle T food the waitress was really patience with us.
ChIJV4P_0D0mQg0RVYc-qsPEjhk,4,"It's a nice place to enjoy some American burgers, french fries and shakes could be better but nice ambience and overall a decent place to hang out with your amigos. Recommendable!"
ChIJV4P_0D0mQg0RVYc-qsPEjhk,4,If you like hamburgers this is a good place. They serve a variety of options based on meat and chicken.
ChIJV4P_0D0mQg0RVYc-qsPEjhk,4,"I went to this bbq burger on a weekday with seven other office colleagues for team lunch. I tried times square burger. Fries, burger and drinks were a go-for-it combo. Visited multiple times with the love for burgers near my office."
ChIJV4P_0D0mQg0RVYc-qsPEjhk,4,"We ordered food to take away in this place. The burgers are delicious - the meat is juicy, sauces are good. However, the ""patatas asadas"" left me very disappointed: 2 huge pieces of potato, undercooked, with a bit of spices on top. If I saw it in the restaurant I'd have asked for replacement :("
ChIJV4P_0D0mQg0RVYc-qsPEjhk,5,"Monday to Friday they have the menu which includes Starters, Burgers/Second menu, 1Drink and 1 dessert for the cost of 10‚Ç¨. Menu is a good choice to take. It is quite complete and you makes you full. Would recommend this place if you have an hour for lunch."
ChIJQ9W9my8mQg0RMdnDYolP8I0,2,Food was good. Service was slow. Way overpriced. Kid that barely ate anything charged full price
ChIJQ9W9my8mQg0RMdnDYolP8I0,4,"Central hotel in a very good location in Madrid, next to Atocha. Comfortable rooms and professional staff. Very good breakfast with variety of high quality options. Remarkable in this sense. Maybe it needs some renovation of some rooms and gym room."
ChIJQ9W9my8mQg0RMdnDYolP8I0,5,"I pass by very frequently for work and it is one of the best I have found in variety, quality and service. I usually only have breakfast and I repeat that it is the best I have found and there are many hotels that I have been able to visit over the last few years. ü´∂"
ChIJQ9W9my8mQg0RMdnDYolP8I0,4,Elegant. Fine. Simple.

ChIJHYpGYy8mQg0RJQ14rUCTWY8,5,"This is a small unassuming bar.  What surprised me was how clean it was when I first entered to other bars on the same street.

We had  menu del d√≠a for 11 euros per person on a public holiday.  Everything was great good portions, good variety of starters, main dish and dessert.

Service was a little slow, but they were quite busy.  I would recommended and will repeat!"
ChIJHYpGYy8mQg0RJQ14rUCTWY8,5,"Really liked this place. Quality menu del dia, with one of my favorites as a first-course option - pimientos rellenos con bacalao. Very tasty. Also really liked the sea bass 2nd course. I skipped dessert, but the ones going to the tables around me looked great. Fast friendly service during busy lunchtime. I'll be back for sure!"
ChIJHYpGYy8mQg0RJQ14rUCTWY8,3,"Cider is yes, but... NO"
ChIJHYpGYy8mQg0RJQ14rUCTWY8,4,"Paramos un domingo al mediod√≠a, ya bastante tarde, para comer algo antes de pillar un tren en Atocha. En ese momento s√≥lo ten√≠an bocadillos, porque estaban medio cerrando la cocina, as√≠ que les agradecimos mucho que nos atendieran con esa amabilidad. Pedimos uno de lomo con queso y otro de pollo con salsa roquefort, buen sabor. Relaci√≥n calidad-precio m√°s que correcta."
ChIJHYpGYy8mQg0RJQ14rUCTWY8,1,"I have been scammed. The menu of the day ‚Ç¨13 has served me a pittance that not even a 4-year-old child could satisfy.

From the first dish I communicated it and they told me that it is to have space for the second... What a surprise!! It was also a pittance, little, insufficient.

Cold food.

Mashed potatoes as a side dish, from a box, not natural.

Bad service, they told me that's what it is, as if it were a gift.

I left hungry and wasted my time and money.

I suspect they may even have spit my food at me, with their bad attitude."
ChIJuzQCEi8mQg0RggFbtvJNT0A,5,"It was the best authentic Spanish meal of my trip. Had the ""plato del d√≠a"" consisting of a tasty fish soup starter that included rice, calamari mussels, and fish with bread. The main course was a grilled mackerel that was fresh and perfectly prepared. Served with a coffee and üç∑ üëå"
ChIJuzQCEi8mQg0RggFbtvJNT0A,5,"My favorite restaurant in Madrid! It was totally charming to eat a spot with local people enjoying their lunch break. The food is so fresh, simple, and tasty. As an American this restaurant was a lesson in the good life. Staff who are passionate about their food and a clientele taking a break from work to prioritize a great meal. I left inspired and very happy."
ChIJuzQCEi8mQg0RggFbtvJNT0A,5,"Small space but amazing churros with chocolate!! Too decadent to begin the morning with that but, did it anyway and it was worth it üòÄ!! And the eggs and bacon were excellent too!"
ChIJuzQCEi8mQg0RggFbtvJNT0A,5,"Really good food for fair prices, big quantities and nice service. Recommend if looking for a non turistic place to eat spanish food"
ChIJuzQCEi8mQg0RggFbtvJNT0A,5,"Great place for a quick bite. Good tostas and coffee. Not too far from the museum, less crowded."
ChIJFZp5BC8mQg0Rc3LOKqUF8Ms,4,"The food is good, inexpensive and abundant. True Colombian taste. The place itself is simple and without frills. Is good for a quick lunch or dinner. The attention is good and friendly."
ChIJFZp5BC8mQg0Rc3LOKqUF8Ms,5,"One of the most homely food experiences we've had. It felt like we went to their home, not a restaurant, and had food that they would make for their family. The food was so delicious, we couldn't stop eating until our bellies were full. We met a Colombian family who gave us their excellent recommendations. Even though we didn't understand each other's language, we communicated perfectly. The people are so nice and friendly. Also, one of the most value for money meals we've had in all of Madrid. Highly recommend visiting here for a lovely experience."
ChIJFZp5BC8mQg0Rc3LOKqUF8Ms,5,They offer a very tasty menu of the day for a good price.
ChIJFZp5BC8mQg0Rc3LOKqUF8Ms,5,"Great food, beetroot salad is delicious, flank steak is also very good."
ChIJFZp5BC8mQg0Rc3LOKqUF8Ms,5,"Everything from the food, to the service, and the atmosphere, I felt right back at home in Colombia. The food was authentic and so so good, definitely recommend the bandeja paisas. If you're looking for a restaurant with authentic colombian food in Spain, definitely recommend this place! Our server was great and one of the customers even gave us free shots. Loved it will be coming back when we're back in Madrid!"
ChIJU3qpiiUmQg0R49QIhIACTjw,3,"I can only speak of my personal experience. Food looks great, but tastes average, below expectation. I am surprised by the small portion, and the ""octopus rings"" are made of flour. Definitly feels a little overpriced."
ChIJU3qpiiUmQg0R49QIhIACTjw,5,Good bar with friendly services. I surprisingly enjoy seafood paella a lot so I return and still enjoy. Staff is friendly and attentive. Price is valuable.
ChIJU3qpiiUmQg0R49QIhIACTjw,1,"Watch out for the pickpocket! This place is NOT safe. My family had diner at this place. After the dinner, we found my wife‚Äôs purse got stolen. This ruins our whole trip. There are security camera sign on the front door, but the owner refused to show us the footages."
ChIJU3qpiiUmQg0R49QIhIACTjw,4,"Let's be honest, this is not a fancy place nor is the cusine really complex. It's a small place that sells grilled meats next to the train station. It's cheap, it's fast and it got beer. Manage your expectations if you come here but for the price the offer is good ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Nothing outstanding. The staff is nice and kind. So that's really good."
ChIJU3qpiiUmQg0R49QIhIACTjw,4,"The food was surprisingly good.   I got the pork and cheese sandwich and some bravas    Fair price, only con is that the service was pretty slow. Overall good experience for lunch."
ChIJxdIV7z0mQg0RVPzVj3h752M,2,Not real kebabs; it's shawarma chicken (sliced from a spinning roasted block). I'm guessing that the pictures on their website are old because they are not set up to make actual kebabs. Meat was pretty salty and had a flavor of roasted pork. They were friendly though.
ChIJxdIV7z0mQg0RVPzVj3h752M,4,Halal food. Various kebab set to suit your appetite (with rice/fries/bread etc). The kebab with rice set is good for sharing. The shop is small but the staff is always smiling. You'll feel welcomed.
ChIJxdIV7z0mQg0RVPzVj3h752M,5,Great place to eat kebab and other kebab menus with such reasonable price.
ChIJxdIV7z0mQg0RVPzVj3h752M,1,Bought Samosa today at 17:52 PM before train. Asked for vegetarian. Got Samosa with Chicken. Sandwich had hair. Called the place and instead of apologizing the guy was not even apologizing. We are traveling to a different city with hungry stomach since we are vegetarians.
ChIJxdIV7z0mQg0RVPzVj3h752M,1,Didn't like the place. Not very tasty and they charged me more than is advertised. The bathroom was filthy. Next time I'll look it up for other places.
ChIJOZXBFSQmQg0Roo7L9KFR0aI,2,"This place confused me. My expectations were so much higher‚Ä¶
In the beginning everything seemed fine- I loved how the restaurant was located on top floor, it also looked fancy inside and atmosphere was nice. Clean, tidy, AC, good style. Menu looked interesting as well.
Then we ordered some of most expensive things on the menu which was meat (pork) and fish (turbot). The portions were so small! I couldn‚Äôt believe I got such a tiny piece of fish covered in loads of mayonnaise sauce. My friend also got two tiny pieces of pork. To be honest, it wasn‚Äôt even tasty- very average in taste.
We paid 65 euros and left this place hungry and disappointed.

If this restaurant would be converted into a bar and then you could get away with this food issue. You seriously have to correct what‚Äôs happening in your kitchen.
The biggest disappointment of my week in Madrid."
ChIJOZXBFSQmQg0Roo7L9KFR0aI,5,"We went to the Brakery here, and was outstanding - The service and food!

The ham and cheese croissant was my dish. My partner got the ham and bri cheese. I enjoyed both with warm mint tea."
ChIJOZXBFSQmQg0Roo7L9KFR0aI,2,"Very beautiful menu and climatic place, the staff if professional and nice however language barrier was an issue. So all in all until drinks expectation was high and appetite great. But then the food came and everything was destroyed. Small portions, cold, maybe nice looking but overfancied, taste 2/10. For two microscopic pork loin pieces, consisting mostly of fat (I am still not convinced that takt was a pork loin) 22 euros. I guess this is a place where only burgers can and should be ordered. For drinks 10/10. Food 2/10."
ChIJOZXBFSQmQg0Roo7L9KFR0aI,5,"Great experience in this private terrace. We were treated cool. The best thing is the location, super handy if you come or go from Atocha to anywhere else. Food 4/5 points, I rate 5 for the service and good effort to make us feel good
Keep going team"
ChIJOZXBFSQmQg0Roo7L9KFR0aI,3,"The place is very pretty but service is so so, and food portions are little for the price. Comfortable seating, nice atmosphere (lights, music, etc). I didn't particularly enjoy the general attitude of the stuff, pretty cold, rushing and don't really making eye contact. The food taste was ok but the quantity I found a bit small.
It is a good place to go if you prioritise having a pleasant rest while on the stop over in Atocha, I would not choose it as a local."
ChIJVVD9PhcmQg0RW96Ev_pjww4,4,"This restaurant has good quality and portions, the pricing is a bit steep. The staff and service was quick and cordial, and the food was great, i would recommend another visit to try more of their menu."
ChIJVVD9PhcmQg0RW96Ev_pjww4,5,"Nice restaurant.
All menu is in Spanish.. so, google translate will help.

The portion of the food is just right. You can choose either in/outdoor."
ChIJVVD9PhcmQg0RW96Ev_pjww4,2,It is mediocre for the prices it has. The food is not very good but it is expensive. It's not too clean. It is not the best place I have found in the area. A little bit disappointed.
ChIJVVD9PhcmQg0RW96Ev_pjww4,4,"Amazingly cosmopolitan, out of the beaten track bar, it's well worth a visit if you don't mind a 5 minute ride on metro or bus from Atocha to the nearby, classy but cozy Pac√≠fico neighbourhood in search of a more tranquil setting. Food is as Spanish and international as it is tasty, and service is sure to meet up expectations."
ChIJVVD9PhcmQg0RW96Ev_pjww4,3,"Good food, but small place"
ChIJOa79OAUmQg0Rzh9Crjdi7ms,5,Very good restaurant! Friendly staff and beautiful atmosphere! The daily menu was very good value for money! Try the chicken tajin! Recommended
ChIJOa79OAUmQg0Rzh9Crjdi7ms,5,This place is a hidden gem!  We went with a Groupon offer and were blown away by how delicious everything was!  The couscous with vegetables and chicken was great but the beef tajine my husband ordered was truly spectacular.  Not to mention the mohalabia and mint tea was the perfect way to end the meal!  Our server was very attentive and we felt very welcome.  Will definitely be coming back soon!
ChIJOa79OAUmQg0Rzh9Crjdi7ms,5,"The Pakistani tea is the best tea I've ever tried, super recommended. The waitress forgot to serve it and I waited for 15 minutes, but still the place is great to chill."
ChIJOa79OAUmQg0Rzh9Crjdi7ms,5,We discovered it on Groupon and it exceeded our expectations.
ChIJOa79OAUmQg0Rzh9Crjdi7ms,5,"We had a great experience. We went for a birthday dinner with 8 people and the waiters were attentive and generous (even though we had a Groupon which often makes restaurants miserable). Thanks for looking after us so well, we‚Äôll return in the future when we‚Äôre in the area."
ChIJHTQKwxsmQg0RgaLz__xz3K0,4,Good variety of tasty and well-made tapas. Good Deal!  The service was great. We were a group of 9 without reservation however we were welcomed.  Our waiter was Super Friendly and Professional. Thumbs-up for him!
ChIJHTQKwxsmQg0RgaLz__xz3K0,1,"Complete tourist trap. Patatas bravas are the cheapest potatoes they could find at Mercadona with some hot sauce on top.
Huevos rotos con jamon also with the worst quality sliced jamon they could find.

Honestly, I'd be surprised if the beer wasn't watered down as well.

Avoid this."
ChIJHTQKwxsmQg0RgaLz__xz3K0,3,"A local bar. It ok, nothing out of the ordinary. Service is nice and quick"
ChIJHTQKwxsmQg0RgaLz__xz3K0,5,"Good food, great lunch menu"
ChIJHTQKwxsmQg0RgaLz__xz3K0,5,Expectacular
ChIJlbzB_BkmQg0RjEq6ztVrkNE,5,"Good food for a good price. We were looking for a quick bite just before going home and found this restaurant near the venue we were. Gave it a try and it did not disappoint! Even if the restaurant was full and it was busy, we were served immediately by friendly and professional staff. The portions served are big, and the quality is good, definitely a great price to quality ratio."
ChIJlbzB_BkmQg0RjEq6ztVrkNE,5,"We came during peak hours without reservation but they managed to seat us with a little wait
The food was very delicious. We shared a 2person platter for 3 with a starter and it was enough for all of us.
The waiters for some reason were all not very excited to serve us. They weren't mean or anything, most likely just stressed"
ChIJlbzB_BkmQg0RjEq6ztVrkNE,5,"Fantastic place. Food was so delicious, good portions and super friendly staff. We had a good chat and enjoyed lunch. There is menu del dia, very fair offer. And falafel was not dry, thank you üôè"
ChIJlbzB_BkmQg0RjEq6ztVrkNE,1,"They served me completely raw chicken that I didn‚Äôt notice until I‚Äôd eaten half of my wrap. They weren‚Äôt apologetic when I mentioned it to them and simply removed the plate. They then tried to still charge me for it which I couldn‚Äôt believe, and were extremely rude when I asked to have it removed from the bill. Hopefully I don‚Äôt have food poisoning in 12 hours time"
ChIJlbzB_BkmQg0RjEq6ztVrkNE,4,Great food and amazing prices. Lovely place with a vibrant vibe. Will surely come back.
ChIJ02zQsxEmQg0R5jVOoQM2-YY,3,"Found this place by accident. I was walking and it seemed appealing. At first sight, it looks like a nice little spot. I sat and ordered a tea and a soup to start (spoiler alert: the soup never came ü•≤ ) for my meal I had ordered the ‚Äúscented rice with shrimp and meat‚Äù, when my ‚Äúmeatless‚Äù rice arrived, I told the waitress that she had forgotten about my soup üòê but that at this point it was whatever since my food already came. ( no apology was made ü´§), I then told her that the rice who was suppose to have shrimp and meat is so naked that I‚Äôll be ordering a side of shrimp to accompany that meatless rice.
I ended up ordering a whole side dish because of that üòì
Taste wise, the rice and the side dish (shrimp in spicy curry sauce) was not bad. Just disappointed that it had literally 3 micro pieces of shrimps and maybe 2 micro pieces of meat."
ChIJ02zQsxEmQg0R5jVOoQM2-YY,5,"I accidently found the place. Big and spacious restaurant. You can select different varieties of Asian dishes.
I visited the place twice. The first one was trying the chinese / singaporean menu.
The pecking duck taste good, but the Singaporean noodle is not very tasty.
The japanese dishes are good..
and we will get crackers as our snack in the beginning. This would be our alternative place for our lunch/dinner."

ChIJ02zQsxEmQg0R5jVOoQM2-YY,5,Ok
ChIJ02zQsxEmQg0R5jVOoQM2-YY,4,"The place is good, clean and spacious. The reception was good as soon as we arrived, they took care of us, we ordered the food and they were quite fast, some dishes had a very good flavor, however the rice was a little tasteless, the quantities were normal. It is a restaurant to repeat, we left satisfied."
ChIJNXM2ahAmQg0RcyyF79BQ77M,4,"Excess sauce and shortage of cheese, not taking away the above that in general if the cooking and distribution of the rest of the ingredients is good compared to other Telepizzas.
Regarding the service, the attention of the person who attended us seems very good, but they only have ONE person attending, which logically delays all orders.
It's rare to get fast food places so neat from the dining room to the toilets, it was the most pleasant."
ChIJNXM2ahAmQg0RcyyF79BQ77M,5,"Simple but nice. Few times I've been,  the staff had been always nice. Prices are very reasonable."
ChIJNXM2ahAmQg0RcyyF79BQ77M,5,Good pizza and great and polite staff
ChIJNXM2ahAmQg0RcyyF79BQ77M,5,"Nice, delicious and cheap place"

ChIJPbyU3RgmQg0RbSQgBVIAsqQ,3,"The place is nice, and it has very good Italian vibes, though too much accent on chief‚Äôs profile and presence is a bit negative.
The service is very top.
However the food was quite disappointing, very small portions for high price.

Margherita was so fatty and had basic supermarket pizza taste, it was a small starter like cheesy food rather than a real pizza. We also ordered some pasta(also tiny portion) and Lasagna and tasted nothing special. So overall the food doesn‚Äôt match the presentation and I could not tell that it was a true Italian food."
ChIJPbyU3RgmQg0RbSQgBVIAsqQ,5,"Very probably the best Italian restaurant in Spain.
The best Lasagne I've ever had .
All the food is cooked to perfection.
Advisable to book a table."
ChIJPbyU3RgmQg0RbSQgBVIAsqQ,5,"If you‚Äôre looking for the finest truffle dishes in Spain, Andrea Tumbarello is a name you need to know.

ChIJPbyU3RgmQg0RbSQgBVIAsqQ,3,Black truffle paste is not delicious. It's like eating rubber bands.. but good service!
ChIJPbyU3RgmQg0RbSQgBVIAsqQ,5,"Never did I know that one of the best Italian Restaurants is just around the corner. After reading multiple reviews, booked a table in advance with a few clients for lunch. We were late, so called in to ensure that the table is still reserved. The staff was very understanding. They have valet parking which makes it really a life saver. The menu is one word - extensive. It took me 15 min to decide what to eat. The staff helped us out in deciding. An even more extensive selection of wines. The food came quick and was of fantastic quality and presentation. A sumptuous, rustic and authentic Italian food experience. Must visit. Infact I was a repeat visitor the very next day with more clients."
ChIJOa79OAUmQg0RgWxGzh4jeGc,5,"We craved for Indian food and found the place. The food is so nice, the portion is generous, price is average.

Nice place and ambience too. The service is quick. Good information by the staff saying that they will open until 4.30. Still have time for us

Definitely will come back!"
ChIJOa79OAUmQg0RgWxGzh4jeGc,5,"Amazing experience!! The best butter chicken I‚Äôve had in my life. Everything was delicious and the waiter, Emu was the nicest and really took care of us. For the high quality taste, the price is super good. I look forward to going back many times!! 10/10 would recommend."
ChIJOa79OAUmQg0RgWxGzh4jeGc,5,Very friendly staff and great customer service. The food is fresh and tasty.
ChIJOa79OAUmQg0RgWxGzh4jeGc,4,"This place turned out to be our saviour during our Europe tour.
We got the food that appealed to our taste buds.. freshly made and very tasty. As it was close to the hotel we were staying, it became our dinner haunt during all the days we were in Madrid.
The staff was polite, obliging and courteous and accommodated all our requests. We carry home good memories of this wonderful hotel..
Worth every penny spent here.."
ChIJOa79OAUmQg0RgWxGzh4jeGc,5,"Very welcoming restaurant. The food is very good, abundant and mildly spiced (I suggest you ask to spice it up if you so wish).
The waiter was very friendly, which helped feeling cozy.
I have noticed they do many deliveries, and they didn't let the riders wait for long, so the delivery service must be good as well."
ChIJq121zxkmQg0Ryzuor-rRMpg,5,"Really nice food, and although I am not Polish I have been told that is the ""real thing"". Soups are delicious (Red borscht with dumplings and ≈ªurek), and filling. We also ordered Dumplings mix,, Seasoned minced meat (go≈ÇƒÖbki)wrapped in cabbage leaves and Sausage accompanied by fried onion (polska kie≈Çbasa)
All 3 cakes we asked for dessert also amazing: Cheesecake, Apple pie with a big thick filling of apple and Poppy seed cake
a really surprising discovery.
Service was always very nice and charm and the timing of the servings was perfect"
ChIJq121zxkmQg0Ryzuor-rRMpg,5,"Amazing, authentic Polish food and pleasant atmosphere. The staff speak Spanish and Polish so it's easy to communicate and they are very friendly and helpful."
ChIJq121zxkmQg0Ryzuor-rRMpg,4,"I ordered the ‚Äòmenu of the day‚Äô and had the ‚Äòensaladilla, Kielbasa sausage, and apple pie.‚Äô Everything was delicious, and the best part is that it includes a beer. I paid ‚Ç¨11.50. The only downside was that the waiter got upset because we ordered one menu and shared it. She literally slammed each dish on the table. I have no idea if that‚Äôs normal in Poland. Other than that, everything was incredible."
ChIJq121zxkmQg0Ryzuor-rRMpg,5,Had the pleasure of eating here when in Madrid. Amazing polish food for an affordable price. Highly recommended!
ChIJq121zxkmQg0Ryzuor-rRMpg,5,"Best food I had in a week of travel thru Spain. Wholesome no fuss, home cooked meals at super reasonable prices. Oh, and the polish beer...so much better!"
ChIJhf7eBBImQg0RFEoPxOP6XGY,5,"Staff was so accommodating and friendly. After being pickpocketed and feeling so down, this place really cheered me up! Thank you! Drinks and food all very good!"
ChIJhf7eBBImQg0RFEoPxOP6XGY,5,What a wonderful restaurant! My group of five visited from TX and we received the best service and the best food. They were patient as we ordered and everything was delicious. I would visit again in a heartbeat! Thank you for such a great experience.
ChIJhf7eBBImQg0RFEoPxOP6XGY,5,"Dropped in hungry after a long journey from England and wandered ten minutes from my hotel. Super little neighbourhood bar with excellent food. In no way aimed at tourists but very welcoming and friendly - good affordable wine - chopitos were decent, croquetas house made and top quality, patatas mixtas (half each bravas and allioli) spot on and a huge portion. Extras non-charged of boquerones and a really good tomato and onion salad were a welcome surprise. Cracking coffee. Awesome service. You‚Äôll need to speak some Spanish but then you should, shouldn‚Äôt you."
ChIJhf7eBBImQg0RFEoPxOP6XGY,5,"Superb quality and portion of food! good environment, reasonable price, and the people are super friendly, some of them speak English as well. Highly recommended!"
ChIJhf7eBBImQg0RFEoPxOP6XGY,5,"Excellent family restaurant, great food a d prices.  No English, but Google Translate and nice waiter made it work perfectly.  56 euros for steak/fries, ham/potatoe/cheese balls, 4 beers, 3 wine, and 4 free tapas.   Awesome!!!"
ChIJ9VgLPxcmQg0RYnk--jdKnXo,5,"Service is very straightforward and easy. the pizza is delicious and i go to this restaurant almost every week. i always order the thick crust, and the image is the normal crust. i  love this restaurant and i am going to eat here today"
ChIJ9VgLPxcmQg0RYnk--jdKnXo,3,"Yummy ""pizza"" and cheap if you get the offer to eat and drink how much you want (minimum 2 people, I think). The only things are: in the beginning, we had to sit outside, in the cold, because it was full inside (only three tables are inside, and they were take); there is a cringe video about a certain ""Silvia Serrano"", who seems to be the director of marketing, and whose mouth is moved in an unnatural way. Also, half the video is dedicated to people that yell ""¬°Gracias, Silvia!"" for ""making it possible"" to deliver medium pizzas for the price of 9.99 euros, as if she did something out of the ordinary. I think it's just her big ego."
ChIJ9VgLPxcmQg0RYnk--jdKnXo,1,"Bad customer service.

They rushed my order because there were a lot of people in line. Thus, making a mistake with my order. I also did not like how the people working in the cash register treated their customers. If you work in the service sector, AT LEAST try to give good service. It is better to eat somewhere else."
ChIJ9VgLPxcmQg0RYnk--jdKnXo,4,"The pizza was good, except for the fact that under it was something that i didn't recognize (and hope that it didn't be a beacon since I'm a vegetarian).
But i would mention Luis that gave a great service!"
ChIJ9VgLPxcmQg0RYnk--jdKnXo,4,Gets busy on Sunday's after everything shut downs (stores and Chinese shops) only had to wait about 7 mins for to go pizza after ordering. Hard working staff and all around great atmosphere! üòä
ChIJrQAqNhcmQg0RcHGvroNApdc,4,"Wow, the food here is incredible. The toast of gambas and the mussels were excellent. The staff were friendly and service quick and up to par. I would definitely visit this place for tasting more of their food and drinks."
ChIJrQAqNhcmQg0RcHGvroNApdc,3,"Really good food for the price. Abundant and tasty. I give only three stars for the service. Waiters seemed to be annoyed by us, when we ask for bread, almost had to beg, the guy make a funny comment. Otherwise place and food is a great location and, almost, a hidden gem."
ChIJrQAqNhcmQg0RcHGvroNApdc,4,"Nice, friendly, good food, a little on the pricy side for what it is, but ok. Not 5 stars for the beer selection (sorry to but I am too much Madrelenio ü§¶üèº)"
ChIJrQAqNhcmQg0RcHGvroNApdc,1,Came on a Saturday and for tapas the 3 of us each ordered a drink but were only served a small portion of chips and it was served with hair
ChIJrQAqNhcmQg0RcHGvroNApdc,3,3.5 stars
ChIJaQFjWxAmQg0RWZjphRwnO3c,4,"Nice and cozy bakery/cafe. Always curious to try as it is always busy.

Good staff as she offered me to buy extra croissant to get their special price (buy 3 at ‚Ç¨2.10) to take away."
ChIJaQFjWxAmQg0RWZjphRwnO3c,5,"Ever since they have renovated the place, it has transformed. Earlier it was dingy with low light and not very clean. Now with the new decor, open setting, it is a great place to have a coffee or have breakfast. The staff are cordial and very friendly. They have excellent Croissants. Overall good place to chill have a coffee and snack"
ChIJaQFjWxAmQg0RWZjphRwnO3c,3,"There is no soap in the toilet, the floor is messy. The cappuccino taste is so-so, and the saucer is in bad condition, see photo. By the way, there‚Äôs no flat white here."
ChIJaQFjWxAmQg0RWZjphRwnO3c,5,"Popped in a couple of times over last fortnight for a tostada and coffee. Good fast service both times, one of the girls redid my wife's tostada as she felt that it had been slightly overdone. üëè
Yes it's a chain but no complaints at all here!"
ChIJaQFjWxAmQg0RWZjphRwnO3c,4,"Excellent service, the girls who serve are very nice, and excellent coffee with milk; They have vegetable drinks, and the pastries are very good, very fresh, keep in mind that they do not have gluten-free or vegan products. Excellent prices to go for breakfast or a snack on the way, highly recommended"
ChIJUUKEGA4mQg0Rep6NnGDHfKg,1,"Very VERY rude staff!!! Never coming back ever, there are tons of better KEBABS out here in Madrid! This one IS A NO!!"
ChIJUUKEGA4mQg0Rep6NnGDHfKg,1,"Very Expensive & No taste at all, they don't know too make Falefal....."
ChIJUUKEGA4mQg0Rep6NnGDHfKg,5,Amazing service! Will come here all the time.
ChIJUUKEGA4mQg0Rep6NnGDHfKg,1,"The treatment with the man who is there in the morning is unfortunate, he did not let us sit with the dogs on the terrace, saying that if clients saw dogs they would not sit when the terrace was empty and inside.
After a while we get up and leave and we see that a couple comes and sits with another dog and they let them, so we decide to go in and ask for a complaint form and to this they claim that they do not have a complaint form, when is it mandatory to have them and give them if the client asks you.
He started to get cocky and say that we should call the police because the police weren't going to do anything to him, and that's what happened because we were cocky and we called the police and he left hot.
Let's see if we learn to treat customers better, who are the ones who keep the business and leave their money.
On the other hand, the boss and the other guy who is there are wonderful and charming, they always treat us very well and we get along very well with them!"
ChIJUUKEGA4mQg0Rep6NnGDHfKg,1,"I have ordered several times and the food has made me feel bad twice, I don't know what it is about it, but I have tried many kebabs and nothing has ever happened to me while eating. The place itself is small so I have almost always ordered takeout with colleagues at work. The price is cheap and the service is good, although as I have already said I don't think the food is of high quality."
ChIJa2rLGQ4mQg0RM_frVBR52Js,5,"Delicious sushi. Fresh and high quality. Delivery is very fast too and the woman at the counter is friendly.

Best sushi takeaway I have had so far and I will continue to order from here."
ChIJa2rLGQ4mQg0RM_frVBR52Js,5,The food is fresh which is very important for me especially that it's sushi and noodles.
ChIJa2rLGQ4mQg0RM_frVBR52Js,5,"I ordered sushi and miso soup and I must say I really like that their portions are a bit bigger than in other places. They make it very fast and fresh.
I will definitely order from them again."
ChIJa2rLGQ4mQg0RM_frVBR52Js,1,"The Pad Thai we just ordered is a shame, it's basically noddles as you can see. It has nothing to do with a real one."
ChIJa2rLGQ4mQg0RM_frVBR52Js,5,Always delicious. I order at least once a week!
ChIJ398NZRomQg0R4Yp3ZfEPYUs,5,"Delicious breads! And on top of that, I received these muffins as a gift. Highly recommended!"
ChIJ398NZRomQg0R4Yp3ZfEPYUs,5,"A marvel! It's the main thing that comes to mind when thinking about the rosc√≥n de Reyes that I bought today at Celikatessen. I really appreciate artisanal, conscious and ""honest"" preparation (without adding poop of all kinds, which is what industrial pastries do) and that is what I have found in Celikatessen.  If I eat a sweet, I love that it is of good quality and natural products. And that's how the rosc√≥n was, spongy, soft, sweet but not too sweet (big plus) - if you don't know it's gluten-free, you won't even notice.  I'll be back soon!!!"
ChIJ398NZRomQg0R4Yp3ZfEPYUs,5,"Very happy! The IVADI doctor recommended it to me because I have to follow a gluten-free diet and I have to say that I have never tried such good gluten-free bread!! I'm also from Valencia, I placed the order on Tuesday and it arrived on Thursday (today). Exquisite! I am going to be a regular customer in ordering it at home."
ChIJ398NZRomQg0R4Yp3ZfEPYUs,5,"After years of searching and regularly buying bread here, I can say with certainty that it is the best gluten-free bread maker in Madrid. The breads are delicious. The treatment is great and they give you great advice. I order the bread via WhatsApp in the morning and they keep it for me until I can go buy it."
ChIJ398NZRomQg0R4Yp3ZfEPYUs,5,"The products they make are impressive!!! All ecological, and with impressive quality! Very very top and healthy! Their creations leave no one indifferent! They make gluten-free breads juicy and very tasty! Many formats and options. Shipping is efficient and arrives in perfect condition! On the other hand, the treatment is also excellent!"
ChIJB2QgPBomQg0Rl1fZH7MLT-8,5,I was actually very impressed with some of the meals from Laurel Natural. They were all very filling and full of flavor. I would definitely consider ordering from this brand again.  They have so many  options in their various menus that I would like to try next time.
ChIJB2QgPBomQg0Rl1fZH7MLT-8,4,"Good variety of dishes at reasonable prices nice staff
recommended"
ChIJB2QgPBomQg0Rl1fZH7MLT-8,5,"I have always gone with my mother and although sometimes the treatment was not the best I have to say that the last time things have changed. The new girl treated us wonderfully, always with a smile and reminded us of the old-fashioned business treatment that existed before. As for the food, it is homemade food, and although it is true that the quality has gone down a bit and there are things that can be seen to have been made from one day or another, they are very good if you catch them recently. To get you out of a hurry and a day without the desire to cook, this place is the one."
ChIJB2QgPBomQg0Rl1fZH7MLT-8,5,"Take-home food site. The food is pretty good and the best thing is not very expensive. The menus are the best, they save you from making food and it is even cheaper than making your own food at home, at least more restful. I highlight the good work of Raquel. Everything very good. who has been there for quite some time and his kindness.
I also say the new people who are coming in because of Almendra."
ChIJB2QgPBomQg0Rl1fZH7MLT-8,1,"The portions are scarcer, they have raised the price and lowered the quality and quantity, they sell you food of worse quality than before... they give you less quantity... But they charge you more than before. If you raise the price, maintain quality and quantity, if not... Why do you raise it?

They raise the price by reducing the quantity and lowering the quality, there are more very good places nearby. In addition, the people who serve you seem to be often in a bad mood, they are usually very rude and a menu if you don't eat half a loaf of bread with the tea between your chest and back, you are left hungry just enough to get you out of trouble quickly, Royo Burguer, but at the same time Spanish and without being able to eat it there üòÇüòÇ"
ChIJPQ33CBAmQg0Rlct4nxebQxA,5,Delicious food! That fresh warm bread they served was amazing! Very friendly service. Love it!
ChIJPQ33CBAmQg0Rlct4nxebQxA,2,"Really RUDE and unprofessional who works here as a waitress , she doesn‚Äôt respect any customer with no education way to talk at all !!
Really shame because taste was actually good but waitress was really useless !!!"
ChIJPQ33CBAmQg0Rlct4nxebQxA,3,"I have been here a few times and every time the service is not as good as the previous visit.

The waitress is usually alone and there are a lot of tables to serve. Last time I went, which was yesterday, I waited around 35-40 minutes for a ""pitufo de tortilla"". The food was good and hot, but once the waitress brought the food they forgot the sauce and took them 10 minutes to bring it to the table.

I would not suggest you come here if you see it crowded and I would also recommend leaving if you wait longer than expected."
ChIJPQ33CBAmQg0Rlct4nxebQxA,4,"This place serves delicious molletes, a soft white bread combined with olive oil, plus a variety of toppings like jam√≥n serrano. It is a traditional breakfast from Southern Spain, but tasty enough to be offered and enjoyed throughout the day. La Antikaria's menu has expanded over the years. In my last visit, I really liked the Porra Antequerana, a thick, cold tomato soup."
ChIJPQ33CBAmQg0Rlct4nxebQxA,5,I got there by chance.... I just loved everything. Definitely going back.
ChIJV1VcpxkmQg0RtZiuo16eIBQ,5,"Excellent sushi, fast service and good quality fresh fish"
ChIJV1VcpxkmQg0RtZiuo16eIBQ,5,"Very nice authentic Japanese restaurant. The takoyaki is amazing, we ordered 2 portions.
The miso soup tastes very authentic. Definitely will comeback"
ChIJV1VcpxkmQg0RtZiuo16eIBQ,5,Nice and warm place to try sushi and ramen. Good service.
ChIJV1VcpxkmQg0RtZiuo16eIBQ,5,Excellent place to get a great sushi at a very reasonable price. Everything was tasty.
ChIJV1VcpxkmQg0RtZiuo16eIBQ,4,"It was really tasty!! They are not Japanese but still sushi was good performance!!!
Great price and loved it!!
Highly recommended !!!"
ChIJnQYcWRomQg0RVKjyLKsgyY0,5,Tasty food and friendly service at this local no frills tapas bar. Serves good bocadillo de calamares if you want one off the beaten track. Lovely vermouth too.
ChIJnQYcWRomQg0RVKjyLKsgyY0,5,"Awesome place for raciones, off the beaten path. The pigs ear was delicious as were the patatas bravas. The owner is friendly and funny, and the price is very reasonable."
ChIJnQYcWRomQg0RVKjyLKsgyY0,5,"üíØ The best bar in Madrid, few places like this place remain. Serious and kind people. Each one with its touch of spices. Quiet and pleasant place. Where you can have a good time, whether you want to have a quick coffee or eat some warm meatballs. Both families and individuals. We are all well received and we always leave grateful. üí´"
ChIJnQYcWRomQg0RVKjyLKsgyY0,5,"Excellent service and excellent appetizers. The coldest bottles in Madrid!! We will return without a doubt. A good place, very familiar and pleasant. Great broken eggs with ham!!"
ChIJnQYcWRomQg0RVKjyLKsgyY0,5,"Friendliness, good service, not delicious food, the next thing, a bar from the old days, the same as always.
And if you have to go from the other side of Madrid to get a potato omelette that you had expressly ordered, you just go and that's it.
With this I say it all ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJI_-LexkmQg0R0sCfYBJrQUU,5,The food was very delicious and the service was great. I will visit often in the future.
ChIJI_-LexkmQg0R0sCfYBJrQUU,5,"Very cozy place. Portions were big and tasty... the tacos al pastor are one of the best, if not the best, that I have tried in Madrid so far!"
ChIJI_-LexkmQg0R0sCfYBJrQUU,3,"The food is not bad, but if you‚Äôre Mexican and expect to have an authentic experience, this is not the place. The flautas are baked (they‚Äôre supposed to be fried) and they don‚Äôt bring salsa with the tacos.
The Sopa Azteca was ok."
ChIJI_-LexkmQg0R0sCfYBJrQUU,5,Such a great restaurant with wonderful decor and great Mexican/Latin music! We had amazing margaritas and horchata along with perfect enchiladas and burritos. Definitely a must try if you're in the area.
ChIJI_-LexkmQg0R0sCfYBJrQUU,5,"It's a nice small place that transports you to any small town in Mexico. The food is juicy and tasty, served in good proportions. The staff is welcoming and attentive. It was a very good dinner and I'll probably return many more times. Gracias!"
ChIJ8ULOzhsmQg0R1uQeP_vwJZc,3,"The pigeons made a great story for the years to come. There is a lot of food for the money. Had good flavor, but was a bit dry. The owner was very friendly and helpful. So many options in town I'm not sure if we would return."
ChIJ8ULOzhsmQg0R1uQeP_vwJZc,5,"This is, in my opinion, the best kebab in Madrid. The food here is very good."
ChIJ8ULOzhsmQg0R1uQeP_vwJZc,5,Best kebab we have had yet! Not many people in there but there should be!
ChIJ8ULOzhsmQg0R1uQeP_vwJZc,5,Best Kebab in all of Europe. Kebab Madrid is the spot.
ChIJ8ULOzhsmQg0R1uQeP_vwJZc,5,I am happy to go there all are good
ChIJUySfaxkmQg0RYgyj6iw7IiY,5,"Excellent service, best octopus!! Awesome desert. A must if you are in Madrid"
ChIJUySfaxkmQg0RYgyj6iw7IiY,4,"there were amazing foods we could experienced!they didnt speak english,so usual costmer helped us.
sometimes the price was wrong and even if we oder one size,but they surved 2 person's size and price was double.
but not so expensive and we enjoyed a lotÔºÅ
very great restaurantÔºÅ"
ChIJUySfaxkmQg0RYgyj6iw7IiY,5,Great galician restaurant. Excellent service. We tried Pulpo pasion and antricot to share. They were both delicious
ChIJUySfaxkmQg0RYgyj6iw7IiY,5,"Very good! We stopped by after a walk through Ritero Park, just before siesta time. We were a bit dissuaded at first by the old look of the restaurant, but it actually turned out to be a diamond in the rough.
We had the baked octopus and grilled turkey from the standard menu, both very good. The turkey came with fries and garlic sauce. The octopus came with baked potatoes and a few Saint Jacques scallops, all in a sizzling dish. The octopus tentacle was notably larger than any I've ever seen, and it caught our eyes from the moment we entered the restaurant.
We also found a very good daily menu, one of the things I really like about Spanish restaurants. Out of the few options they offered, we had the salmorejo cordobesa (cold cream tomato soup with jamon) and the ragout de ternera (veal stew) which were honestly fantastic. Both were full of flavour, and the veal was so soft, it simply melted in your mouth. These two, together with the olives and bread, came down to ‚Ç¨18, which I think is great value for money.
After the good mains, we wanted to try the desserts as well. They didn't have a dessert menu, so our waiter tried to explain to us what they had. He didn't speak English, and our Spanish was not good enough to understand, so he brought out the two options they had. The first was a cheesecake, but we went for the other, a tart, which I think was called Saint Germain. It was very nice and soft, with a bit of walnuts and powder sugar sprinkled on top. It was complemented well by the coffee liquor we received on the house.
For drinks, we had vermouth and sangria. We were expecting a glass of wine with sangria, but it came in a 400ml beer stein, so bonus points. It was also the first time we had sangria made with vermouth and brandy, but it sure tasted good.
The service was very good. Our waiter was an older gentleman, very experienced and kind. He didn't speak English but understood a little bit of what we were trying to say. They had an English menu, so that helped a bit. A final mention, I appreciated the fact there was no music. My ears needed a break from the noisy city.
Honestly, this was such a great find. The atmosphere was nice, the food very good and the price much better than other restaurants closer to the city centre."
ChIJUySfaxkmQg0RYgyj6iw7IiY,4,"Very good food, very Good service ! I'll go back"
ChIJPwzKFhsmQg0Rfwt1bEnoZnw,1,"Officially the worst Burger King that i have been to ever. The first time that i had burnt meat, dry as desert and for the price for almost 9 Euro, what a waste of noney for double steakhouse, im really a Fan of Burger King but this one was so incredibly horrible, such a huge disappointment... Man

Edit: there was also no costumers at all and it took them sooo long.

This Burger King is a Joke please go to other one or just eat something else."
ChIJPwzKFhsmQg0Rfwt1bEnoZnw,5,Good service and great store set up. Staff are friendly and the place is kept very clean. The meals are well put together and presented.
ChIJPwzKFhsmQg0Rfwt1bEnoZnw,5,Stephany was so lovely & so such good service. Such a friendly face. So welcoming
ChIJPwzKFhsmQg0Rfwt1bEnoZnw,5,"It's a Burger King ! Clean, decent staff."
ChIJPwzKFhsmQg0Rfwt1bEnoZnw,5,"Nice burger King, It has been recently refurbished, and it's very nice looking, service is good."
ChIJyw3AIwwmQg0R-mnrYm-ClMU,5,This is a really good Maccies! The food was always hot and prepared really quick.
ChIJyw3AIwwmQg0R-mnrYm-ClMU,4,Nice clean McDonald branch. They even have gluten free beer!
ChIJyw3AIwwmQg0R-mnrYm-ClMU,5,"Was very clean, food was delicious, fresh hot and fast. Staff was very friendly and polite."
ChIJyw3AIwwmQg0R-mnrYm-ClMU,4,"Really good service on counter. Sales machine really easy to use. Every area of the restaurant is clean, good Wi-Fi signal, coffee the best, dessert really good. Need to say that MCDonald Spain it's fabulous."
ChIJyw3AIwwmQg0R-mnrYm-ClMU,5,"Very nice and clean Resturant,  service was excellent and with a smile, quality if food is the same as any MD around the world."
ChIJW2XKvhsmQg0RTaeKpbtXcDw,5,"The croquetas de¬†carabineros are the BEST croquetas I've tried so far - good texture and super flavourful! We were sooo surprised how croquetas can be this good!
The service was excellent too! The gentleman that served us was friendly and attentive and we had a lovely chat before leaving. Will come back to try more dishes next time in the city. Highly recommended if you're in the neighbourhood!"
ChIJW2XKvhsmQg0RTaeKpbtXcDw,5,"Absolutely delicious food! Not a touristy spot, do not expect English! Staff was very patient though, and very kind.

Chicken sandwich was amazing, hamburger has generous patty size. Highly recommend the chorizo plate."
ChIJW2XKvhsmQg0RTaeKpbtXcDw,2,"Ordered the menu of the day-- asparagus and crochets and fries. I couldn't eat the appetizer after tasting it. The asparagus were terribly overcooked. They fell apart when I tried to cut them and the fibers were not cut easily. The crochets were  good. The were made of potato, cheese, and ham. The flan had good flavor."
ChIJW2XKvhsmQg0RTaeKpbtXcDw,5,"This is one of the best places to eat in Madrid, great food, excellent service!
The menu is a 2 course meal and includes desert, just fantastic!
Amazing quality and flavors!
Highly recommended!
Las croquetas, the Spanish tortilla de patatas!
Albondigas, all dishes are amazing!"
ChIJW2XKvhsmQg0RTaeKpbtXcDw,5,"Nice food, reasonable price, pleasant staff. Excellent experience"
ChIJ0Zk1UxAmQg0RD5a5F1CPRnU,4,"We came out of the way as wanted to taste a good paella. Google review showed this place as it‚Äôs a rice restaurant.

English is very limited here so make sure you speak Spanish or use your translation app. Menu was confusing as it said price per person without a remark saying if there‚Äôs a minimum person. We wanted to taste 2 paella dishes but was told minimum is for 2 people. We ordered the pealed seafood and ham paella. ü•ò

The paella came looking good. But we noticed that some of the rice wasn‚Äôt well cooked yet. And the rice was more wet than we hoped for.

The grilled octopus was fair.

A note. They will charge for the cracker and butter appetizer so I think you can reject it when they bring it to your table. We thought it was complimentary and started eating it to later find on the bill it was charged."
ChIJ0Zk1UxAmQg0RD5a5F1CPRnU,4,"I loved the pulpo a lagallega , I recommend it!
We also tried the black paella, arroz negro con chiproi, but I didn't like it much, the rice was undercooked.
But the service was great üëç"
ChIJ0Zk1UxAmQg0RD5a5F1CPRnU,5,"EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!!!!!!
I am a big seafood lover, and the alioli and onion pair so good with bread, it‚Äôs just simply beautiful ü§§"
ChIJ0Zk1UxAmQg0RD5a5F1CPRnU,5,The arroz caldoso was excellent! We were attended to very well by the waiter and also gave us good recommendations. A must try! The place is near the Pacifico Metro Station.
ChIJ0Zk1UxAmQg0RD5a5F1CPRnU,3,"Well, to be honest, not good customer service, and my first dish was cold."
ChIJWyBPOhomQg0RvDmOSrDVi9Y,4,"This restaurant serves traditional food and the locality in its fish was exemplary. The tuna, anchovies, and the calamari were top class tier in taste and presentation. It is definitely worth the price of admission to revisit again and again."
ChIJWyBPOhomQg0RvDmOSrDVi9Y,5,"Small bar/restaurant. Enjoyed our lunch, the meatballs in particular were very good."
ChIJWyBPOhomQg0RvDmOSrDVi9Y,5,No frills local place. Would love to just spend the whole day here if I had the time! They have a good lunch special as well.
ChIJWyBPOhomQg0RvDmOSrDVi9Y,5,"Nice and cosy place, salmon with Roquefort cheese is great üëå"
ChIJWyBPOhomQg0RvDmOSrDVi9Y,3,"I have had other food in this place that was ok, but the breakfast is a no-go. The bread was really bad and burnt. The tortilla was decent. We had to order it because the pan tostada was really not the best.

Cute atmosphere though and friendly staff. We liked sitting outside."
ChIJ3ZcM9RcmQg0Rfj2Gagnuu-8,5,"Great venue, very clean and good atmosphere. The food was really nice and very big portions.
Team was friendly and professional."
ChIJ3ZcM9RcmQg0Rfj2Gagnuu-8,3,Service was awful. Ordered two glasses of wine and they came up with an expensive bottle. Ordered one meal and they came with two. No questions about coffee desert etc. Just throw bill on table and took off.
ChIJ3ZcM9RcmQg0Rfj2Gagnuu-8,5,"This place hit the spot when it came to Chinese food , I will definitely come here again"
ChIJ3ZcM9RcmQg0Rfj2Gagnuu-8,4,Nice chinese restaurant with big portions. However some of the dishes weren't as I expected. Good service and good value for price.
ChIJ3ZcM9RcmQg0Rfj2Gagnuu-8,3,"Decent food and nice setting but very small portions and not very authentic - very surprised to see there was no Chinese menu in a Chinese restaurant, and when asked what kind of tea was on offer, the Chinese waitress replied ""Chinese tea"" - really not a good sign !! More a place for westerners not familiar with authentic Chinese food"
ChIJTRRbfg4mQg0RLvmNO1QMgTc,5,"Mari Angeles and her team are very kind and do their best in this busy cafe! Though it is a chain cafe, they know all their neighborhood regulars. Their breakfast deal is a good one - I especially enjoy their smoked salmon toast. Co-working is clearly posted in the window as welcome,  and they don‚Äôt mind that you work as long as you are a conciencious guest."
ChIJTRRbfg4mQg0RLvmNO1QMgTc,1,"They were so rude, even when we really asked for cutlery they would throw it at you if they weren't ashamed. You should never go, I understood why it was rated so low when I experienced it myself."
ChIJTRRbfg4mQg0RLvmNO1QMgTc,5,Great warmed ham and cheese pastry with a bit of oregano on top. Super tasty!  Cappuccino was yummy too! Not crowded. Quick service even with my poor Spanish skills
ChIJTRRbfg4mQg0RLvmNO1QMgTc,1,Very slow and under staff. The old lady is extremely rude to non English speakers and would keep you waiting while take long orders from Spanish speaking customers. Waited in here for 25 min so the English speaking worker is free to take my order.
ChIJTRRbfg4mQg0RLvmNO1QMgTc,5,"Very quick and friendly service. Baked goods are excellent, price is average, i paid ‚Ç¨2.60 for a coffee and a chocolate croissant. Service does not speak english, but pointing works."
ChIJJ1IIYzwmQg0Ra7lvkQidyZk,4,"Been visiting Gino's for many years now. I like their dedication to improving the menu, with many new dishes added since. They allow for customizations to their menu dishes. It's a comfort Italian restaurant with great service and an ambient seating area."
ChIJJ1IIYzwmQg0Ra7lvkQidyZk,5,"The food was pretty good.

The service was excellent, the waiter was very kind and polite.

Even though we got there 30 min before the closing time of the kitchen, the food was well made with great detail.

The taste was juat so right.

Thank you

100% Recommended"
ChIJJ1IIYzwmQg0Ra7lvkQidyZk,2,"Huge disappointment.
I was there for my favorite dishes, but words can not describe how bad the food is.
No disrespect for the workers, they are all so lovely.
But the noodle is so bad, the sauce is flavorless, I need to add more salt and so, the shrimps and the other seafoods are the frozen one which taste so bad. Never have I ever had this bad quality and quantity in any other Ginos.
The potatoes salad with salmon which I can only describe that it did had salmon sprinkled in it.
I was sad.
Maybe the one around in Callao is still good. If I eat it here the first time I will never go to Ginos ever again."
ChIJJ1IIYzwmQg0Ra7lvkQidyZk,2,"Overall unpleasant experience.

Waitress rather condescending to the 2 of our guests with Coeliac disease when queried on why the gluten free dishes could not be had with the set menu.

It is a valid question.   This restaurant claims to cater for those unlucky enough to be unable to eat gluten yet penalises them by charging them much more than others.   Cost them the same price for a single pasta dish when I for example had 3 courses and a beer.   This is unfair on those who effectively have a disability.
Would not go back."
ChIJJ1IIYzwmQg0Ra7lvkQidyZk,5,Cris was a wonderful waitress. Thank you for a great meal!
ChIJ2wnDPhAmQg0RWF8TuwivV8s,4,No frills traditional Spanish bar. Nice for a drink and some tapas after work
ChIJ2wnDPhAmQg0RWF8TuwivV8s,5,"If I have to sell the Spanish real way of life, someone asks me what to do to learn Spanish language fast, go there! Usual drinks and free tapas! You're love it (and it's not expensive!)"
ChIJ2wnDPhAmQg0RWF8TuwivV8s,5,Ok
ChIJ2wnDPhAmQg0RWF8TuwivV8s,5,"Delicious, abundant, good service. Everything perfect.
Assembled they measure approximately 10 cm.
Assembled of loin with cheese approximately, soft loin and cheddar cheese.
Assembled French omelette with ham.

Bravioli potatoes served on a large plate.

Everything is abundant."
ChIJ2wnDPhAmQg0RWF8TuwivV8s,5,"I don't usually give reviews, but when it's worth it, it's worth it. For these prices it is impossible to eat better, not in Madrid or anywhere else, if you ask me... not even at home. Menu: fabada and gilthead sea bream with some custard, all homemade and delicious. The beers were very well thrown and the atmosphere and incredible staff, very close. You can tell that those who stop here are real customers. If you stop by here, don't hesitate, you will eat better and cheaper than anywhere else in the area. We stopped by chance and I will repeat every time the occasion arises. a 10"
ChIJp19VRwwmQg0RyE9khKbAT5c,5,I'm quiet happy to eat in burger King because there's nany food that I like to eat there I'm satisfied.
ChIJp19VRwwmQg0RyE9khKbAT5c,2,Very pricey when you consider the quality of the burger.
ChIJp19VRwwmQg0RyE9khKbAT5c,1,"Dirty, noisy and crowdy place. Bread was disintegrating, certainly because it had been frozen. Paid the same price I would have been charged in a fancier burger place.
Overall terrible experience ..."
ChIJp19VRwwmQg0RyE9khKbAT5c,4,"Food was very good, toilets were ok.  Restaurant was very large and staff were nice."
ChIJp19VRwwmQg0RyE9khKbAT5c,4,I love burger king specially crispy chicken.In puente de vallecas is good location as it's near metro and buses
ChIJWf6xchomQg0RLGae_QkCU18,4,"This restaurant food is exquisite. The staff were friendly and quick service. The traditional spanish tortilla and chorizo was great, the portions were large and pricing was very reasonable. Definitely to visit again to try the rest of the menu."
ChIJWf6xchomQg0RLGae_QkCU18,1,The food was expensive and bad. I would not recommend this restaurant if you are a tourist: the waiters were kind but they do not speak English and they do not have a menu.
ChIJWf6xchomQg0RLGae_QkCU18,4,Good traditional Spanish food. Reasonable prices and hearty portions. Profiteroles!!
ChIJWf6xchomQg0RLGae_QkCU18,3,"The service was nice, but the food was just okay."
ChIJWf6xchomQg0RLGae_QkCU18,5,"Wow ü§Ø The best restaurant üçΩÔ∏è I've tried in Madrid so far.

Excellent menu üëçüèº and very affordable.

And the homemade food melts in your mouth... ü§§üòã

Really crazy üòô You have to try it...

Aaaah, arrive before 2:00 p.m. if you can because it fills up very quickly and it is the most popular üç¥ restaurant in the neighborhood üèòÔ∏è ü§ì"
ChIJQ-GtsBAmQg0R6NqZXyQSWsQ,4,"My wife and I stayed for one night in a neighboring hotel. We walked in the area looking for something for dinner and came across this bar accidentally. We found warm, hospitable people, good drinks and surprisingly good quality food for very reasonable prices. We left happy."
ChIJQ-GtsBAmQg0R6NqZXyQSWsQ,2,"Got caught here during a hail storm and was kind of glad that it happened. Got one drink, got one tapa. Got two drinks, got two tapas. Got three drinks, got three! Who doesn‚Äôt like food to automatically come with their beer?! It‚Äôs a petty that after trying each tapa, we kind of left it aside‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt really say the food was tasty, it was pretty sleazy as a matter of fact. But maybe we should‚Äôve known better not to expect delicacies‚Ä¶ Back to the good stuff: Simply put this place is nothing but your everyday drinking well with food to offer where neighborhood regulars go to hang out with the sweet and friendly bartenders, play in one of the available casino-machines and get punch-shwasted. ( Disclaimer: Our two star rating is not because of the quality of our experience but for the quality of the joint itself. Had a great time.)"
ChIJQ-GtsBAmQg0R6NqZXyQSWsQ,5,Best restaurant in Madrid :)
ChIJQ-GtsBAmQg0R6NqZXyQSWsQ,3,"Typical Cervecer√≠a, busy for Menu del Dia"

ChIJw1mcU8UnQg0RSCajjQ_SHsY,4,In this supermarket you will find a good wine cellar and high quality food. It not may be considered gourmet market but you find your everyday needs in superb quality. Very advisable
ChIJw1mcU8UnQg0RSCajjQ_SHsY,5,The food was amazing! The service really good! They didnt speak much English but were very lovely and helpful in helping us find vegetarian options! üëå‚ù§Ô∏è
ChIJw1mcU8UnQg0RSCajjQ_SHsY,5,Go and eat in the deli. The salmon gazpacho is incredible!! Well priced and great service
ChIJw1mcU8UnQg0RSCajjQ_SHsY,1,The shop is great...But the cafe! the toilets are absolutely filthy!
ChIJnQn_4D0mQg0R_DaYoxqY6DE,3,"The most notable thing is its fast service. It is better to go early to avoid having to queue and wait for a free seat, although given the aforementioned speed there are usually no long waits. The food varied and usually satisfactory."
ChIJnQn_4D0mQg0R_DaYoxqY6DE,2,"He puts on a grill and you have to laugh... Not a grill or anything like that...
Anyway, Repsol employees don't come to Campus to eat well, this is to get by.
Note: The Cappuccino, whenever the expert prepares it for you, is very delicious."
ChIJnQn_4D0mQg0R_DaYoxqY6DE,4,"Everything was very delicious, both breakfasts and the menu or the letter, the service was very fast and good attention from the waiters."
ChIJnQn_4D0mQg0R_DaYoxqY6DE,5,"As always, incredible attention. Great professionals with touches of humor, what we need right now. Thanks"
ChIJnQn_4D0mQg0R_DaYoxqY6DE,2,Salads sit on the counters for days. You just have to see that the plastics are full of accumulated water. The delicious sandwiches.
ChIJQ8mRIhgmQg0R7mwwlQ4xU_I,5,"Absolutely love Cruz Blanca! I've tried multiple locations, the food and ambience are perfect. Polite service. I love the Mediterranean salad, patatas bravas and croissants. Would definitely come back."
ChIJQ8mRIhgmQg0R7mwwlQ4xU_I,3,"I think it is expensive ! 5‚Ç¨ for a cup of ""cafe americano"" and a glass of orange juice"
ChIJQ8mRIhgmQg0R7mwwlQ4xU_I,5,Really friendly staff and good price range. Good for a little beer or two and for eating as well
ChIJQ8mRIhgmQg0R7mwwlQ4xU_I,1,the meat was quite literally raw red like when you see it in the shop
ChIJQ8mRIhgmQg0R7mwwlQ4xU_I,1,"20 minutes to wait for a beer in a nearly empty terrace, not the worst service I've ever sufer but close"
ChIJq0ZKkfQnQg0RPYCQPnVlN2c,5,When do you open??? We are a group that is a big fan of honest!
ChIJq0ZKkfQnQg0RPYCQPnVlN2c,5,Do you know roughly when the restaurant will open? We are looking forward to it!üòò

ChIJV8GpbjsmQg0Rd8El9_8tdOs,1,"I was walking by and saw a lot of plates with leftovers of food and dirty dishes on the tables. The restaurant was closed by the time I came by, so I guess they left it there to clean it up on the next day.
I don‚Äôt know how is the food, service or atmosphere but I guess because of the hygiene I would not eat there"
ChIJV8GpbjsmQg0Rd8El9_8tdOs,3,"Bad atmosphere, bad service, but great sweet and sour chicken."
ChIJV8GpbjsmQg0Rd8El9_8tdOs,5,Excellent food. Friendly service.
ChIJV8GpbjsmQg0Rd8El9_8tdOs,4,The price and the food are good.
ChIJV8GpbjsmQg0Rd8El9_8tdOs,5,good classic Chinese food
ChIJi148k68nQg0RiEbSTjMRBKQ,5,"Delicious. I had the vegetarian Pomodoro (there is a vegan option) - it was huge. Excellent value. The atmosphere is relaxed, staff are friendly. Well worth a visit."
ChIJi148k68nQg0RiEbSTjMRBKQ,5,"We went for dinner mostly by accident as were around and saw the place has some free tables. Just as we entered we listen to the guys by the pizza oven (real stone oven) speaking Italian between themselves, so this was either a good sign or a pretty clever marketing ploy.

We ordered two pizzas and we were greatly surprise by the taste and the quality and quantity of the ingredients, with a really good pizza bread.

Service was very efficient, courteous and helpful. Our waitress, Jennifer, deserves praise for her attitude and professionalism.

We plan to come back soon to taste the other pizzas."
ChIJi148k68nQg0RiEbSTjMRBKQ,3,"Disappointing. The servers were most likely overworked and I understand it can be stressful, but they were quite rude when talking to us. The food took over 45minutes and when it arrived the order was not correct, leaving one of the party waiting longer. My own pizza was undercooked but since I was so hungry from waiting, and with the servers being so stressed, and the order being wrong - I decided to just eat it anyway. Overpriced for such bad service and not really high quality food.

Editing just to add that even leaving was difficult. The server straight up ignored us several times as we tried to call for her. At this point, the restaurant was no longer busy and they simply ignored us while showed preference for other customers. We wanted to try the desserts but gave up on it when the servers turned their faces away from us."
ChIJi148k68nQg0RiEbSTjMRBKQ,4,"The service was not very good, but the food was excellent."
ChIJi148k68nQg0RiEbSTjMRBKQ,5,"Jaime‚Äôs service was warm and attentive. The restaurant has a hip and modern feel. The pizza was beyond delicious, authentic in every way. Everything added up to a perfect experience. 10 out of 10 would recommend."
ChIJJSRB6hkmQg0RC7at4B4Ifqw,1,"The chicken itself is good, but setting a different price if you pay by card or if you pay with cash is simply illegal and contrary to EU regulation 2015/751, and therefore reportable. Even if it is advertised on a sign and you sell it as a ""5% discount for paying in cash."" Furthermore, 5% is much higher than what entities charge for card payments, so it is also abusive."
ChIJJSRB6hkmQg0RC7at4B4Ifqw,3,"The chicken is good, very tender and juicy. Very good. However, it looks like stewed chicken, not roasted. The skin is crumbly, not crispy, and very soft. I ordered menu 1 for ‚Ç¨14 which includes 1 chicken, a portion of potatoes and croquettes. The croquettes only have dough, and the potatoes are frozen. So... for my taste it's not worth itü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èregards"
ChIJJSRB6hkmQg0RC7at4B4Ifqw,5,"In this chicken grill, and exquisite delicacies, I have begun to be very regular because of the good variety they have and their variety, apart from the more than personalized tension of their workers and owners, there is an immense variety and tastes to choose from, they serve you very well, they even advise you when choosing some type of menu. They are a very beloved family in the neighborhood and I, like many company workers nearby, help us and solve life when it comes to eating, that is, the good atmosphere, the cleanliness and the speed of I recommend their deliveries 100 √ó 100 and their exquisite dishes are worth trying. Many thanks for everything"
ChIJJSRB6hkmQg0RC7at4B4Ifqw,5,Very good roast chicken and unbeatable service.
ChIJJSRB6hkmQg0RC7at4B4Ifqw,5,"Very rich and juicy roast chicken. Great quality, price, quantity. The treatment of the staff is second to none. I will repeat without a doubt."
ChIJQyscEQgmQg0RWZ9LWBiRwKk,5,"Amazing place! This restaurant is truly a gem. Great deco, the food was authentic and delicious. The service was great. I strongly recommend this restaurantüëå"
ChIJQyscEQgmQg0RWZ9LWBiRwKk,1,"THE WORST PLACE TO EAT IN MADRID!

Today I had my worst experience in a restaurant in Madrid, we arrived with my family and the waitress initially ignored us for about 20 minutes, when she finally tried to take our order she was rude and got angry every time we asked how the food was prepared (something that is obvious because we are foreigners) from there she left and on our own we saw how they were on the internet, then she ignored us for another half hour and every time we spoke to her she pretended not to hear us, we really felt discriminated against, if there is any way to proceed legally against this place we will do it. Don't go and avoid having a bad time."
ChIJQyscEQgmQg0RWZ9LWBiRwKk,5,"Affordable, original, delicious and not crowded on a Friday night. Well worth the travel time. Have dinner here and then walk to CCVK for Madrid's best craft beer."
ChIJQyscEQgmQg0RWZ9LWBiRwKk,2,"The food it's really good in this palace. We've been twice already and the food is really good and the size of he plates really big. With two salads and 1 main dish you will have more than enough.

The problem is we have to listen Bulgarian pop music that sounds like techno, so the experience was really poor since I felt stressed the whole time. We ate everything in less than an hour. Watch that out."
ChIJQyscEQgmQg0RWZ9LWBiRwKk,3,"Food was good, although they didn‚Äôt have two of the signature Bulgarian meals: banitsa and moussaka.

The only thing that ruined my appetite was the terrible chalga music - a sufficient reason for me not to come back."
ChIJmdpFOAkmQg0RmbLbQz5my0U,5,Very good restaurant with polite and nice people. Food was excelent and big portion. I really recommend this restaurant.
ChIJmdpFOAkmQg0RmbLbQz5my0U,4,"The food is good ,the place is ok for launch"
ChIJmdpFOAkmQg0RmbLbQz5my0U,5,"This food was a highlight of the meals we ate in Madrid. It was really good. When you first enter, it looks like it's not really a sit-down restaurant and you can only ask for the things in the display case, but don't be fooled. Ask for a menu and to be seated and prepare to consume great food."
ChIJmdpFOAkmQg0RmbLbQz5my0U,5,"I was recommended this restaurant by a friend, and my experience was great. The traditional Ecuadorian food served here is absolutely delicious. Any dishes with meat are a must. Also try the milkshakes, or ""batidos"" as they're called in Spanish, because they are so creamy and delectable! If I ever return to Madrid, I will most definitely pay this place another visit."
ChIJmdpFOAkmQg0RmbLbQz5my0U,5,"Best latin place, amazing food and energy, love it! üòç"
ChIJk1V1kQkmQg0RQSUSn49YjtI,1,Fatal!

ChIJk1V1kQkmQg0RQSUSn49YjtI,4,"Bright, tidy and clean place
What is missing is that the waiters in general are attentive at all times."
ChIJk1V1kQkmQg0RQSUSn49YjtI,1,"A regrettable experience. Since we arrived, the service was terrible. They brought us the wrong order and instead of offering a solution, they wanted us to accept it and eat it! Incredible lack of respect. When we finally wanted to order the right thing, it took them forever to bring us the food, which in the end never arrived. On top of that, the prices are total abuse: ‚Ç¨3.5 for a drink, even water! The treatment by the staff was rude and disorganized. We will never return and would not recommend it to anyone."
ChIJk1V1kQkmQg0RQSUSn49YjtI,5,"Good experience, good service from the waiters and all the staff, super pleasant atmosphere. Good place to celebrate an event."
ChIJjbz9LRsmQg0Rn_Nm8DT4O4A,5,Great place to get churros con chocolate! And very good value too. Staff were also very friendly.

ChIJjbz9LRsmQg0Rn_Nm8DT4O4A,4,Real local food!No english speakng staff-small problems of communication:)
ChIJjbz9LRsmQg0Rn_Nm8DT4O4A,4,"Friendly staff, good food, and cheap lunch (I've only been for lunch)  They have their lunchtime  ""menu del dia"" clearly posted that for 7 euros you get a drink, bread, olives, entr√©e, and dessert (or coffee)."
ChIJjbz9LRsmQg0Rn_Nm8DT4O4A,5,We recieved two appetizers for our beer (for free). Very friendly staff. Recommend if you are in area :)
ChIJq7Au7wQmQg0RgQd3aISnjO8,4,"This is the perfect place to go for cheap eats ! Every Monday and Wednesday they have 1 euro tapas and they always have cheap 2‚Ç¨ beer !!!! If you are on a budget this is the place to go, but also know that the low price also means that the quality isn't the best. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try a little bit of a lot of different foods."
ChIJq7Au7wQmQg0RgQd3aISnjO8,5,Good cheap eats served quickly - popular leads to a good atmosphere üëç
ChIJq7Au7wQmQg0RgQd3aISnjO8,5,Perfect fit for a lazy afternoon with a large beer for ‚Ç¨2 and a wide variety of amazing small sandwiches from ‚Ç¨1 each.
ChIJq7Au7wQmQg0RgQd3aISnjO8,4,"Great food, great drink, awesome quality/ price but it smells like pee if you want to enjoy outside on the terrace."
ChIJq7Au7wQmQg0RgQd3aISnjO8,5,I enjoyed this restaurant just like all other restaurants of the same franchise.
ChIJKc-hWAQmQg0RpgabEy9QTHQ,3,The food in here is pretty good but the service is very slow. I have ordered churros and coffee. It took them almost 30 minutes to serve coffee and another 5 minutes to get the churros. The place wasn't that full though ! Still the food is good --> 3 stars
ChIJKc-hWAQmQg0RpgabEy9QTHQ,4,Nice stop for quick snack. Their sandwiches are full of taste üëå
ChIJKc-hWAQmQg0RpgabEy9QTHQ,2,Not great. Food just isn't that inspiring
ChIJKc-hWAQmQg0RpgabEy9QTHQ,5,Very clean environment. The toilet was spotless. Polite staff
ChIJKc-hWAQmQg0RpgabEy9QTHQ,4,Pricey for their sandwiches. A little bland for my taste.
ChIJbRL-2RomQg0RlFdfr3bUYis,4,"Wow üëè this bodega once u order you can choose a free selection of their appitizers that they feature in front of you. So for every drink, you get an appetizer. Highly recommend to revist and check their other meal options as well, great place to drink üç∏ ."

ChIJ-6QWNwQmQg0RH8GpATyuZGc,5,The food was pretty good. The lemon chicken is very delicious. They have renovated it and everything is very clean and very good. I recommend it
ChIJ-6QWNwQmQg0RH8GpATyuZGc,5,"The restaurant staff is very pleasant and good. Although it is an Asian restaurant (they serve good food) you can also go have breakfast, have your toast or sandwiches (how delicious). You can also go and have your beers with your friends who will treat you great."
ChIJ-6QWNwQmQg0RH8GpATyuZGc,5,"Good food, they are super nice, Jhon and Chin chin, I have a good time in their restaurant, I also take the food home. The painter tells you.üòâ"

ChIJbRL-2RomQg0RlvSg3sG_P5I,1,"Mouldy bread, which they didn‚Äôt bother to do anything about. Terrible old tortilla and bad coffee. The waitress did not apologise or bother to do anything about the bad quality food and mould plus charged full tourist price for a substandard breakfast.
The toilets were very dirty as well. Sadly a no go! There are any nicer places around."
ChIJbRL-2RomQg0RlvSg3sG_P5I,5,"A great place for tapas, the beers are very well drawn and the coffee is very good.

ChIJbRL-2RomQg0RlvSg3sG_P5I,5,"With each drink, a couple of tapas of _real_ food (nothing from the little bowl with olives/greasy potatoes from a bag/nuts).
Dishes and portions do not stop coming out of the kitchen.
Antonio, a thorough, exemplary professional.
Warning: small bar that fills up quickly. And with a lot of demand, logically. You're lucky if you get a spot at the bar."

ChIJR96l8agnQg0RS2VwFLvYW94,5,"Kashmir is a newly opened indian restaurant with a new management. I tried the vegetable biryani and it was good. I asked for it to be extremely spicy and it was to my satisfaction. Moreover I am vegan and very particular about going to Indian restaurants as they use ghee, butter, yogurt and milk in a lot of food which are not vegan, however Raju the owner was able to offer me some good suggestions. The prices are fair and reasonable. The food and service is way better than any of the Indian restaurants in Lavapies. If you like Indian food, definitely this is a must visit in Pacifico."

ChIJkb7myu8lQg0RxQNqJznSGb0,4,"Good service and good portions.

The only weakest thing is the Russian salad and if you order mixed potatoes (brava sauce and aioli) they put it all together, instead of separating half of the potatoes with one sauce and the other half with the other...

However, the grilled ear, brutal, very toasted.

Despite that, in general, everything is very delicious."

ChIJyzBPB-MlQg0R65JDm1PTTMI,5,"Great ""Cocido Madrile√±o"". A neighborhood restaurant packed with locals. Reservations recommeneded on weekends. Friendly service."
ChIJyzBPB-MlQg0R65JDm1PTTMI,5,Delicious tapas and huge cocido served by friendly staff. It is a definite most if you want a good cocido! Defo returning to try other dishes on their menu
ChIJyzBPB-MlQg0R65JDm1PTTMI,3,"Mixed feelings about this place... They definitely know how to make a great ""cocido"", and in general all dishes have a good quality at a reasonable cost. However, delivering them took their overworked waiters (amazing professionals, polite and hard-working) more than 2 and a half hours, probably due to an wrongly dimensioned kitchen. The terrace is well located far from car traffic.

If you're not in a rush, a good place indeed."
ChIJyzBPB-MlQg0R65JDm1PTTMI,5,"Our waiter, Luis, was amazing! With every drink we got good sized tapas and really good attention. A place to repeat. Try it, you will not be disappointed."

ChIJl99Q2eIlQg0Rporfz6dkpy8,3,"Good weekend menu, although somewhat expensive (‚Ç¨18 without drinks).
The terrace is wonderful, it is super comfortable.
The food was all quite good and normal quantity, except for the cheesecake which was laser cut.
The service was a bit of a disaster and borderline, but hey, I guess the girl was having a bad day."
ChIJl99Q2eIlQg0Rporfz6dkpy8,5,"Bar-restaurant with a small but cozy interior and a large terrace surrounded by gardens üòÄüå≥

For me this is one of the best restaurants in the area. They have a super complete daily menu for ‚Ç¨11 that also varies every week, so if you go Monday and Monday you won't eat the same thing üòÄüçΩÔ∏è On Saturdays and Sundays the menu is more expensive.

Also on the menu they have a lot of quite large portions and very well priced. I 100% recommend having one of their burgersüçî and trying the homemade tiramisuüò¨"
ChIJl99Q2eIlQg0Rporfz6dkpy8,5,Perfect little terrace to have a drink! Delicious appetizers! Clean and wonderful waiters! With mention to Dani and Andrada! It's nice to be surrounded by such professional and beautiful people! Thank you!!!!
ChIJW1E2AfIlQg0Ryc41Izt1xHs,1,Well my friends and i was having drinks nearby then we decided to have a bite some of us ordered barbecued checkin and some of us ordered fried chicken all of them wasn't what we expected it was full of oil soaked with salt and full of curry it doesn't taste well   nor near what you will expect i would never try to go there again but the quantity was more than enough
ChIJW1E2AfIlQg0Ryc41Izt1xHs,5,It was a great experience to have some nice food in that area. The foods were amazing and the service was excellent. Looking forward to come here more often
ChIJW1E2AfIlQg0Ryc41Izt1xHs,5,"Very delicious, highly recommended, will go again"
ChIJW1E2AfIlQg0Ryc41Izt1xHs,4,Delicious food

ChIJwdhkeHslQg0RuTrVP1b0bzA,5,"I have eaten a complete stew there and I was to die for, I couldn't eat it all and I am a good eater.

Fast and attentive service.
Good atmosphere.
I will return."
ChIJwdhkeHslQg0RuTrVP1b0bzA,4,"A daily menu that, being Wednesday, has consisted of Complete Cooked.
The soup is very delicious and the stew is very good. Lots of quantity and good price on the daily menu. to return"
ChIJwdhkeHslQg0RuTrVP1b0bzA,2,"They have changed owners and the truth is, they have lost a lot. They have renovated it and it has been very nice, in that it has improved. In everything else it has gotten worse. Expensive prices that do not correspond to the quality and quantity of food, it is not worth what it costs. The waitress who served us was in a hurry (and there were only 3 more tables occupied). I asked for lactose-free milk and I specified it twice because she didn't seem to have noticed. When she brought the coffees she went to serve me the same milk as the rest. Thank goodness I realized it and reminded her that it had to be lactose-free. Then she brought another jug, this time lactose-free. We ordered mixed croissants and an omelet skewer, the omelet was already made and on the counter, however they brought all the croissants and the omelet arrived quite a while later, when the others had already finished breakfast. Finally, when we brought the bill we checked it and it was wrong, they had given us 4 sandwiches instead of 4 croissants, the price was ‚Ç¨1 more for each one, ‚Ç¨4 more in total. We told him and he said no, they cost the same. We had to show him the menu so he could see the prices and then he agreed with us and they refunded us the difference. I could understand it if there were a lot of people, but there were only 3 other tables besides ours."
ChIJwdhkeHslQg0RuTrVP1b0bzA,5,"Renovated inn with new owners, very nice place to have breakfast with very attentive waiters, especially Javier, the tapas are incredible and the prices are very reasonable, I recommend this new inn"
ChIJwdhkeHslQg0RuTrVP1b0bzA,3,"Everything is correct except the most important thing, the prices are not in line with the neighborhood. A mixed sandwich ‚Ç¨5, it doesn't make sense."
ChIJ24D2zhwlQg0RWn94rwuGfFg,5,Ever had food from el Salvador? Go here
ChIJ24D2zhwlQg0RWn94rwuGfFg,5,"In Madrid it is fairly easy to find Latin food, but it is not always so easy to find a good place. This restaurant meets both requirements. And with a good price, too.

We arrived after 10pm and they offered us a table where we were comfortable; We caught them in full swing, with the place full, but they still served us quite quickly and brought the food in a timely manner. We ordered some tostones with shredded meat, delicious (the coleslaw was great), and also various pupusas; the pork rinds with cheese, the best. We ordered a spicy sauce to season the pupusas and it was very tasty, it gave it a special touch: I highlight it because it is not common.

Strong dishes, we left very full, and very delicious. Good attention from the waiter. We paid less than ‚Ç¨10 per person with drinks included. Unbeatable quality-quantity-price ratio. 100% recommended."
ChIJ24D2zhwlQg0RWn94rwuGfFg,4,"It's quiet, you don't have to wait long, what I like most is that it's fresh, freshly made food."
ChIJ24D2zhwlQg0RWn94rwuGfFg,5,Excellent Salvadoran place to share and enjoy delicious pupusas. The attention of 10.
ChIJ24D2zhwlQg0RWn94rwuGfFg,5,Everything you order from the menu is great and the dishes come with enough quantity to share. It is open from Wednesday to Monday with various offers.
ChIJ56pwBwomQg0RoPmNCcG3SeE,1,"I ordered a few days ago and at what time. The spring rolls were extremely greasy. So much so that after eating them we could only try the rest. Average, but also greasy Chinese bread. It even made us feel bad. I put everything left over in the trash. Very bad food, at least the one they served us. I won't order there again. From other previous comments I see that not much has changed."
ChIJ56pwBwomQg0RoPmNCcG3SeE,1,"Think hard about ordering here, if you don't want to waste your money, this restaurant should be sent to health care. I have never seen such vomiting food in my life. Everything is super greasy, the chicken is crunchy, the only thing crunchy about it is what makes my stomach crunch right now from hunger, for having thrown the food directly into the trash as I opened it. The raw chicken, the crunchy part was a jelly, I know what it was and with bloody parts, and with a scary yellowish color. And the other dishes, like that, greasy and disgusting. I don't know how these places can still be open. Without a second hesitation, I will not order here again. And for the sake of your health, you shouldn't either."
ChIJ56pwBwomQg0RoPmNCcG3SeE,1,"I placed an order for home delivery and it took an hour and a half to arrive. After more than an hour I called the restaurant and they told me that it had already left without even asking me who I was or what order I was referring to, and after that it still took another half hour to arrive with the restaurant being less than 10 minutes from my house. A disaster, I will not order here again."
ChIJ56pwBwomQg0RoPmNCcG3SeE,1,"I've been waiting for my order for more than an hour and a half, and it says it's been out for 25 minutes, and no matter how true it is, it's going to arrive ice cold. Shameful, they don't really provide home delivery service."
ChIJ56pwBwomQg0RoPmNCcG3SeE,1,"When the former owner opened it years ago, it was spectacular...
But today I have not been in a worse place in my life.... with all the sincerity in the world it is for them to close it, I can't believe how this restaurant can be open.  In the end!!"

ChIJra_9ksonQg0RKWgpCDeZRZE,5,We are doing a tapas route through the neighborhood and so far it is the bar that we liked the most! What good ribs!
ChIJra_9ksonQg0RKWgpCDeZRZE,1,"Yesterday, Sunday 05-12-24, I went with some friends to have a drink. The first thing that caught my attention is that it is the second bar run/where Dominicans work, who do not add a slice of lemon to the soft drinks. The appetizer, loin, very delicious, it must be said. The atmosphere, typical in these cases, YouTube music, at full volume, spit out from a television. Hey, it's your bar and it's what it is, no problem. But what cannot be, is that you are sitting down, calling the employees (a boy and a girl), making waves with your hand......and they stop serving you, because they are laughing, loudly, at the bar, with another compatriot......in the end, well, I paid for the two soft drinks and the beer and went to another place where they were more professional. It's a shame, because the place is quite good, nice and clean......but the service......well, that doesn't correspond to what is typical in this part of the world......"
ChIJra_9ksonQg0RKWgpCDeZRZE,5,"They have recently changed owners, the girl who runs it now is excellent when it comes to serving you and dealing with customers."

ChIJPf1IDAomQg0RuYu7pLg7J7Y,2,"The evolution of neighborhood bars. But where? Chinese owners, Latin cooks, and traditional tapas: ear, blood, Torres os. But the clientele is not maintained. With change, history and empathy with the usual customer are lost. It is the same bar that appears called Oro II, on the fa√ßade and the whole the two names appear, in a different place."
ChIJPf1IDAomQg0RuYu7pLg7J7Y,5,"I became a regular customer because of the excellent service and because I felt cared for at all times.

ChIJv0ZlZwomQg0RolglhuMd7Oc,5,"Fell upon this place by accident during one of our walks through the city and what a great surprise it was.

A hidden gem. I highly recommend this place for great food and atmosphere."

Beautiful art!!! make sure to come downstairs"
ChIJYay6fbklQg0Rjj2wZMJyor4,5,"Restaurant with a great atmosphere of live Creole music that will transport you to Peru without leaving Madrid while you enjoy eating delicious traditional Peruvian cuisine

We tried TACACHO for the first time, a typical hearty dish very popular in the Peruvian jungle with cured meat and green banana.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The MARINE ROUND is ideal to share between 2/3 people where 5 marine dishes are combined into one and if you also accompany it with chicha morada, it is the best!

üî∏Northern ceviche is one of my favorite dishes. With fish bathed in tiger's milk accompanied by onion, Peruvian corn, glazed sweet potato and canchita

üî∏Very good fish chicharron battered and fried with Peruvian spices

üî∏Very soft the Lima cause with octopus, Pressed potato with yellow chili and lemon, stuffed with octopus tartar, avocado mousse, egg and botija olive sauce

ChIJYay6fbklQg0Rjj2wZMJyor4,5,"We have gone twice to try the menu of the day. 13 euros, and a good amount on their plates.
They give you the option of chicha morada in the drink, which many Peruvian restaurants do not.
The saut√©ed noodles were exquisite, the noodles were just right and had good seasoning.
The aguadito soup is also very rich and tasty.
What lacked salt and the most seasoned sauce with that Peruvian touch of spiciness was the aj√≠ de gallina, which seemed to me to be a bland and flavorless dish. In fact we had to ask him to give us salt so that the sauce tasted like something.
Otherwise everything is correct. They play singers in the evening and the downstairs is very spacious.
The staff's attention is also good.
We will return to try more dishes."
ChIJ44lIBL4lQg0RRp_OXvgjo4s,5,"All in all, great experience, the portions of food is a lot so a plate is good for 2 hungry people.
The place is always filled so I recommend you come in a bit earlier."
ChIJ44lIBL4lQg0RRp_OXvgjo4s,3,"I went on a Friday lunchtime and the place was really busy. I opted for the menu del dia:
Positive: large portions, the rice dish was OK.
Negative: wonton soup was really basic, very slow service, they don't serve alcohol free beer.
Conclusion: This place is OK, but not that special."
ChIJ44lIBL4lQg0RRp_OXvgjo4s,5,Lovely local place. Very popular by the locals. Good quality food.
ChIJ44lIBL4lQg0RRp_OXvgjo4s,3,"The moment I got there I had to approach someone to tell me if there was an available table for one person. I was assigned to a table and I was waiting for someone to take my order, after several minutes nobody did, naturally I asked to a waitress if she could take my order and she said she was busy, then asked to another and she said she was sorry she couldn't help me, I was about to leave the place when a nice gentleman asked me if someone had taken my order - I said no and he nicely did. The food was really great, I had a ""combinado de langostinos"", half order of fried wontons and an inkacola. The atmosphere was really loud so if you have plans to chat with your friends over lunch I suggest you the take out or delivery option. A nice waiter gave me my bill and other one thanked me for visiting them. At the beginning it was an unpleasant experience but everything changed with a nice gesture of a waiter. It's hard enough to have lunch by myself so I really appreciate when people is empathetic and nice to me when I'm having my food."

ChIJhX_AWiMlQg0RfSkLIkwVNx4,5,Mohamed allowed us to have a private party at his premises. We were 80 people and we had a great time. The attention and service of the staff has been great.

Although they should improve on not taking so long to deliver the the food, in my opinion they should put more staffBecause if they take too long they lose customers because not only is it that they are late but the place is small and fills up very quickly which makes people who arrive and there are no tables decide to leave.
If you ask me, the truth is the food is very good, I recommend going y and the personal treatment is quite friendly"
ChIJP5qOngomQg0RFcB_wOZAIFk,1,"To begin with, since we arrived, the service of the guy who was at the bar in a bad manner with a bad face talking on the phone the entire time we were in the service did not deign to approach the table to take note of the order, he did it from the bar with reluctance. asking what we wanted to eat

We ordered some nachos, a chicken with slices and a roast beef

All the food was based on flavorless sauces which took away the flavor of the entire dish.

The tasteless nachos had no cheese to replace the cheese, they added a sauce made of sour cream with milk which tasted more like milk than anything else

The chicken with slices had no flavor at all and the slices were medium raw, well, it was the most fried tomato sauce in the supermarket, the food tasted more like the sauce than the chicken itself at home, the only bite that was brought to the wedding It was sauce, the plating seems awful to me, serving a chicken in a plastic basket with a bag so that the abundant sauce does not come out

The roast beef had nothing, it was cooked meat that had a flavor that had already passed days ago, which they tried to hide the flavor by adding another type of sauce. In the photos of the place, no dish has the meat tomorrow in sauce.

When we were in the place we could clearly hear the cook telling the waiter that it smelled bad but she knew well that she had already tried it, I guess she was trying to cover the smell or taste of the roast meat with the sauce.

Aver is a constructive criticism that takes into account their character and the way they serve because if you go to a place to eat it is to have a pleasant time and not have a bad time and leave hungry since the food cannot be eaten"
ChIJP5qOngomQg0RFcB_wOZAIFk,1,"In my experience, I do not recommend the baleadas since they were not up to par, raw edges, the baleada with a heavy consistency as if it were reheated, cold and very heavy. Nothing freshly made and above all soft and light.

My review is to improve it, not to harm it, much less, I like to support my people but when something has to be improved it has to be said."
ChIJP5qOngomQg0RFcB_wOZAIFk,5,"Authentic Honduran Food, with traditional flavors, Delicious!! Very cozy atmosphere! Highly recommended"
ChIJP5qOngomQg0RFcB_wOZAIFk,4,"It is not the best bar in Madrid, but they have traditional and delicious Honduran food. It is worth traveling from the center to here to try their cuisine and have a different experience.

Of course, there were 4 of us and we ordered 4 dishes and it was too much food (the same thing always happens to us). The corn tamales are dense, so count on sharing and eating half a tamalito per person, at most."
ChIJI-MGnwomQg0RtGM3ucOhlLA,4,"Excellent food!!
Very good service, and quick cooking to the table
Worst, it's a bit narrow in space. Mostly toilets"
ChIJI-MGnwomQg0RtGM3ucOhlLA,4,"Loved the food, first time i gave them 5 stars, our second visit it was just too slow"
ChIJI-MGnwomQg0RtGM3ucOhlLA,5,Marvilosa
ChIJI-MGnwomQg0RtGM3ucOhlLA,4,"Small restaurant, correct, clean with typical Honduran preparations, also note that they prepare very delicious juices and have drinks and typical products from the area. We ordered some Nachos to share, correct and ample portion. Chicken with slices, a large portion of fried chicken with plantain chips, enchiladas that tasted almost like Nachos and a Fish (fried sea bream) that was just right and not greasy at all. A recommended place if you want to try Honduran cuisine at a good price."
ChIJI-MGnwomQg0RtGM3ucOhlLA,5,Excellent Honduran food! Pride catracho enterprising people 100% recommended! Everything clean and the food delicious!
ChIJhargngomQg0Rks8hJagHwaw,5,"We stumbled upon this place while starving after a long walk, and although it didn't look like it would offer amazing food, it actually did! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and other than the usual items there were some interesting types of meat on the menu for the thrill seekers. Highly recommend!"
ChIJhargngomQg0Rks8hJagHwaw,5,"The owner of the restaurant is very charming and also invited us to a barbecue appetizer made by himself, the staff is young and very friendly and attentive and there is nothing missing on the table. There is a very cheap menu with food especially the grilled meat on the menu and the delicious dessert and also the wine on the terrace overlooking the lake. I loved eating there and I will return."
ChIJhargngomQg0Rks8hJagHwaw,5,"In the heart of Nueva Numancia (Vallecas), a cozy place to stop, well attended by its owners, him moving the bar and her in the kitchen preparing some sensational tapas; Although it may sound clich√©, you feel at home. You can have the typical third of Mahou, a vermouth on tap, or a kangaroo burger... You decide."
ChIJhargngomQg0Rks8hJagHwaw,5,"An Interesting place to have a hamburger with some homemade fries. They also have different types of ""special"" meats: crocodile, kangaroo,... Vallecas always surprises you with places like this."
ChIJhargngomQg0Rks8hJagHwaw,5,"Very delicious 100% Colombian food, very familiar place and excellent service. Super recommended, very good prices"
ChIJhYpCj_2HQQ0R6b4A-qtDbq4,1,"What a scam!! I will never return.
You pay for the food, with a rather limited variety and BE CAREFUL THE DRINK IS PAID SEPARATELY!
That it's Halloween and you decorate the facilities seems fine to me, but that you put disgusting and disgusting decoration on all the dishes seems in bad taste to me, I don't want to be ruder than the appearance of all the dishes that were there. I'm sorry but I can't keep quiet.
And the price for the buffet in relation to the quality and variety seems like a joke to me."
ChIJhYpCj_2HQQ0R6b4A-qtDbq4,3,"The products are not completely fresh, we feel that they are reheated.
It is also very noisy given the large size of the room.
The staff is friendly but not very helpful if you don't go to them to ask for a pitcher of water for example.
However, we ate very well there and for an all-you-can-eat amusement park buffet it remains reasonable. For adults it is around 16 euros. For children several price scales."
ChIJhYpCj_2HQQ0R6b4A-qtDbq4,4,"Perfect restaurant to eat quietly with the family, almost without queues, with a good quality-price ratio (17.90/adult) drink not included but you can bring your bottle of water.
The buffet has salads, fried foods, paella that was good, roast chicken, lasagna, pasta, some fish, side dishes and desserts, the fruit was in bad condition but the homemade desserts were good. To me it seemed like a better option than the classic burger with potatoes."
ChIJhYpCj_2HQQ0R6b4A-qtDbq4,3,"Typical battle food from an amusement park, zoo, etc. For the alternatives that there are in the park, it is not bad because there is usually less queue and it is better than a sandwich for ‚Ç¨8 like other restaurants have inside the park. The drink is paid separately."
ChIJhYpCj_2HQQ0R6b4A-qtDbq4,1,"Expensive, very expensive. Drink not included. The food was not very varied and of very very low quality. Desserts are the only thing that could happen... Don't go in, avoid it, it's better to get some fries from a machine and you'll have a better dinner... Horrible"

ChIJtfKWZP4nQg0ROp3AZxB1oiE,5,"I was with some friends on the terrace this week and we were delighted.
The service is magnificent and the portions are very good.
The bravas and the ear are highly recommended. The grilled vegetables are also very delicious.
Excellent cleaning.
We will return üëçüëç"
ChIJtfKWZP4nQg0ROp3AZxB1oiE,1,"If you have the best bravas in Madrid here, I am Jesus Christ. I was with my mother the other day and they were very bad, but bad bad, the worst I have ever eaten. Reheated, stiff and with an aguachirri sauce that only had paprika. If this is what the best bravas are like, I can't even imagine what the ear will be like, which they also advertise. The girl who served us was quite lazy, her treatment was cold and detached, she barely said anything, and the atmosphere of the bar, there was only one couple very old with alcohol, quite sinister and shabby. I will never go again in my life and please remove the sign from the window of the best bravas in Madrid. You have not tasted a truly good Patata Brava in your life. Damn the time I set foot there. Wasted money."
ChIJSzrCoAGIQQ0RbIwln_3KW-Y,5,The cuisine works from 20 in the evening
ChIJSzrCoAGIQQ0RbIwln_3KW-Y,5,"The best place to eat if you are near Batan. Just your regular neighbourhood bar and restaurant. Big portions, very tasty, very affordable.
First time, I ordered their pig's ears (out of curiosity) and could not finish that huge portion even though it was tasty. I took the leftovers home and those kept me fed for 2 more days. I then dropped in with a colleague two days later, and we had another great meal and drink.
Nice and very personal service. I'd give it 4.5 stars because it's just very basic looking on the inside but the food and service are great..."
ChIJSzrCoAGIQQ0RbIwln_3KW-Y,5,"Great place for dinner, big portions and options for vegetarians. We‚Äôve really enjoyed our meal there!"
ChIJSzrCoAGIQQ0RbIwln_3KW-Y,5,Nice place... Especially if you are a Real Madrid fan!
ChIJSzrCoAGIQQ0RbIwln_3KW-Y,5,Ok
ChIJ-wF_fv4nQg0Ra1QW4jlbDho,5,"Loved it here!  Staying just around the corner on a weekend break in Madrid and couldn't be bothered to go into central Madrid for an evening meal. I managed to get a reserved table despite my terrible Spanish. Very friendly people, lively atmosphere and great fresh food at reasonable prices. A typical, friendly neighbourhood cafeteria with great tapas and platos. Highly recommended."
ChIJ-wF_fv4nQg0Ra1QW4jlbDho,5,Friendly hard working friendly staff. Me gusta mucho
ChIJ-wF_fv4nQg0Ra1QW4jlbDho,5,Great service and friendly atmosphere.
ChIJ-wF_fv4nQg0Ra1QW4jlbDho,5,Very good coffee!! Good deal!!
ChIJ-wF_fv4nQg0Ra1QW4jlbDho,5,"If you are lovers of bravas, this place is essential. If you like squid (really) be sure to visit it. Wonderful squid. Well, everything you ask for will be scandalous. In addition, they give you the choice between several appetizers for each round. What more could you ask for?"
ChIJERBNqDSJQQ0RrkRRB7VoX9Y,5,"For this money probably best food, what I could imagine. I really enjoy the food and I'm sure, next time I'll visit this place again. Service was also nice and kind. Only problem was the slot machine. It is so loud. I know, in Spain is like this, but maybe change the location."
ChIJERBNqDSJQQ0RrkRRB7VoX9Y,4,Quality food with good service and very clean dining area
ChIJERBNqDSJQQ0RrkRRB7VoX9Y,5,just everything is super good I like the place the food and the people there üôåüôåüôå
ChIJERBNqDSJQQ0RrkRRB7VoX9Y,4,"King Dinero Kebab offers a good option for those looking for fast and tasty food. Their kebabs are generous in size and with fresh ingredients. The service is fast, although the place can fill up at peak times. Ideal for an economical and filling craving."
ChIJERBNqDSJQQ0RrkRRB7VoX9Y,5,"A nice little establishment with tasty and cheap food, what more could you want..."
ChIJy0iFK36JQQ0RAr2cCt5g19M,4,"I didn't eat there but the area is nice since there are SpongeBob's water games and there are several spots to take photos. The bad thing is that people crowd a lot in that area.
The prices in the gift shop are a little high but that is to be expected."
ChIJy0iFK36JQQ0RAr2cCt5g19M,5,"The only drawback is that it is perhaps a little expensive for what it offers, but you can understand it, since it is inside the park, in the Nickelodeon area.

The quality of the food is higher than the average fast food establishment: for example, the chicken nuggets are delicious.

Another point that could be improved are the toys on the children's menu: they could be themed to the park."
ChIJy0iFK36JQQ0RAr2cCt5g19M,1,Absolute disaster with the allergy issue. They do not have updated information and what the cook says does not correspond to what appears in the allergen table. The option they give us is for the child to eat 2 sausages without bread or a gluten-free menu that has nothing to do with a nut allergy.
ChIJy0iFK36JQQ0RAr2cCt5g19M,1,"Being on the beach with 35¬∞ is way... But eating at that temperature without air is the worst... Place without air conditioning, very poorly organized service and with very little hygiene. There are better options to eat, I don't recommend this one. Needless to say we will not return what a horrible experience."
ChIJy0iFK36JQQ0RAr2cCt5g19M,4,"You must place the order in the machines outside. On the paper or purchase receipt, the tracking code for your order appears in the upper corner. Go to the counter to watch for delivery. Excellent and fast service. With the purchase of two adult menus and an annual bonus, they give you a complete children's menu of nuggets or hamburgers."
ChIJhfS213WJQQ0RQVRxYe0QGFw,1,"Fizemos o pedido no ecr√£ e n√£o saiu o cupom de recibo, fomos at√© ao balc√£o e disseram que ter√≠amos que fazer outro pedido pois o da m√°quina de pedidos seria anulado e o valor seria reembolsado . E foi nos descontado duas vezes e o primeiro pedido n√£o foi reembolsado o valor de 54,91‚Ç¨."
ChIJhfS213WJQQ0RQVRxYe0QGFw,1,"Burger King from the amusement park!
After half an hour waiting in line for the ordering machines, because you can't order directly at the table. Several things that you select said ""not available"" the screen kept sticking, if you want to cancel the order forget it. Because there is almost never anyone at the box! When I ask about the ""2 for"" menus they tell me that they don't have them in this place, because they have ""airport rate."" We all know the prices for ""airport rate."" They could put it so as not to waste time waiting in line... The most expensive hamburgers I have ever eaten in a Burger King! Oh, of course the app offers don't work there! There were several of us who wanted to scan the code and nothing, and when I selected the offers in the app, mysteriously the screen went blank and did nothing..."
ChIJhfS213WJQQ0RQVRxYe0QGFw,5,I have gone with my son and it was very good. They served us the food very quickly and freshly made. The prices are very good
ChIJhfS213WJQQ0RQVRxYe0QGFw,1,"I'm going to talk about the Burger King in the amusement park... First of all, I say that the service is bad because the poor guys don't give more desi for so many orders per second... but they don't stop for a second and they do their job well. That being said, I won't be coming back. We arrived at 2:40 p.m. and ate at 4:05 p.m.!!!! You have to order at the machine as there is quite a queue but then the wait for your order is unbearable. But the most outrageous thing are the prices! Almost double what it costs at any Burger King, plus there are no offers or coupons and of course neither is the park voucher discount. It is quite expensive in price and time. One and no more."
ChIJhfS213WJQQ0RQVRxYe0QGFw,1,It seems very strong to me that there are no promotions in the amusement park and that the children's menu is worth twice as much being the same company. In the end we went to a burger in my neighborhood and I paid half for the same products and with promotions. I put one star because I can't put less
ChIJV-s5awaIQQ0R_0CbZDFFqew,5,(Bar section) My buddy and I stopped in for a drink and then we decided we were hungry too.  The kitchen was closed for the post lunch rest (very normal in Spain).  We asked for some bocadillos de lomo without much expectation. They were delicious! The pork loin was juicy and cooked just right.  There seemed to be some cheddar cheese spread on there that I did not think existed in Spain and there was a simple but tasty sliced cheese included. So good!
ChIJV-s5awaIQQ0R_0CbZDFFqew,4,"After a family day at Parque de Atracciones de Madrid, we were driving by when my wife noticed a chinese restaurant. We went in at 22:10 (three adults, two children). Not a fancy restaurant, but that doesn't matter to us, because we value the food and we know that, sometimes, these places are hidden gold.
We were all hungry, it's true, we ordered the house combo for four and the food was absolutely delicious! The ribs were the weakest link, not just because they seemed out of place in a chinese restaurant but because they were dry. The rest, my friends, was amazing!
We ate and drank so much... and still payed 60 euros.
Check this place out! Beware: no luxury whatsoever (it has air conditioning, though), no fancy service, just simple chinese people working and serving food that we loved.
Isn't that what really matters?"
ChIJV-s5awaIQQ0R_0CbZDFFqew,5,"Normal price but Great food.
We took lunch for 6 person in it was amazing!

Except waiter which stranded near as all the time to harry up us, because we came 20 minutes before closing the restaurant."
ChIJV-s5awaIQQ0R_0CbZDFFqew,3,"The restaurant is quite economical. The food tastes pretty good but the amount of fat is excessive. Almost all dishes swim in oil.
The best on the menu are the noodles in all their presentations, the house rice, the roasted pork ribs and the spring rolls are also very good.
It is right in front of the Bat√°n Line 10 metro station. The decoration of the place is quite depressing and the atmosphere is not much better."
ChIJV-s5awaIQQ0R_0CbZDFFqew,1,"My horrible experience, the smell and smoke of the place is the worst. Everything very dirty and very unfriendly. We ordered several things and all were bad, some were itchy. Good fatal. You just have to see the entrance of the place and the disgusting facades.
I don't fly"
ChIJ2-ArAJuHQQ0RL08Bquo119E,5,The truth is that it's great to be able to have a llao llao at the amusement park. With the bonus they are cheaper and they are delicious. I will always recommend the pistachio cream with muesli. Fast service. You are now in front of the Vertigo attraction.
ChIJ2-ArAJuHQQ0RL08Bquo119E,1,"At the Madrid amusement park in the carousel truck, ATTENTION OF 0, (Saturday 08/24 about 4 p.m.) two girls serving, I have had to abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying the product and leave quickly, almost running, due to the bad treatment What the staff gave me and their disgusted faces when they looked at me at the beginning and then for asking if they could add more nuts... (I think you usually pay an extra and that's it. Well, he tells me no, it's the measure... his way of speaking to you, arrogant, arrogant with very bad manners, adding a small amount of the rest as if to the contrary and saying it's the measure... he's not the first one I've bought from him. measure and of course 2 pieces of pineapple and two strawberries are not the measure if I manage to drink the llaollao in my stomach it breaks!!! I don't understand how you can even contemplate the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhaving staff like that for a job face to the public in which they have to deal with people... From the Fourth Millennium we are going... a terrible experience... How scary! Zero recommended.."
ChIJ2-ArAJuHQQ0RL08Bquo119E,1,"The person who works at the llaollao stand told me that the app was not useful inside the park and then I saw everyone putting in the QR code to earn points, plus I paid my extra topping and it seems that they charge him for kicking me out"
ChIJ2-ArAJuHQQ0RL08Bquo119E,1,"Fatal. The girls who are serving there are ridiculous (today's date August 20, 2024, around 3:30 p.m.) they force you to pay even before you say the toppings you want on your ice cream, while you are taking out the card to pay the other one serving you is rushing you to choose topping, or I pay or choose topping, not both, on top of that, there were no people, it was us (who came together) and a mother and her two children, they do not finish serving us and They tell us to leave, once we have already paid, excuse me? If you haven't even finished serving us? Fatal, a horrible experience, the short girl with glasses was super rude with people and the other one I won't even tell you..."
ChIJ2-ArAJuHQQ0RL08Bquo119E,5,"Very good service and my llaollao was delicious, with a lot of dark chocolate sauce the way I like it üòã The best for the current heat"
ChIJc9y_KcmJQQ0RYu2JHO2greY,4,Great burgers and staff are super nice. Only little minus was ice cream and profiteroles. Prices are worth the food.
ChIJc9y_KcmJQQ0RYu2JHO2greY,1,"The service was super slow and not attentive, the waitress mixed up orders. Sangria came without wineü§£ We ordered pizza and it was prepared with supermarket pizza base, the one wich is precooked and froze. We were shocked, how the place can have ""pizza"" in its name and do not prepare the dough in house! Huge disappointment. Only advantage is that the place looks cozy and reasonably clean."
ChIJc9y_KcmJQQ0RYu2JHO2greY,5,Great food and great service at affordable prices.
ChIJc9y_KcmJQQ0RYu2JHO2greY,5,"Great snacks and drinks with great customer service. Ask for Sharon, our star waitress. The bar is nothing without her üôåüèªüëèüèª"
ChIJc9y_KcmJQQ0RYu2JHO2greY,5,"Great food, nice staff, good location"
ChIJHVyZR7WHQQ0RjGlb2psS9cA,5,For a restaurant in an amusement park this is surprisingly good food. The kids shared the burger with fries and us we shared the spare ribs and all was delicious and fresh. It's a good option to share because the portions are pretty big. The prices are on the high side but at least you pay for what you get. Good size plate and good quality. What a pleasant surprise in an amusement park!!
ChIJHVyZR7WHQQ0RjGlb2psS9cA,3,"For an amusement park restaurant it's great, but it's not exactly what I would call a GOOD restaurant. The Caesar salad was actually pretty good but the cheese was a bit off. We also ordered a squid sandwich, but the squid was unseasoned and pretty bland. We also ordered a crepe that they forgot to bring to our table and brought the wrong order but upon confronting them about it, the staff was really nice and brought the correct order."
ChIJHVyZR7WHQQ0RjGlb2psS9cA,1,"Wow, how awful is the food here! The gluten free vegan burger, which came with crisps, was horrendous. The bun was rock hard, the burger itself was just warm. I would have complained but as I don't speak Spanish it was pointless. My boyfriend had really average ribs and chips, nothing special at all. Over ‚Ç¨40 for this with one Coca Cola. Avoid at all costs! The only good thing is the indoor seating, and water misters if you do sit outside. The park can surely do better if they just bothered. Gluten free food should be good, why are we getting overcharged for rubbish?"
ChIJHVyZR7WHQQ0RjGlb2psS9cA,4,"Within the limited range of places to eat in El Parque de Atracciones, this is the best quality choice to eat with your family üë™, why?

- The quality of the products surprised us for an a la carte restaurant located in a complex like the Amusement Park.

I recommend for children:

1) Portion of squid, which we ate were very good and soft.

2) Children's Burger. üçî Good meat accompanied by curved cut potatoes.

3) Ham Croquettes. They taste like Ham and the crunchy batter.

I recommend for Adults:

1) Rib to share. The meat üçñ is very soft and the sauce is very rich. The downside is that they didn't heat it up much. The piece was already cooked.

2) Chicken salad ü•ó. Very good. The lettuce was not limp.

In short. We know that eating in a tourist complex is always expensive (it cost us ‚Ç¨73 with the Bonoparques discount included, although for 4 people nowadays...) but at least in this place the food does not disappoint.

Quite a few waiters and clean facilities.

Quality/Price Ratio: 8"
ChIJHVyZR7WHQQ0RjGlb2psS9cA,2,"The Mercado San Isidro restaurant is inside the Amusement Park and I must say that my experience was quite disappointing. The food they served there was simply outstanding, with nothing special to highlight. Furthermore, I was surprised by how disproportionate the prices were.

However, I must admit that the click & collect service turned out to be very useful. The ability to order food from my table and avoid long lines was a plus. At least that allowed me to save time and enjoy the park a little more.

As for the ambiance of the place, I must say that it left a lot to be desired. It was quite average and lacked charm. However, I discovered an interesting trick: if you sit in the back room, you can enjoy a prime view of the rapids attraction. It's exciting to watch people rush by while you enjoy your meal.

In summary, my experience at the Mercado San Isidro restaurant in the Amusement Park was quite mediocre. The food was simply acceptable, the prices were disproportionate, and the ambience left a lot to be desired. Luckily the click & collect service was useful and the trick of sitting in the back lounge provided an interesting view."
ChIJb9a-JOuJQQ0RlzooPv8izlE,5,I go here every week on my day off. I have a delicious glass of hot coffee and a pan con tomate. Luis treats me great and I feel peaceful here.

ChIJb9a-JOuJQQ0RlzooPv8izlE,3,Ok
ChIJb9a-JOuJQQ0RlzooPv8izlE,5,"On the birthday of a friend who lives in Bat√°n, she suggested this place to us because I was coming from the other side of the Paseo de Extremadura and only the special service and the 65 came to this area to be able to count on me and the truth is that it is great, good atmosphere, good music, has a giant screen to watch football and a table on the terrace. We ordered squid to snack on, they were very delicious because they were not coated with that thick dough and also that they are soft, very delicious ear, blood sausage with red peppers and very delicious Ali Oli potatoes. So I'm saving it to come back another time."

ChIJgX5NMhmHQQ0RlljP3CSAGfc,1,"The pizza was cold, the place was filled to the brim with dirt and used trays. No one cared to remove them or wipe down the dirty tables. Worst domino's I've ever been too."
ChIJgX5NMhmHQQ0RlljP3CSAGfc,5,Dominooooooooooooooos pizza
ChIJgX5NMhmHQQ0RlljP3CSAGfc,4,They give a 10% discount if you have Bonoparque. The queue has been a bit chaotic because they have two points for charging and receiving orders. The portions are good. Quite large pieces that are very filling.
ChIJgX5NMhmHQQ0RlljP3CSAGfc,1,"The supposedly normal and more expensive pizzas are understandable, horrible, tiny, impossible to get smaller. The unmade reheated pizzas are not even broken on top and they give you wooden cutlery that doesn't cut a single fly.

Saturday nights are super cool but I like that you even make friends. The terrace is cool and they are usually full. Only Dominican music. The music inside is very loud."
ChIJn_4KOv8nQg0RwmF24eyRxfU,5,"The place is quiet and I went with children, everything was fine, although they don't have a children's menu for some dishes, they make you a small portion. And they manage it. Good prices and very good taste"
ChIJqwTPMP8nQg0RM_FpfhzlMkw,5,Fantastic real place.. in love drinking my beer and tasting tapas.. and the waiters are pure fun!!!
ChIJqwTPMP8nQg0RM_FpfhzlMkw,5,"While looking for an authentic Spanish tapas bar in the La Latina neighborhood, I stumbled across this place during my trip to Madrid and it was one of the best travel experiences ever. Although I don't speak Spanish, I was so graciously welcomed by the other guests and waiters and came to enjoy not only traditional vermut, plenty of free tapas but also an introduction to local music. The price-performance ratio was more than fair and when I paid my bill I even got an extra glass of vermut on the house. I'll definitely come back next time I am in Madrid and I recommend it to everyone looking for an authentic Spanish culinary experience!"
ChIJqwTPMP8nQg0RM_FpfhzlMkw,5,Best restaurant in my area! I would recommend this place 100% and the Waiters are very friendly !
ChIJqwTPMP8nQg0RM_FpfhzlMkw,5,Fast and good food at cheap price
ChIJqwTPMP8nQg0RM_FpfhzlMkw,5,Gay friendly
ChIJK2LmxCMnQg0Ru1iJCL_hro4,5,"We are residents of the neighborhood and the restaurant caught our attention, we decided to go in and it was a great decision, the food was delicious, value for money and quality. We each ate a marine trio and we loved it! Although you cannot pay by card, there are other options, we will return to taste more dishes of great Peruvian cuisine"
ChIJK2LmxCMnQg0Ru1iJCL_hro4,5,"I highly recommend this restaurant, the food is spectacular and very very delicious, everything is delicious, the best ceviche and leche de tigre that I have tried in a long time, the service is really excellent, we can't wait to return. Thank you so much"
ChIJK2LmxCMnQg0Ru1iJCL_hro4,4,Newly opened Peruvian restaurant. There is no menu yet but they served me fish soup and rice with seafood and chick for ‚Ç¨12. I will return to try other flavors.
ChIJK2LmxCMnQg0Ru1iJCL_hro4,5,A cozy place to have a delicious breakfast with the Peruvian flavor that we miss so much üòã we ate a delicious bread with chicharr√≥n and we were looking forward to a good ceviche...we will return!!
ChIJK2LmxCMnQg0Ru1iJCL_hro4,5,"Today I ordered four different dishes and I was surprised, the best tiger's milk I have tried in 9 years"
ChIJPyAuz8snQg0RtmmJd8XNAeI,5,"I had the gyro meat platter, huge portion, great taste"
ChIJPyAuz8snQg0RtmmJd8XNAeI,5,Test sooo good... and price is cheaper...
ChIJPyAuz8snQg0RtmmJd8XNAeI,5,Fantastic experience in affordable range.
ChIJPyAuz8snQg0RtmmJd8XNAeI,5,‚Äèwe will happy together
ChIJPyAuz8snQg0RtmmJd8XNAeI,1,"We place an order at home.
The half roast chicken was thick skin and bones, we thought it was a shame and when we separated the meat it didn't even reach 150 grams of meat... half a chicken seriously? We ordered aquarius with that menu and they brought another drink.
We also ordered a meat burger and a breaded chicken burger arrived with twice as much bread as the breaded steak.
And they do not take care of claims."
ChIJ04BNH_8nQg0R-3y63vqdc04,5,"Although the owner doesn't speak English, he is very kind and we came to an understanding. Very good local food and reasonable prices. You should try patatas bravas. I recommend!"
ChIJ04BNH_8nQg0R-3y63vqdc04,5,"A nice place, excellent service, good food and acceptable portions."
ChIJ04BNH_8nQg0R-3y63vqdc04,5,"Excellent attention from the cook, very friendly, and tremendous flavor of the food.  A 100% recommended place to have breakfast in Madrid."
ChIJ04BNH_8nQg0R-3y63vqdc04,5,"We took a trip to Madrid and stayed near the cafeteria. We discovered it when looking for a place to have breakfast and the experience was very pleasant: we ordered a mixed sandwich and a long double coffee and both corresponded perfectly to what we ordered. (I have a bad experience ordering coffees like this, because they always end up putting a cup full to the top, when what I'm really looking for is a large double tall glass; just what they gave me at this place). Thank you very much for the service!"
ChIJ04BNH_8nQg0R-3y63vqdc04,5,"Exquisite place...The appetizers before ordering surprise you with the flavor
The food is exquisite, delicious and with the best attention,
Highly recommended place for good talk and meeting friends...invited to return"
ChIJpe_KJf8nQg0R0Nj3c0OO9sI,5,Best fried chicken in Madrid! Manolo is a cool and friendly guy who always prepares piping hot chicken. Alitas de pollo and pollo asado highly recommended üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
ChIJpe_KJf8nQg0R0Nj3c0OO9sI,5,"I entered by chance and left delighted with the kindness of the owner. He served me the chicken exactly the way I like it, with a lot of broth and then when I tried it at home... delicious!!! I am very picky about roast chicken and it was just right, juicy and the broth had just the right spices and was freshly cooked, you could tell... I will definitely come back. Better to order as the owner himself recommended to me. 10üëå roast chicken"
ChIJpe_KJf8nQg0R0Nj3c0OO9sI,5,"Very good roast chicken, and excellent personal service!"
ChIJpe_KJf8nQg0R0Nj3c0OO9sI,5,"Great chickens and super cheap. It also has wings (recommended), croquettes (not so much), bread (not so much)... Ideal for a quick meal."
ChIJpe_KJf8nQg0R0Nj3c0OO9sI,5,"Super recommended site! Everything is delicious, the chickens are the best in Madrid and the potatoes, croquettes, empanadillas and peppers are very good. They also have churrer√≠a service in the mornings! The service is also good, they are very familiar. Good quality-price."
ChIJd-0kHQAnQg0RGsDDaEDtIQU,5,A nice place with very affordable prices such as a third 2 euros or a bucket with a portion 10 euros plus a variety of appetizers
ChIJd-0kHQAnQg0RGsDDaEDtIQU,5,"All very rich!!!!!
The lovely staff
Highly recommended site."
ChIJd-0kHQAnQg0RGsDDaEDtIQU,5,"Everything is great, the guys are very nice, the beer is very cold and the portions are super delicious. They opened recently and you can see that they are eager, they have added a terrace on top."
ChIJd-0kHQAnQg0RGsDDaEDtIQU,5,"One of the best bars in this neighborhood, I recommend it because the food is very good, great service, and everything at a very good price
."
ChIJd-0kHQAnQg0RGsDDaEDtIQU,5,Very good prices and very good quality. Their burgers are spectacular. A bar where you feel at home.
ChIJKQ4mHZcnQg0RSvhBUSMR9kc,1,"Please don't let anyone eat here, I went with my family to eat the menu they have at noon and the truth is I haven't eaten so badly in a while. At first they don't put a tablecloth on your table. The super small portions, the bagged fried rice that you buy in the supermarket already made, the very small beef skewers with hard meat, the tiny spring rolls, the gong bao chicken dish with almost raw red pepper, we are a total disaster. Disastrous quality-price ratio. I give it one star because I can't give it a 0."
ChIJKQ4mHZcnQg0RSvhBUSMR9kc,5,"It is a wonderful place, the owners are very friendly and quick to serve. The food is good and there is a lot of it. Clean and nice place"
ChIJKQ4mHZcnQg0RSvhBUSMR9kc,5,"A place with good treatment since they recently changed owners, very good Chinese food and always a good aperitif to have something.  A quiet place to return"
ChIJKQ4mHZcnQg0RSvhBUSMR9kc,5,"Mainly I wanted to highlight the good treatment they give in this restaurant, they are super friendly and approachable, plus their food is very delicious, the truth is that I recommend it 100% and I wish them the best, it is a very quiet place not like in other restaurants where your head hurts from listening to so many people talking, they also serve you very quickly, since they opened I go with my family and if not we order it at home but, if you want to eat in a good place and with a quiet atmosphere I recommend this one!"
ChIJKQ4mHZcnQg0RSvhBUSMR9kc,1,"Although the service is not bad, the food is normal but the portions are minimal even though they told us at the beginning that they were normal.
If you don't want to waste your money don't come to this place."
ChIJw_h60PgnQg0RwAYJU3WDaKY,5,"A really beautiful cafe bar right next to the Arco de Cubo

Very friendly staff - just a great place for a coffee. Great views of the mountains too. Such a nice place"
ChIJw_h60PgnQg0RwAYJU3WDaKY,1,"The worst thing about the waiter, terrible attention...
If you want to choose a place where Sean is rude in serving you and has terrible quality in the service and what you consume, choose this cafeteria

The lady is very nice, total disappointment when the man serves you..."
ChIJw_h60PgnQg0RwAYJU3WDaKY,1,"A week ago we ordered a portion of squid, they smelled like a garbage can with vomit, the worst. A smell so unpleasant that he had the nerve to serve them knowing that they were in poor condition, a girl almost ate them and we would surely end up being admitted to the emergency room. Luckily, we realized and returned them, he was not able to recognize his mistake or apologize for the possible food poisoning, so many years stopping on his terrace and not even a measly apology. I give him one star because less is possible. We will never return."
ChIJw_h60PgnQg0RwAYJU3WDaKY,5,"Pleasant Cafe-Bar, with terrace, all good and very well attended...."
ChIJw_h60PgnQg0RwAYJU3WDaKY,1,"Good people, I have known them for approximately 20 years, they drown in a drop of water, I ask them for explanations and they tell me that they can't, because they are busy, thank you very much and your clients for them, they don't always make a living off of them"
ChIJvbm5bgYnQg0RaZpQeN4rIrs,5,"Very good in everything, good atmosphere, excellent service and customer service"
ChIJvbm5bgYnQg0RaZpQeN4rIrs,5,"I loved their food, the Honduran seasoning brought to Spain"
ChIJvbm5bgYnQg0RaZpQeN4rIrs,5,"Great, they treat customers very well"
ChIJvbm5bgYnQg0RaZpQeN4rIrs,3,"Very good food, nothing more than the baleada, don't be so harsh and add more beans and their accessories because they sold me a Tegucigalpa-style baleada, service too Good but very bad atmosphere, a lot of people smoking drugs and that bad smell goes to the tables where you are eating has to solve that"
ChIJvbm5bgYnQg0RaZpQeN4rIrs,5,"I usually go with my friends and my sister on Saturdays and it's a great place, excellent service and good music.‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJg6N1O_knQg0RB6f9ZXH9K7o,5,Top
ChIJg6N1O_knQg0RB6f9ZXH9K7o,5,"Ugh, the chuco chicken is super delicious."
ChIJg6N1O_knQg0RB6f9ZXH9K7o,3,Eats quite well
ChIJg6N1O_knQg0RB6f9ZXH9K7o,4,The waitress is very nice and helpful
ChIJg6N1O_knQg0RB6f9ZXH9K7o,5,One of the best place to eat..
ChIJJ7wloxInQg0RsspGrCPvfUM,5,"Eating with a friend, some succulent cachopos, with grilled eggs, fried potatoes and mixed salad. In a very nice and cozy place, with great, attentive and very friendly service.
Being Sunday, they serve you paella as an appetizer, very good by the way."
ChIJJ7wloxInQg0RsspGrCPvfUM,5,"In a neighborhood where good bars are not plentiful, this has been my great discovery this summer.
To pipe it is fantastic. Galicia star beer very cold at a lower price than usual. Delicious, varied and freshly made appetizers.
To eat incredible burgers at quite affordable prices. The cachopo, without being giant, is extraordinarily delicious. With two good beef steaks and lots of cheese. The batter was perfectly achieved. Accompanied by padr√≥n pepper. All dishes with homemade potatoes.
The place has a very pleasant and quiet terrace.
The owner and waiter offers friendliness and diligent service.
You are going to think that I am the typical friend of the owner who posts reviews to inflate the statistics but you are wrong. I know all the bars in the area and this is my favorite along with another that I will not mention here but which also has its corresponding review.
In short, it is a place that is far above its competitors in the area.
Good luck."
ChIJJ7wloxInQg0RsspGrCPvfUM,5,"Food for 8 people and everything was very good, the attention and the food were up to par. We tried the torreznos, the hamburger, the churrasco and the cachopo, all highly recommended. We will repeat 100%"
ChIJJ7wloxInQg0RsspGrCPvfUM,5,"The other day we came to have a summer tinto and we were surprised by the kindness of the owner. Now we have come for breakfast and we are delighted! 10/10, mixed croissant that was not on the menu but they made it for us with great pleasure. Very rich and unbeatable price."
ChIJJ7wloxInQg0RsspGrCPvfUM,5,Essential place in the neighborhood with unbeatable product quality and service. The owners are charming and the cachopos and burgers are spectacular. It has a super quiet terrace to enjoy a more than pleasant time. 100% recommended.
ChIJpSYuaf4nQg0RRrKxZim8gsI,1,"The restaurant clearly gave me unsold leftover fried chicken. It looked really bad, I did not want to eat it. Very disappointed."
ChIJpSYuaf4nQg0RRrKxZim8gsI,5,The best dur√ºm I had in my lifeüòòüòò
ChIJpSYuaf4nQg0RRrKxZim8gsI,5,Good place to eat the lamchum is so good! And the falafel as well! Very nice workers are friendly
ChIJpSYuaf4nQg0RRrKxZim8gsI,3,"Not that great falafel and kebab. It‚Äôs ok but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. There is better stuff to eat nearby.

Price is ok. They don‚Äôt ask you what you want in your kebab/falafel, they just put in everything."
ChIJpSYuaf4nQg0RRrKxZim8gsI,1,"Rude people with traces of cockroaches passing over the iron where they make the bread, we told him to change the bread, which was on a shelf when it was dry and moldy, and he started yelling at us, and he made us leave the premises and we had to argue with the person who would give us our money back, he would never return, health would have to close these places."
ChIJXaJ7uf4nQg0R1oIl-hDwj44,4,"A quaint lunch bar at lunchtime with a truly priceworthy lunch menu. For 9‚Ç¨, i had a gazpacho as starter and a grilled (half) chicken as main course. A coffee was included and a dessert offered but politely declined because i was happily stuffed already.

Others in our party had the Cesar salad and the fish and quite enjoyed them.

Would return."
ChIJXaJ7uf4nQg0R1oIl-hDwj44,4,"The perfect  place for eat the typical ""tapas espa√±olas "" and drinking.

God atention and good food.

Big place with terrace.

Low prices."
ChIJXaJ7uf4nQg0R1oIl-hDwj44,5,Food is good and cheap they have family deals which is great they are open quite late too which is good. Very nice vibe. Employees SUPER nice and friendly and very helpful. Definitely recommend for a late night meal
ChIJXaJ7uf4nQg0R1oIl-hDwj44,5,Food was delicious and Owner is so helpful to choose food according to your taste.
ChIJXaJ7uf4nQg0R1oIl-hDwj44,5,"Its a little corner that its very cozy, the food was delicious and loved the music"
ChIJx9SaYP4nQg0RAcJxK03qzes,5,Fantastic place for tapas. Dirty as a real Spanish traditional place.. i love the atmosphere.. real!! To try if you are in the area.. 2 beers and 2 tapas ‚Ä¶ 5 euro!!!! What you what more?!
ChIJx9SaYP4nQg0RAcJxK03qzes,1,Service is too slow.. the waiter is talk too much than serving. It take 13-15mins to serve the basic breakfast . The Food is good so we dont have any problem with that.
ChIJx9SaYP4nQg0RAcJxK03qzes,5,Great place with awesome atmosphere. Staff is friendly and polite and food very tasty.

ChIJbR_56TEvQg0R94StK5AwcOc,4,"We went for my friend's Bachelorette party and we had a great time! The show was very entertaining, we laughed a lot and the hosts were very friendly."
ChIJbR_56TEvQg0R94StK5AwcOc,2,To be honest it's not worth to spend 40-45 euros at least for this place. The food is not good. You can have some fun during few shows but those can of shows can be organised by anyone at home with friends. After 1am it's a disco only.
ChIJbR_56TEvQg0R94StK5AwcOc,5,"Spectacular!! The atmosphere and the food, you have a great time, laughter is guaranteed at all times.
I give the service 4 stars simply because it was quite full and we had to ask 7 times for water to be brought, but hey, something insignificant.
I definitely recommend it and it will surely be repeated"
ChIJbR_56TEvQg0R94StK5AwcOc,5,"A very fun night. The dinner is very delicious, whenever the drink runs out they replenish it without delay. The waiters were very attentive and fast. The people who work at the show are committed to making the night fun and entertaining, it goes by very quickly. Thank you very much for your work and bringing smiles to all of us."
ChIJbR_56TEvQg0R94StK5AwcOc,5,"It is the second farewell we have celebrated with them and they do not disappoint! We laughed, we danced, we played but above all it was an unforgettable night for the future bride. The food was delicious but compared to the show it has nothing to do. I definitely recommend it and am already thinking about celebrating a birthday there too. You guys are great, thank you for giving us a great night."
ChIJQy5qkvwnQg0RgtKkvnrPv94,5,"What prices with the quality they have!!
Very friendly and attentive.
I recommend attending because of the treatment they give you.
As you can see in the photos, everything is fresh"
ChIJQy5qkvwnQg0RgtKkvnrPv94,1,It sells more paper than chicken.
ChIJQy5qkvwnQg0RgtKkvnrPv94,5,"I've been going since I arrived in the neighborhood, 7 years ago now....Everything is delicious...chicken from Galicia and eggs from happy hens. Furthermore, they serve you with joy and good humor. They make amazing marinated wings!"
ChIJQy5qkvwnQg0RgtKkvnrPv94,4,"Although it is always full, they offer you the best prices and the best quality. The best chickens and eggs are doubtless."
ChIJQy5qkvwnQg0RgtKkvnrPv94,4,Very good for tapas. Central location. Good attention.
ChIJQUWVdf0nQg0RJqAVIAPXNtQ,5,"Hands down the best neighborhood tapa bar in the area! They open early and stay late, their food is amazing and their prices are really good. Not only was this place where we ended every night, but where we ate and drank the best. The staff is absolutely wonderful, especially Juan Carlos, his hospitality made all the difference! Gracias por todo JC!"
ChIJQUWVdf0nQg0RJqAVIAPXNtQ,5,Such friendly staff and delicious free tapas! Thank you so much :)

To compare with the kebap places in the main street...where they are cheaper with better timetable operture....."
ChIJscQREeMnQg0RucbpkOu3mYA,5,normal
ChIJscQREeMnQg0RucbpkOu3mYA,5,"The best chicken shop in the neighborhood and without a doubt one of the best in Madrid. The chickens are picked and the menu is simple, with good, appetizing and very affordable options. The best? It's been like this all my life. It's nice to come buy food here!"
ChIJscQREeMnQg0RucbpkOu3mYA,5,"A chicken shop that almost doesn't exist anymore. And please, may they last for many more years. The chickens are wonderful, a little salty at times, be careful with that if it is for older people, but very juicy and tasty. French fries are addictive. If I had to ask for something, it would be that they improve the croquettes, which are frozen. But overall the best chicken in the area by far."
ChIJscQREeMnQg0RucbpkOu3mYA,5,"The best grill in the neighborhood without a doubt and I can attest that they come from other neighborhoods for their delicious chicken and more products, don't change, you are the best."
ChIJSU2_kAgoQg0RgEd6jj1vRBs,5,Ok
ChIJSU2_kAgoQg0RgEd6jj1vRBs,5,A very pleasant experience. The food on the menu is excellent and the price is ridiculous. The service is attentive and friendly. The space is spacious and cozy. We will return.
ChIJSU2_kAgoQg0RgEd6jj1vRBs,5,A very rich and excellently presented tasting menu in a very pleasant atmosphere. The room is spacious and the service is great. Congratulations to our future chefs and their teachers!
ChIJSU2_kAgoQg0RgEd6jj1vRBs,5,"From the first to the last one we have been to, we have been very pleased.
The previous visit and the explanations have made us value the work that the school has been doing and the number of people who have been trained there and not only in culinary arts, but also in values.
The treatment has been of high quality from each and every one of the people in the dining room and there is no one that stands out more than another, everyone has been perfect, attentive, helpful and friendly, but professional.
The menu presented. Balanced, very well presented, it seemed like we weren't going to be able to handle it but there was no way to stop, everything was on point.
The starters to whet your appetite, a delight. The rice was just in quantity and with a background flavor that gave it the point.
I had never tasted fish like this before and from now on, I am going to order it. It was exquisite and the sauce was very tasty.
The meat surprises in its presentation but the flavor that could have been complex, has turned out to be quite the opposite, soft, each part detectable and when it was mixed in the mouth with the sauce, it did not want to go down to the stomach.
It is always easy to talk about desserts, but it is so imaginative to name them that, of course, more than one of us would have repeated them not once, but several times.
Thank you for your subsequent attention at the table.
Thank you for giving us a perfect day in our lives, the kids have done great, both those in the dining room and those in the kitchen, and we congratulate both of them.
You won't miss more visits, no."
ChIJSU2_kAgoQg0RgEd6jj1vRBs,5,"It's nice to see how the school students are attentive to your table at all times, with great service. It's the second time I've gone and I love knowing that with our presence, you are helping new generations of chefs and cooks. The food is very acceptable and the menu is economical. They have two menus: one for ‚Ç¨10 and another for ‚Ç¨20, drinks apart.
Advisable."
ChIJp68HL4YnQg0RaTj7S_Q1kb4,5,"The treatment is excellent, always with respect and they seek to serve as soon as possible to avoid waiting, despite having a lot of customers every day. The products, excellent is an understatement. I always order a sandwich for work and to be honest, it's one of the best I've had in a long time. I recommend stopping by to buy for any occasion."
ChIJp68HL4YnQg0RaTj7S_Q1kb4,5,"The sandwiches are incredible, they are ‚Ç¨2, they are of very good quality and a very good quantity, I totally recommend them."
ChIJp68HL4YnQg0RaTj7S_Q1kb4,5,"Any comment left will be little. Brothers become family! My grandmother was a client, then my mother and now me.
Maximum attention, treatment, kindness and the best products in all of Madrid. If they don't have them, they find them and if they don't convince, they don't repeat them. They know quality, both in products and in humanity.
I always make custom orders, but when you go for them you always take something else and also a smile for the rest of the day.
Thanks for everything!!!
What a shame there are only 5 stars because they deserve a 10!!"
ChIJp68HL4YnQg0RaTj7S_Q1kb4,5,Amazing neighborhood deli. They have all kinds of goods at good prices and great quality. There are even queues forming in the street. The best!
ChIJp68HL4YnQg0RaTj7S_Q1kb4,5,"A gem of ham! As a tourist, I found myself lost among the different hams and cheeses, but the attention and kindness of the young brothers was exceptional. Not only did they help us choose the perfect products, but they also provided detailed instructions to ensure an exceptional experience at home. The atmosphere is simply lovely; The friendliness of the staff creates an enveloping and welcoming atmosphere that makes you want to enjoy some good tapas and a coffee or a beer with them and the rest of the diners. It's been a long time since I felt so well cared for in a store. I recommend the place for the exquisite products as well as the experience, magnificent! Thank you, Marco brothers, for the excellent service."

ChIJbyIf0P0nQg0RBSO6kcB2ZRs,4,"Good breakfast for 3'60, being able to choose between pastries, montadito or tortilla skewer. The Tortilla, not very to my taste, but delicious, you know, tortillas are a world apart..."
ChIJbyIf0P0nQg0RBSO6kcB2ZRs,3,"Very good prices. The service could improve, especially the friendliness. They could also play some music, radio or similar, it is rare to have breakfast or have something in complete silence."
ChIJbyIf0P0nQg0RBSO6kcB2ZRs,5,Varied and homemade food. You eat very well and on top of that cheap. Good treatment by both waiters. I would always repeat.
ChIJbyIf0P0nQg0RBSO6kcB2ZRs,5,"The typical neighborhood cafeteria has been serving and always good for twenty years.
Luis and Herminio as well as two excellent, professional and great people
Good breakfasts, excellent menu of the day, with fresh, homemade cuisine and the best, tapas with the neighborhood drink
Highly recommended"

We arrived with our luggage, having come straight from the train station, but the owner went out of his way to adjust the seating and ensure we had enough space, which was very thoughtful of him.
Their menu del d√≠a had a great selection of dishes, and everything we tried was delicious. My family, visiting from abroad, was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.
This restaurant's success and great reviews are well deserved ‚Äî the food is fantastic, and the team truly goes above and beyond to serve their customers.
Muchas gracias!"

The place is cosy yet not cramped, making it easy for you to feel secure, safe, and watched by the staff who are prepared to make your experience here the best. For my second course my waited swapped my knife because it would be easier to cut, and I am forever grateful for that. They're friendly and will treat you like an old school friend (‚Å†‚óç‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†·¥ó‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†‚óç‚Å†)

The food here is also breath taking, as well as hunger taking. It's delicious, made perfectly, looks good and tastes even better. The menu is somewhat simple (if you know Spain and what it has to offer). Despite this the meals you'll get here are unique and as I keep on repeating, amazing. Even the fries are hand cut and cooked.

If you're looking at this review call in, make a reservation, and get here on time. You'll never regret it! (Just bring a Spanish speaker or Google translate)"
ChIJAejoyP0nQg0R_FF4frYmEa4,5,Amazing experience here. Food was delicious and the hosts were very welcoming and helpful even though we know very little Spanish. Everything they recommend is wonderful! Can‚Äôt wait to come back üòç
ChIJAejoyP0nQg0R_FF4frYmEa4,5,"13‚Ç¨ for the whole menu, drinks included. The food's very delicious, the staff is friendly. Highly recommend!"

ChIJt8Bvwv0nQg0R9KwvgwOIciA,1,"I've got a food poisoning, careful. I've tried a few dishes, everything tasted bad. And it's rather expensive!"
ChIJt8Bvwv0nQg0R9KwvgwOIciA,5,Ok üëçüòèüòÅüòÅüòúüòò
ChIJt8Bvwv0nQg0R9KwvgwOIciA,4,Ok

VERY GOOD üëå SO MUCH QUALITY, QUANTITY, PRICE üëèüëèüëè CONGRATULATIONS"
ChIJt8Bvwv0nQg0R9KwvgwOIciA,4,"Homemade and delicious food. I would appreciate more vegan dishes, although the truth is that they always have beans and broccoli, but a little more variety would be great. Very friendly treatment."
ChIJ91i3rjEnQg0Ru39UwMjF2iU,1,Disgusting food. I felt sick afterwards
ChIJ91i3rjEnQg0Ru39UwMjF2iU,5,Amazing deals
ChIJ91i3rjEnQg0Ru39UwMjF2iU,4,"This taco bell is very comfortable, located very close to Alto de Extremadura, good service from the staff, it has a second floor and is always very clean! Advisable!!!"
ChIJ91i3rjEnQg0Ru39UwMjF2iU,5,"Excellent food and service, the boy at the cashier Maiki took great care of us, offered us all the combos and helped us complete the survey to get our free ice cream"
ChIJ91i3rjEnQg0Ru39UwMjF2iU,5,"An incredible experience from start to finish. The staff was impeccable, very attentive and friendly. The food, simply delicious: each dish full of flavor and perfectly presented. The atmosphere is cozy and elegant, ideal for both a special dinner and a casual outing. Without a doubt, I will return soon. Highly recommended!"
ChIJmTH64v0nQg0RhhrdnApBTo8,4,It's a good place to have breakfast if you are around the paseo Extremadura area. Coffee also good.
ChIJmTH64v0nQg0RhhrdnApBTo8,1,One of the dirtiest bars I've seen in a long time. Just filthy.
ChIJmTH64v0nQg0RhhrdnApBTo8,1,"Bar la Feria, and so much, a bar that works thanks to the outpatient clinic on Avenida de Portugal, passing by and that lives off of the poor patients who have finished undergoing tests and need to eat something with a coffee, breakfast that is not much, a coffee with milk and a bakery conch, 3.80 a nail and the sad thing is that they did not have the price posted anywhere, it is true that I could have asked for the complaint form, but for that money it is not worth it, I prefer to give them the gypsy curse hehe, in short, coffee for me tastes bad, it tastes a lot like roasted and conch from the old ones, pure and simple bakery, the service is correct but the friendly waitresses had nothing, they abuse what I said.."
ChIJmTH64v0nQg0RhhrdnApBTo8,4,"A bar that is located next to the country house fair. The food is good but they beat you with attention. A waitress alone but she is attentive all the time. Beyond serving a table. I was alone and a little lost not being from the city and I was waiting for transportation because she went outside to accompany me and see that I would be okay. That's priceless.
Their specialty is breakfast so stop by."
ChIJmTH64v0nQg0RhhrdnApBTo8,5,"Everything was perfect, they were served in less than 5 minutes, the staff was friendly and was always looking out for you, the food was delicious and the price was very affordable for Madrid, 11 euros if I remember correctly. Without a doubt, I would repeat."
ChIJm_4FqvQnQg0RxVR-CXsWccM,5,"Always fresh fries, always kind workers, and always fast service. Simply the best McDonald‚Äôs!"
ChIJm_4FqvQnQg0RxVR-CXsWccM,1,"Ordered for take away, by the time i got home i noticed that there was no sauce on the mcflurrys. How is that even possible."
ChIJm_4FqvQnQg0RxVR-CXsWccM,5,My first time eating McDonald in spain it was good

ChIJN9Vbov0nQg0R2paAGweegco,2,"Beers ok, but cheated on price (2 beers for 6,25 euro???)."
ChIJN9Vbov0nQg0R2paAGweegco,5,Ok
ChIJN9Vbov0nQg0R2paAGweegco,1,"Appearances can be deceiving, and if the dishes look good, they have nothing to do with reality, hence the saying.
Weekend menu (‚Ç¨20 p.p) with four starters, 4 seconds, bread, drink, dessert or coffee.
First we ordered the Eggplant.  Cold, hard and bathed (literally) in bottled tomato just as cold as the Eggplant.
For the second I chose the turkey thigh, and like the Eggplant, cold, hard and tasteless. It came with a side of raw and flabby French fries like the pich@ of an octogenarian. And the sauce, despite having a good flavor, being equally cold, did not even invite dipping bread.
My partner ordered the ribs and ended up sweating from the effort of cutting them with the knife (I'm not exaggerating)
Basic dessert despite being homemade. Since you offer cheesecake, unless it is oven-baked, do not fry it with royal gelatin. In the end. By not returning we have it covered."
ChIJN9Vbov0nQg0R2paAGweegco,5,"El Coto restaurant, hidden between Paseo de Extremadura and Calle de la Milagrosa in Madrid, is one of those well-kept secrets that lovers of good gastronomy must discover. This typical Madrid bar-restaurant captures the authentic essence of traditional cuisine with a touch of unsurpassed quality.

Our experience began with a fresh and vibrant salad, which announced the level of care that went into each dish. The octopus arrived at the table tender and full of flavor, a true delicacy. The chops, juicy and perfectly cooked, were another delicious surprise. But the real protagonist was the suckling pig: crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside and with that unmistakable flavor that can only be achieved with top-quality products.

To close the experience, the dessert was up to par, crowning an impeccable meal. The attention of the owner, a friendly and very attentive young man, made our visit even more special, making sure that every detail was perfect. Without a doubt, El Coto is a place that we enthusiastically recommend, and to which we are looking forward to returning."
ChIJN9Vbov0nQg0R2paAGweegco,5,"This restaurant has improved to excellence with the new manager: freshly cooked food, cleanliness, good service, enough variety... and popular prices. I sincerely recommend it"
ChIJKX9kIFUnQg0RTW-zvLS0iIw,1,"I just came to see the menu and check out the place, they immediately ask me, what I would like to eat at the 1 second, I answered that I need to time to check, and they answered me that If I not gonna buy pizza I should go out.
So from my point, firstly: You should to be polite with guests and give them some free + time to decide what they need and to check menu.

So never gonna back here. Bueee"
ChIJKX9kIFUnQg0RTW-zvLS0iIw,5,"Good pizza takeout.
Price point perfect, and pizza even better!"
ChIJKX9kIFUnQg0RTW-zvLS0iIw,5,"Pizza like it should be. Thin, good ingredients, perfectly baked. Not too oily, not too full of stuff on top. 10/10. Best pizza for the price in Madrid."
ChIJKX9kIFUnQg0RTW-zvLS0iIw,5,Amazing service. Tarek  is super friendly and always having a smile each time you walk in the place. The pizza is truly delicious and good value for money. Defo recommended!!
ChIJKX9kIFUnQg0RTW-zvLS0iIw,5,"Not only do I love tasty, cheap pizza and take away promotions, but when I called once to say I needed a pizza as soon as possible because we ate it during classes, I got it in +- 10-12 minutes ‚ù§Ô∏è

Tasty cake, fresh ingredients, I love it and recommend it"
ChIJLeBcxfwnQg0RC5qC15ONSvg,5,Been traveling through Europe this month and stumbled upon this local gem! Must try their veggie pizza. Worth the $!
ChIJLeBcxfwnQg0RC5qC15ONSvg,5,Tasty pizzas. I recommend bismark and the raffaello's one.
ChIJLeBcxfwnQg0RC5qC15ONSvg,4,"Very fast, crunchy and nice pizza"
ChIJLeBcxfwnQg0RC5qC15ONSvg,5,Great service
ChIJLeBcxfwnQg0RC5qC15ONSvg,5,Best Pizza in Madrid!
ChIJW6iYz_wnQg0R5ie7vVSKspo,2,"Make a big deal that I didn't have a reservation. Then sat me me at a table for 3. Shortly afterwards, a guy came and rudely told me that because I was a single diner and it was a 3 top, I had to immediately move. Shortly there after he sat a couple of 2. I ordered my dinner and waited and waited. Finally brought meal and salad at the same time. By the time I finished my salad my pasta was cold. Cold pasta is not very tasty. After they rewarmed my pasta, it was ok. Nothing that would encourage me to return. Far better restaurants in Madrid."
ChIJW6iYz_wnQg0R5ie7vVSKspo,5,Top class calamares.
ChIJW6iYz_wnQg0R5ie7vVSKspo,3,Good and cheap food
ChIJW6iYz_wnQg0R5ie7vVSKspo,5,Nice  place
ChIJW6iYz_wnQg0R5ie7vVSKspo,5,"Nice, comfortable, stylish :) and cozy place.
With friendly, close and super pleasant treatment.
Very good service and food
Whenever possible it is nice to come."
ChIJ1Rs8n_snQg0R9sUryonjKaw,3,"A very attractive space with very bad cuisine. A scarce quinoa and pumpkin risotto, salty and poorly prepared and some eggs with ham and potatoes that the ham did not deserve that name, the potatoes were very salty and the eggs were small in size.
The presentation to have a laugh."
ChIJ1Rs8n_snQg0R9sUryonjKaw,5,"Excellent service from the girls, new management, very kind and attentive. Super promotions and Maria, wonderful. Thank you very much for your services."
ChIJ1Rs8n_snQg0R9sUryonjKaw,4,"It's lost a lot since the change of ownership. I don't like paying for tortillas from the day before, if there's any left over, they give it as an appetizer."
ChIJ1Rs8n_snQg0R9sUryonjKaw,4,"Various tapas and beers at a very good price
Fast service and friendly staff."
ChIJ1Rs8n_snQg0R9sUryonjKaw,5,"It has a fantastic terrace, a menu for ‚Ç¨11, burgers and portions"
ChIJadhCzvwnQg0RCMxVbcNnT0s,3,"It could have been better.
But I'll come back to try the rest of the menu"
ChIJadhCzvwnQg0RCMxVbcNnT0s,5,Nice place.
ChIJadhCzvwnQg0RCMxVbcNnT0s,5,"Hello!
Good treatment... What a nice waitress Maria!
Mmmm
How delicious... What a pro cook!
The place is charming and well set up.
Warmth for the cold day outside is appreciated...
They make you feel like you are at homeüòç
I repeat for sure!
We left super full"
ChIJadhCzvwnQg0RCMxVbcNnT0s,1,"I didn't like any of these dishes. The baked goods to take away for ‚Ç¨9 are very poor and the encebollado is pure oily fat on top and bad...... I ordered everything to take away and it's not worth it at all to have gone there from Tetouan... I mean it's all terrible.
I heard it on the radio and thought I was going to do as advertised but I don't recommend this place at all."
ChIJadhCzvwnQg0RCMxVbcNnT0s,5,"All delicious and exceptional treatment. I recommend it without a doubt. A very clean place, the food looks delicious and of quality. Finally I would like to highlight the good atmosphere and the music."
ChIJJVm8oQYnQg0RqeWxMTaVZec,5,
ChIJax1SCXUoQg0RDtq7D8AsUh8,1,"Incredibly rude staff. I had to wait 35 minutes before app showed its ready. The entire time the number was on the screen at pickup ""in preparation"". after 40 minutes i asked and they pulled out a brown bag with the order. had been ready for 40 minutes but never once they called the number. it was old and horrible food. the manager yelled at me ""chupamale"" and ""puta madre"" when i asked to get the fries redone. he didnt do it and threw the bag onto the counter. incredible, never ever saw something this horrendous..."
ChIJax1SCXUoQg0RDtq7D8AsUh8,1,"Probably the worst Burger King in Madrid. Collapsed service, cold burgers, super rude manager. Don't waste your time here."
ChIJax1SCXUoQg0RDtq7D8AsUh8,5,"They v√©g√©tarian option, not all th√© places offers it"
ChIJax1SCXUoQg0RDtq7D8AsUh8,1,Fast food is a title that should not be associated with this establishment. Staff seem confused and don't prioritise customers in the restaurant. There is no order to the orders and the display board doesn't show which order is ready. Altogether a pretty poor experience and not what you would expect from a well known chain.
ChIJax1SCXUoQg0RDtq7D8AsUh8,5,"I'd like to apologize to the staff who worked on the night of 17th November 2015, who had to clean up my puke after drinking too much at a nearby concert. Once the pandemic is over, I'd love to go back and have a proper meal."
ChIJHbCFQeQnQg0RPK-lHA3POZo,4,In general good a good kebab and friendly working staff.
ChIJHbCFQeQnQg0RPK-lHA3POZo,4,It‚Äôs fine according to √°rea.
ChIJHbCFQeQnQg0RPK-lHA3POZo,5,"Wonderful owner, we came in late convinced him to cook us some chicken and they were closing in 10 minutes....and to top is all off, the food was delicious"
ChIJHbCFQeQnQg0RPK-lHA3POZo,5,"A great place to eat and relax with s great selection of meal deals, drinks served by friendly and courteous staff at reasonable prices. A great place with a great local feel to it."
ChIJHbCFQeQnQg0RPK-lHA3POZo,1,Forgot to provide the rice with the chicken meal. Also extra portion of rice I ordered was tiny.
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RTH6SsYmrSMk,5,"A perfect Spanish Barrio along the river and away, but walkable, from the main Placa in town. We found this mercado with a great mix of selling top produce of meat and vegetables to taking some great vinos, tapas and beers. The atmosphere is brilliant. Don‚Äôt miss it."
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RTH6SsYmrSMk,5,this is such a cool market in Madrid. it is off the beaten path a little bit. mostly locals. great food. great produce and meats. go enjoy. feel like a local.
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RTH6SsYmrSMk,5,Small but nice market with great drink and tapas options. The rice spot has wonderful paellas.
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RTH6SsYmrSMk,5,"Had a really good seafood paella & a cinnamon torrija with caramel ice cream that was delicious!!!!! The place was for locals, no tourists ü§ç"
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RTH6SsYmrSMk,5,"Always busy, but has some of the nicest places to drink and eat. Worth a visit!!"
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RmYYC5kO3vK4,5,"Nice food, friendly staff

Had the very good Mexican style ceviche.
Great!"
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RmYYC5kO3vK4,3,"Vegicano isn't 100% vegan or 100% mexican,
They have options and the mexican food is more like re interpretation."
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RmYYC5kO3vK4,3,The dessert was great apart from that it was just fine
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RmYYC5kO3vK4,5,Amazon food even better service. I go to place when I want sth close from home and good veggie food.
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RmYYC5kO3vK4,5,Great!!
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RAwTbfYHpFuk,5,EXCELLENT FOOD AND VIBES
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RAwTbfYHpFuk,5,"Highly recommended, great service, good recommendations, delicious food."
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RAwTbfYHpFuk,5,"It's all very good. The tacos and the Korean sandwich are 10. If you like spicy, I 100% recommend their homemade sauce! There is a lot of atmosphere, they have a variety of beers and they serve you super fast. Furthermore, the entire team is very friendly. And I love veggie options üå±.
I'll be back!"
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RAwTbfYHpFuk,1,"The food is good, but they do not allow you to bring drinks from other establishments in the market, such as a Duchess of Burgundy, a delicious beer that they only serve as normal in the craft brewery."
ChIJ3-iGYwooQg0RAwTbfYHpFuk,5,"Sure hit. Classics for the faithful such as guacamolejo or curries, flashy additions such as the new sandwiches, wines and beers with discretion, great service... Enjoy it."
ChIJ6Rx76gooQg0RRoWvJhI2brQ,5,Had a cold glass of Ladron de verano here after touring the city it was so delicious! I definitely want to go here again. They have wonderful views.
ChIJ6Rx76gooQg0RRoWvJhI2brQ,3,"A casual place in an awesome city.
Food is ok, tapas are good.
portions and prices are fair.
The place is busy because of tourism in summer."
ChIJ6Rx76gooQg0RRoWvJhI2brQ,5,"100 montaditos is my favorite place to eat at on Sunday‚Äôs and Wednesday‚Äôs. Brunch time here is not too crowded, but get here around 12 for short lines and good seating options. I definitely recommend this place to foreigners visiting Madrid for the first time!"
ChIJ6Rx76gooQg0RRoWvJhI2brQ,5,"Fast food chain, food is ok, standard pub fare.  Wed and Sunday their entire menu is 1 euro items.  But the best thing here, and the main reason we'll return as often as possible, is the big 500ml mugs of beer or tinto verano for the unbeatable price of just 2 euro!  As far as we can tell most of the patrons come here for the cheap beer.  They probably pump more from their taps then any other place I've been in Spain."
ChIJ6Rx76gooQg0RRoWvJhI2brQ,5,Nothing beats a cold drink at a hot summer day. But at this location aware of the birds in the trees. They might mess up your meal. ü§£
ChIJQ8iOoHUoQg0RQRN0ZcPC51A,1,"After 40min waiting our plates look empty. Horrible service.

Edit: food just arrived and my sandwich's taste is like fish but it contains chicken meat. I found a hair in my food too. I want to get out of here as soon as possible. The best part of my dinner is my coke."
ChIJQ8iOoHUoQg0RQRN0ZcPC51A,1,"Avoid at all costs!! Cortado 3,50‚Ç¨ wth???"
ChIJQ8iOoHUoQg0RQRN0ZcPC51A,2,"The croissant was a flat, thin piece of... something. The tortilla was not tasty at all - the potato was a little too raw, the ""egg"" (clearly not fresh eggs) tasted a bit acid (maybe due to the o√≠l you are using) and it was not properly cooked... Well not an expert but I can say I didn't like it at all. The waiter was not rude to us, but she was to other customers. Not the behaviour expected from a waiter. Will not go again, sorry but you have got a lot to work on to save this place. Good luck"
ChIJQ8iOoHUoQg0RQRN0ZcPC51A,1,"Disgusting! An absolute disgrace to Spanish food! My boyfriend and I ended up here after the restaurant we tried to go to was randomly closed, so we started walking around looking for another restaurant and somehow ended up in the dead zone where this restaurant is located. I could tell from the outside that this place was horrible, but my boyfriend was getting desperate so we decided to go in and give it a try. We ordered the Croquettes, Shrimp Scampi and the Entrocte, all were horrendous! The croquettes were crispy on the outside, and grey and mushy on the inside. The shrimp scampi smelled so fishy, I bravely took a tiny bite of one shrimp and nearly spit it out! They're clearly frozen and appalling! My boyfriend's Entrocte came out WAY after my Shrimp Scampi and we were dying to leave by the time it arrived. Needless to say, it was awful! We took one bite and asked for the check. The server was surprised to see we wanted to leave without touching our food, and we were trying to be polite but after a bit he could tell we didn't like the food. He felt sorry for us and gave us each a shot, but I left there worried I was going to get sick from that food. I felt nauseous the rest of the night.

Stay far away from this place, I'm sick just thinking about it! The worst food we had in 3 weeks in Europe üò´"
ChIJQ8iOoHUoQg0RQRN0ZcPC51A,3,"A good find, walking back from Madrid centre to our apartment.  Delicious tapas / raciones and the Albari√±o white wine was a perfect accompaniment."
ChIJw9JhVAooQg0RdvdAkjxkgjk,1,"This was probably the worst dining experience i have had in my life. The food was of extremely low quality and none of the 4 diners at my table could physically bring themselves to eat It. The waiter was agressive when we commented that It wasnt an enjoyable experience . From the variety of items on the men√∫ del d√≠a to choose from , It seems this restaurant in serving Up the scraps they Locate in the dumpsters at night behind the market.. and coming Up with poor versions of spanish favourites. A truly regrettable experience... And a complete waste of money. Reading the other comments later after leaving the restaurant i cant help but agree with the review which summed Up the experience as a feeling of being cheated."
ChIJw9JhVAooQg0RdvdAkjxkgjk,5,"Typical southern Spanish food served by an truly friendly waiter, he treated us like family, bringing a nice soup and chocolates on the house. An authentic Spanish place :)."
ChIJw9JhVAooQg0RdvdAkjxkgjk,5,Great place! Nice andaluz restaurant with friendly and good service
ChIJw9JhVAooQg0RdvdAkjxkgjk,4,Seafood from a southern point of view. This is a wonderful spot for evening tapas on their terraza.
ChIJw9JhVAooQg0RdvdAkjxkgjk,4,Quite nice special fry calamars yummy yummy
ChIJR9qFSw8oQg0R9xWMcCVl4E4,1,"The environment is great since you can eat outside near the lake if the temperature is good. The staff otherwise is not as nice, one of them was cool but the rest are not. The food not really good either... by the way, be aware 1l beer jar is 13 euros!!! We had to ask four times for the bill and at the end it had many errors in the drinks and in the amount of food we ordered... Not a serious place, not recommendable..."
ChIJR9qFSw8oQg0R9xWMcCVl4E4,4,The meat is fantastic! The tortilla and fried calamari are good too. The price is reasonable but the service was not the best. Tips: Go before 2pm. It‚Äôs super crowded after.
ChIJR9qFSw8oQg0R9xWMcCVl4E4,3,"Food can be better.  Wonderful view! We weren't happy they charged us twice for a dish, so be cautious when paying if you're speaking English."
ChIJR9qFSw8oQg0R9xWMcCVl4E4,5,"Such a beautiful place to celebrate our beloved Roberto‚Äôs 50th birthday! The landscape is stunning, the air and breeze fresh even on the hottest day, and the staff is absolutely wonderful. A great place to enjoy a quiet sunset or a celebration!"
ChIJR9qFSw8oQg0R9xWMcCVl4E4,4,"Good place for lunch but not when it‚Äôs +36 ü§™

Also the menu del dia is more humble in summer time

But views are still good üòä"
ChIJPeV0nP0nQg0RjJI15N2lklw,3,"I ordered a gluten free pizza for pick up online. My pizza was prepared quickly and available at the time sent to me. The store was clean and staff were very friendly. This is my first time ordering a gluten free pizza from Telepizza, and it will be my last. I appreciate that the pizza came sealed with an allergen label, was cooked in a protective wrapper, and was not cut. It appears that Telepizza takes cross contamination very seriously. However, the gluten free pizza crust used is hands down the worst GF pizza crust I have  ever eaten. It was Luke warm, crumbly, and strangely dry and too wet at the same time. The toppings tasted fine. I would recommend seeking out a new vendor for crusts."
ChIJPeV0nP0nQg0RjJI15N2lklw,2,"Ordered fries and two drinks when the place was busy and sat down to chat. Waited twenty five minutes before we got even the drinks. The box of fries was more than 3‚Ç¨ and so small.  When in Spain, stick with the bars and caf√©s."
ChIJPeV0nP0nQg0RjJI15N2lklw,4,"Good pizza - surprisingly, especially given the food options around here. They had a special for 3 medium pizzas for 7 Euros each which was a good deal. Service could have been a bit more accommodating but everything worked out."
ChIJPeV0nP0nQg0RjJI15N2lklw,1,In order to go and eat in a restaurant you have to have staff who serve the customers.  This place doesnt have any staff who can serve the customers. Therefore this place does not get a good rating.  However I was not able to order anything so I cannot critique the food.  But the service is terrible and the restaurant looks like there was a party there and no one cleaned up yet.
ChIJPeV0nP0nQg0RjJI15N2lklw,3,We ate glutan free pizza. It is fine the dough was bit hard in few. Overall it is ok
ChIJj3B2oQkoQg0R55qWg_cnKnA,5,"A taste of the authentic Spanish tapas. If you want to live the original Spanish experience then this is your place. The staff were very kind and helpful and they served us a plate of paella on the house. Highly recommended, especially if you were roaming around Casa de Campo and want to sit somewhere nice!"
ChIJj3B2oQkoQg0R55qWg_cnKnA,5,Very good food and very kind waiters! They gave us paella as a tapa free of charge for ordering something to drink!
ChIJj3B2oQkoQg0R55qWg_cnKnA,4,Good Spanish food. I had good dishes from daily menu.
ChIJj3B2oQkoQg0R55qWg_cnKnA,5,"The location of this restaurant is amazing and unique, perched just atop a little island in Bayona. We ordered vegetable and sardine salad, octopus, galician stew (caldo gallego), and lobster rice. Everything was well done, although the rice was not as good as we've had in many places in Spain."
ChIJj3B2oQkoQg0R55qWg_cnKnA,5,"Great place, great service nice people. You can eat everything and drink."
ChIJ1UUxNOcnQg0Rk_eL5xnDwb8,1,"In the last months, every time we've had Burger King, in several different locations, we have been disappointed. We've decided to give it a rest for a year at least.
Misleading information in the touchscreens, reheated meat in the burgers, dirty floors and dirtier restrooms; some in the staff are polite and helpful, others are flat-out rude. No amount of free-refill can make up for that."
ChIJ1UUxNOcnQg0Rk_eL5xnDwb8,5,"They offers a v√©g√©tarian option, not all places offers it"
ChIJ1UUxNOcnQg0Rk_eL5xnDwb8,5,Ok
ChIJ1UUxNOcnQg0Rk_eL5xnDwb8,3,"Think twice when there's lot of people, is anything but fast food, no matter how hard they try, it needs more personnel. Lots of options around, and price is almost the same."
ChIJ1UUxNOcnQg0Rk_eL5xnDwb8,5,"Great workers, very good characters nice service."
ChIJ-4iZS98nQg0R_FehI9x0Y9w,3,"No english spoken at all sadly. Only one option of vegetarian sushi and other kind of foods. The sushi was good, the rest not that great. The service wasn‚Äôt that friendly seemed annoyed by every question‚Ä¶ overall wouldn‚Äôt go again."
ChIJ-4iZS98nQg0R_FehI9x0Y9w,5,We were there in the evening and payed under 50‚Ç¨ for two people with two drinks each. The food came very fast and was amazing. Fantastic concept with the menu. If we‚Äôre in Madrid again we‚Äôll definitely come again. üëçüèª
ChIJ-4iZS98nQg0R_FehI9x0Y9w,5,"Best sushi in Madrid!
I tried quite a lot of places and this has the best taste among all I tried. The price - I think we don‚Äôt need to talk about that in detail ;)
I suggest the eel sushi !!!!"
ChIJ-4iZS98nQg0R_FehI9x0Y9w,1,"The picture clearly shows what you get when you go for cheap food! Was unlucky to visit with friends who wanted to try... Japanese restaurant owned by Chinese people. Cheap and low quality fish served to those who are looking for a cheap eat. The reason why there are so many good reviews is a raffle advertised on restaurant! Avoid, avoid and avoid or go and try at your own risk!"
ChIJ-4iZS98nQg0R_FehI9x0Y9w,1,"I'm not the type to write bad reviews about restaurants but I think there is a first time for everything.

I came here to dine with my best friend because this place is an all-you-can-eat buffet. We ordered a variety of dishes and while the food was basic tasting, the service was one of the worst I have experienced in a while now.

We were publicly mocked by the waiters here. The oldest server here, the one with round glasses, short of stature started the mocking by pointing fingers at us from a distance. All the waiters joined her, thinking they were discreet.

Each time they passed by our table they would ask if we wanted anything more to eat while visbly mocking us. Either letting out a chuckle or sharing ""amused"" glances between themselves.

When we asked for the bill, the oldest waiter jokingly asked us again if we don't want anything more to eat. Also, when I have asked her for a glass of water she refused to bring me one.

All in all, a terrible experience. A place where they don't respect neither their customers or the food they make."
ChIJb47NyeMnQg0RkZwvcd0mcPE,1,Refused to deal with foreigners even though we tried asking to order food in spanish
ChIJb47NyeMnQg0RkZwvcd0mcPE,5,"Beautiful place with lovely people,  made feel very welcome üòä"
ChIJb47NyeMnQg0RkZwvcd0mcPE,5,"Lovely place, lovely terrace with a view of the park and very nice, polite, helpful people. Gourmande tasty breakfasts!"
ChIJb47NyeMnQg0RkZwvcd0mcPE,3,"I'm giving 3 stars temporally, because the waiter was working like it was it's first day... Too many time asking, wrong drinks etc...."
ChIJb47NyeMnQg0RkZwvcd0mcPE,3,The bar needs deep cleaning but food is very fresh and staff pretty relaxed.
ChIJg0xdIeInQg0R8SLAzbaBfCc,5,"Wow this place is really nice! The fabada was delicious and I got lunch for 10¬£ that included a started , main meal and dessert( the flan is homemade and very tasty!) the owner was very nice and hospitable. A nice local place to eat in Madrid!"

ChIJUwqYsnqHZUARX7q8sWYmZ10,5,Pedro (the owner) is a lovely guy. He always serves well and is very polite. They put good tapas with the drink. There is a good atmosphere. And the menu of the day is highly recommended. The best in the neighborhood
ChIJUwqYsnqHZUARX7q8sWYmZ10,5,"Excellent Service, exquisite seasoning, good atmosphere, excellent space."
ChIJCbIVBeMnQg0R4_9gOhcmTXI,5,"We have eaten some hamburgers, very delicious! The treatment was great, it was already very late and they treated us as if it were first thing in the morning. Also, a homeless person came up and they gave them a bag of freshly made cold feet and not everyone does that."
ChIJCbIVBeMnQg0R4_9gOhcmTXI,5,Good burgers and very friendly. I will return to take some empanadas that I saw that looked very good.
ChIJCbIVBeMnQg0R4_9gOhcmTXI,1,"I called to ask for information about the food, yes, there was service and everyone hung up on me, very bad service."

ChIJp9yKiuInQg0Rp8a7y_okdzY,5,Great
ChIJp9yKiuInQg0Rp8a7y_okdzY,5,The tapas with each drink are amazing. Traditional portions and neighborhood atmosphere.
ChIJp9yKiuInQg0Rp8a7y_okdzY,5,"Good old bar, with its tapas, its gentlemen, its conversations and its laughter. Pure Madrid of which there is no more. üòÉ Mois√©s is the best, how wonderful to spend some time there üòä"
ChIJp9yKiuInQg0Rp8a7y_okdzY,5,"Deluxe. Antonio was a phenomenon and Mois√©s is not far behind.
Very good bar to drink with delicious tapas. The kitchen dishes are delicious.
Neighborhood atmosphere."
ChIJ8SuUBvInQg0RPQn1GnqESu4,5,"Got the burgers and fries and it was so so good. Really good flavor, portions and price. The owner Ram√≥n was very welcoming and kind. All of the other food also looked really good - definitely want to stop here again next time I'm in Madrid!"
ChIJ8SuUBvInQg0RPQn1GnqESu4,5,"We got hamburgers and fries. We also got croquetas for an appetizer. Both were cooked to perfection and were large portions at a great price. Ram√≥n, the owner and chef, was extremely hospitable even though we couldn‚Äôt speak much Spanish. Everyone needs to grab a burger here!!"
ChIJ8SuUBvInQg0RPQn1GnqESu4,5,Excellent üòäüòäüòä
ChIJ8SuUBvInQg0RPQn1GnqESu4,5,"A place that does not attract attention at first sight, but is run by Ram√≥n, a great guy concerned about offering different things in the neighborhood. Vegan options, but also meat options, as well as different typical Paraguayan dishes. We must support these small businesses that come to bring diversity to the neighbors. The more options there are, the better the neighborhood will be. I have it saved in my Top. Highly recommended."
ChIJ8SuUBvInQg0RPQn1GnqESu4,5,"Ram√≥n makes some very juicy burgers. And a Paraguayan tortilla with a lot of flavor and good texture.
Juicy and tasty meat, and a simple but very delicious burger, with the potatoes just right.
He is a very kind man and he likes people to be comfortable."
ChIJQ21niuInQg0RmK3NEhgqu-8,5,"The menu del dia is excellent! ‚Ç¨10 for delicious 2 dishes with drink and desserts included. The ceviche is very tasty and fresh, the chicharr√≥nes are amazing too. Staff are friendly and attentive."
ChIJQ21niuInQg0RmK3NEhgqu-8,5,"Nice place with very nice stuff.
Even if you don't speak Spanish not a problem."
ChIJQ21niuInQg0RmK3NEhgqu-8,4,"The portions are HUGE. Highly recommend the chicken and the ceviche. The staff was very friendly as well! Giving this four stars because while I liked the homey-ness of the place, it was a little bit too tight especially since we were eating with our slightly rowdy little toddler."
ChIJQ21niuInQg0RmK3NEhgqu-8,2,"It is a Peruvian restaurant near by Purta de Anjel or Extramaduru metro stations. I wass here with my few friends and we tried Sangria but that was totally bad like sugar with water and having some chopped Apples, second one I tried a dish with a little sweet gravy potatoes and egg slice and I liked it, and really only this one I liked here. Guy's was good , they served well . But few of my friends was unable to eat there dishes because of taste was totally bad, but still you can't skip if you have ordered something."
ChIJQ21niuInQg0RmK3NEhgqu-8,3,"Sadly it just doesn‚Äôt make a cut for a repeating experience.
It‚Äôs summer and I called without answer 3 times before I went to make sure they had the soup available stated in their menu
On arrival they confirmed there is not available and they have different soups available which we took given the trip made
It took about 25min until soups were served and the fishy soup was smelling questionable and the second soup was alright. They reminded us that there were 5min until closing to speed our eating which it‚Äôs a bit I condescending.
Lastly before leaving I came to the apparent owner and asked for a phone number that works so next time I could ask and she answered that they phone number is correct and I should have called more than once (which I did) and asked if I called during working hours which I did and shown then she follows to respond preposterously that she‚Äôs way too busy to answer then. I explained it would be useful to make sure on a call before hand if the soup I wanted was available to what she says ‚Äúall in the menu is available‚Äù. Then less sorry I answered that‚Äôs not true given what happened and she interrupted to ask me where am I from, gave me a card and said goodbye.
Basically don‚Äôt expect a professional service, lower your standards and it would be quite alright"
ChIJ2ZptYLYnQg0RjWF0rWPfq4c,5,"delicious and authentic chinese food, not the usual touristic dishes.
Top quality for a very convenient price.
super recommended!"
ChIJ2ZptYLYnQg0RjWF0rWPfq4c,5,"Freshly made food, great quality, spacious and very friendly owners. Had a great time dining there, nothing fancy, but the food is great."
ChIJ2ZptYLYnQg0RjWF0rWPfq4c,5,Amazing food and service! Probably the best Chinese food we‚Äôve ever had.
ChIJ2ZptYLYnQg0RjWF0rWPfq4c,5,Very good food and staff! Can only recommend :)
ChIJ2ZptYLYnQg0RjWF0rWPfq4c,5,Very tasty food
ChIJKQWjE-InQg0RIF3ixSo-I3o,1,"We booked through the Fork to collect points and have some vegetarian food. Once arrived at the restaurant, we were told they had no main vegetarian courses (3 on the menu though) and offered empanadas. My friend had a classic burger (decent) and I was never served the empanadas. There were only 2 tables and 1 waiter, but he didn‚Äôt realise I never got my dish. They tried to charge for the empanadas too, which they then removed. They cancelled our booking on The Fork as well, so we never received the points and couldn‚Äôt leave a feedback on the app. Not reccomended."
ChIJKQWjE-InQg0RIF3ixSo-I3o,5,"Found it by chance and had a late lunch with a burger, beer and chocolate cake. The burger was wonderful and I'm happy with the service received. I recommend it."
ChIJKQWjE-InQg0RIF3ixSo-I3o,5,"Although they're famous because of their burgers, we came for brunch. They include a vegan option, and they serve fruit, cereals, juice... the toast with tomato, avocado and basil is a MUST.
Special mention to the kindness of the waitress, she made us feel so welcome!
And also... support local business, you know. üòâ"
ChIJKQWjE-InQg0RIF3ixSo-I3o,5,"Great burgers, really nice service, and a couple of perks that make the place stand out: dogs are allowed (I am not a dog owner, but very happy to be surrounded by them), and I asked for a glass of water and I've been served a glass of water (no ifs, no buts, as it happens often in Madrid). It's not a very large place, so if you don't like too much noise, go for an early lunch/dinner."
ChIJKQWjE-InQg0RIF3ixSo-I3o,1,Say it was open. And arrived and it‚Äôs closed‚Ä¶ just walked 20 min for nothing
ChIJqTnVi-InQg0R2mXc7G0fG1M,4,Peruvian food with friendly staff! Huge portioning of food with lovely salsa as background music. Typical Peruvian beer can also be found here (Cusque√±a) Menu Del d√≠a is definitely worth coming for!
ChIJqTnVi-InQg0R2mXc7G0fG1M,1,"We were dying of hunger and we entered the first place we saw, I understand if the food is being sold, it is for eating, they are not giving us a free offer, we bought the offer of 2 chickens and the chicken was green on the inside and black on the outside. I DO NOT RECOMMEND LOOKING FOR ANOTHER SITE even if they are dying, I will have to know how they prepare it and seeing the comments of other people, atrocities that are found, our mistake, not seeing the comments on this site.."
ChIJqTnVi-InQg0R2mXc7G0fG1M,1,"Bad service and unhygienic. My mother ordered a menu, less than 30 minutes ago, the first dish was normal, the second which was a fish had a fried spoonful on the side of the head. We don't have photos of the cockroach, because as soon as we told the waitress, she took the plate and went to the kitchen. When he returned he brought us the dataphone to charge us for the first dish. He didn't tell us anything, and seeing his little initiative or solution to this situation (which I don't see any, although an apology wouldn't hurt) he proceeded to say that since it is a food restaurant, healthiness would have to come first. It has never happened to us and we didn't know how to act, we paid for the first dish, although I don't agree. Who assures me that the soup was not contaminated. A disgusting situation. I would never return to this restaurant.
We didn't want to make a scandal because the shame came first for us.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL UNTIL THERE IS A HEALTH INSPECTION
I have the payment receipt because I made it with a card.
It is not a comment to damage the premises on the contrary so that they be careful and make sure that after this they have requested an inspection."
ChIJqTnVi-InQg0R2mXc7G0fG1M,5,"We bought 2/4 of chicken, it was very good, the service was 10... sometimes a smile is very pleasant for customers compared to other restaurants... üòÅ

ChIJC7KrfOInQg0RzPnZZZEb4_4,3,"Good tapas, good morcilla, super nice waiters (they are not Spanish) but what is missing is the real Spanish bar atmosphere.. it is something that you cannot describe but that you feel when you enter‚Ä¶ that missing vibe is the reason why I gave 3/5 to the bar."
ChIJC7KrfOInQg0RzPnZZZEb4_4,5,The super friendly staff was amazing and really hard working.  The food was top notch and affordable.

ChIJu_8Tn_wpQg0Rkg_EyxSXRjs,2,Food was ok my fry plantain didn‚Äôt feel fresh. I feel my salad was a little to expensive for tomate raw onions and avocado on top (avocado salad ). Good beer and good view of the city.

Will come back if I am in the area."
ChIJu_8Tn_wpQg0Rkg_EyxSXRjs,5,"Delicious food and decent prices. Recommend the Grevensteiner, the empanadas and Patacon relleno. Patio is a bit noisy because of the traffic but it‚Äôs a nice view. Server speaks Spanish but is able to make it understandable with gesturing. Menu is in Spanish and English."
ChIJu_8Tn_wpQg0Rkg_EyxSXRjs,5,Delicious colombian food! Good location and view.
ChIJu_8Tn_wpQg0Rkg_EyxSXRjs,5,"The food was amazing! Bandeja Paisa & the empanadas were superb!  A+
The restaurant is small (two tables) but the service and the owner provided a really nice atmosphere. I highly recommend this place if you are ever near the neighborhood of La Latina."
ChIJ-9C2FQQnQg0Rzy5QlbXWIlQ,1,"Bad, very bad attention. I asked for food, the girl told me to come by at my time, I went after 40 minutes and she didn't have anything prepared, she acted like she had never seen me. Of shame. Besides, there was a character with the music on his cell phone so loud that he couldn't even be there and he was allowed to disturb it. Better not even enter"
ChIJ-9C2FQQnQg0Rzy5QlbXWIlQ,5,"CRAZYLY: GREAT PLACE, JUST VERY GOOD WISHES AND MANY BLESSINGS, THIS NEIGHBORHOOD NEEDS THIS PERSON, SO BEAUTIFUL, ONLY GOOD WORDS.
I LOVE YOU."

ChIJZ6cfF9gnQg0RkgGleMlGjso,5,"Delicious pizza, the pistachio one was great with red wine."
ChIJZ6cfF9gnQg0RkgGleMlGjso,5,"The pizza used to be 5 star quality,  but now the price has increased and the ingredients has changed to the worse.

As an example:
I used to love the olives that they put on the diavola, but now they have changed them with onion?? And there were no longer fresh basil."
ChIJZ6cfF9gnQg0RkgGleMlGjso,5,"Absolutely in love with the dough! Way ahead in the famous Italian restaurants list here in Madrid!

ChIJfVpt1CYnQg0R7YLJKMDTM_c,5,"EXCELLENT, one of the places where the attention is the one that no longer remains. Roc√≠o is wonderful, in a short time she has connected with all the regular clients. It makes you feel at home. Attentive, happy, willing, fast. Always with a smile. Good people!! Very fast service and delicious dishes. Value for money of 10!"
ChIJfVpt1CYnQg0R7YLJKMDTM_c,2,"Things go out of time. No variety of desserts. You have to ask them for things like four times. The only one worth it, the girl who is working on the terrace. The truth is that it is very fast and efficient. In short, I will not return. Not recommended"
ChIJfVpt1CYnQg0R7YLJKMDTM_c,5,"Good experience!
The food is worth repeating, the presentation of the dishes is very cool, the staff is very friendly, good vibes, it is great on the terrace.

ChIJbVX2iRgpQg0RJXFRmlEHA8U,5,"Everything is great! We came to this place by pure chance and it was a complete success.
The owners are super friendly and attentive, they explained and recommended the dishes to us.
We ordered two portions, 4 beers and 2 bottles of water, all for ‚Ç¨25.
I would return without a doubt."
ChIJRZiZAQooQg0RuEPDDKfjfc4,2,Ohh
ChIJRZiZAQooQg0RuEPDDKfjfc4,1,"Terrible food. I asked on the website requesting that they not put onion in the spaghetti, they put half a kilo. to the trash
Rice with beef is a three-delight rice with pieces of beef, surely leftovers from days gone by.
The spring roll, half burnt.
‚Ç¨14 in the trash.
I have requested a refund for the spaghetti dish."
ChIJRZiZAQooQg0RuEPDDKfjfc4,1,"ROTTEN FOOD!! DO NOT ASK
Read the rest of the reviews....
We ordered delivery for 7 people, 2 of them vomiting after 2 hours and the other 3 with diarrhea, if you want to lose weight this is your place, yes, prepare paper, double layer if possible.
We called to tell him that the noodles and sweet and sour pork are rotten, he tells us literally...""noodles yes, but pork no, impossible.""
I hope health does its job and stops by."
ChIJRZiZAQooQg0RuEPDDKfjfc4,5,"Both when eating in the restaurant and when ordering at home, the quality of the food and service is very good.

The products are fresh, tasty and the staff helps you a lot when choosing in case you don't have much of an idea.

Delivery takes little time and the food arrives hot and in good condition."
ChIJRZiZAQooQg0RuEPDDKfjfc4,5,"Today was the first time we have ordered food from this restaurant and it really was a 10, the beef with bamboo was the most tender and recent we have ever eaten and the spring rolls were generously stuffed as they should be, everything was delicious and very good, thank you very much, the first of many..."
ChIJ0YKtOSEpQg0RnvSRcvDirFQ,4,"It was a nice place with good Honduran food. The baleadas, tostones and the parilla mixta were very delicious.

The baleadas were my favourite dish because of it's unique taste, you can always be fine with them

The tostones were accompanied with cheese and mantequilla. Super yummy.

The owners were super friendly and shared some of their life experiences in Spain which makes someone feel even more welcomed.

I recommend this place."
ChIJ0YKtOSEpQg0RnvSRcvDirFQ,5,"We have been there to try food from Honduras.  All was new for us. Other then we know fro Mexican restaurants.  Nevertheless very tasty: pupupas ( maiz pancakes), meat, rice, and NACHOS.
Very nice young lady who served us. We wish you all the best for future.  Kind regards from Germany"
ChIJ0YKtOSEpQg0RnvSRcvDirFQ,5,"Authentic, fresh and truly delicious food. We were totally impressed by the tostones, flautas and arroz chino! Absolutely will return . Actually my husband said it‚Äôs the best arroz chino in all Madrid. Lovely service! Thank you !!"

ChIJgTVKBgAnQg0RBWAow3RbL9E,5,"Casa de Comidas Cabrera is a hidden gem for those looking for quality homemade food and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. From the moment you walk in, you can feel the dedication of this family in every detail. The service is friendly and close, they make you feel at home from the beginning.

The food is the true protagonist: dishes prepared with fresh ingredients and with that authentic flavor that you only find in the best home kitchens. Both the stews, meats and desserts are a real delight. In addition, the portions are generous, ideal to enjoy with the whole family.

The atmosphere is relaxed and perfect for enjoying a quiet meal. The value for money is also appreciated, as they offer an excellent dining experience without breaking the bank.

If you are looking for a restaurant that combines good food, tradition and impeccable customer service, Casa de Comidas Cabrera is a must-visit. Highly recommended!"
ChIJgTVKBgAnQg0RBWAow3RbL9E,5,"It is very difficult to get a reservation but I was finally able to make it and the experience has been more than satisfactory.
First we had a spectacular cheese and ham board.
As a main course we ordered cachopo, a real scandal üòãüòã. The chef let us repeat and try new flavors.
The terrace is fully heated with heaters for the winter.
It is a new opening, the quality and service is unbeatable and they will soon have to expand the space due to the high demand of diners.
The chef is charming and constantly makes sure his guests are as good as possible.
I hope to return soon üòòüòòüòò"
ChIJgTVKBgAnQg0RBWAow3RbL9E,5,"He is an unmatched chef. The stew, the oxtail, chickpeas with ears and chanterelles....
Today we tried the cachopo and it is unbeatable. The treatment is incredible and the hospitality is unsurpassed. Advisable!!"
ChIJgTVKBgAnQg0RBWAow3RbL9E,5,"Spectacular cooked, impressive oxtail. Mandatory a ball after eating. The aforementioned is a unique chef."
ChIJgTVKBgAnQg0RBWAow3RbL9E,4,"Since I know this place, I can't go anywhere else, it is simply exceptional.
The lamb I had last time was dry, although the chef made up for it with a rich and delicious sauce.
Otherwise, everything is correct: exceptional service, very cozy atmosphere and abundant portions.
The house specialty is spoon dishes and rice.
I don't give 5 stars because perfection does not exist and there is always something to improve (like the lamb) but as if I had given them.
PS: there is no dessert menu."
ChIJR34XUhcpQg0Rnb0iOqHyiTY,5,Cool place
ChIJR34XUhcpQg0Rnb0iOqHyiTY,4,"Good prices. Quick and friendly service.

ChIJR34XUhcpQg0Rnb0iOqHyiTY,5,"The service is very good, the atmosphere is not out of this world either, but the kebab is excellent, very delicious. And the owners of the place are very friendly. It's a 9.9/10"
ChIJR34XUhcpQg0Rnb0iOqHyiTY,5,spectacular place good meat good sauce good workers very attentive and pleasant I always buy kebabs and durum here because they are the best in the neighborhood
ChIJkd4OQuwpQg0RW0Ct7fwNJrc,5,"Fabulous tapas, great beers, super friendly staff and patrons. We really enjoyed our time here"
ChIJkd4OQuwpQg0RW0Ct7fwNJrc,5,Great meet sandwiches. Meet is coocked at the moment on demand and on a fire grill. Very good value for price and fast service. Really friendly atmosphere.
ChIJkd4OQuwpQg0RW0Ct7fwNJrc,5,Free tapas with cheap drinks and incomparable ambiance. What more could you ask for?
ChIJkd4OQuwpQg0RW0Ct7fwNJrc,5,A nice spot for a quick beer ‚Äì the staff were very welcoming.
ChIJkd4OQuwpQg0RW0Ct7fwNJrc,4,"A bit rough and at late hours also a bit of a rough crowd.
Cheep beer and open later than they should be.
Great atmosphere!"
ChIJJfQdDswnQg0R5ewotsn4AZI,5,"Good restaurant to dine in. It has great shawarma üòã and falafel.
The price is cheap and I recommend it in your way üëç"
ChIJJfQdDswnQg0R5ewotsn4AZI,5,"Occasionally passed by when I was so hungry and didn‚Äôt know what I should have for lunch! I came in and realized that it was a new business! The owner and his staff were super friendly; there was nothing to complain about the service.
I ordered a Durum Kebab - the flavor was different from other places where they tried to fill more with lettuce and onion instead of meat - the one that I had here was savory and full of meat! Well, if you are a carnivorous like me, you might like their kebabs/durums.
There are more dishes such as chicken wings, roasted chicken, and salads with their varieties in ‚Äúmenu‚Äù.
Recommended!! üëçüëç"
ChIJJfQdDswnQg0R5ewotsn4AZI,1,"They are making people sick, i bought a durim from them last night, in which they used two three days old meet that they heated up in the oven and prepared the durum with that. After eating i got severe pain in my stomach. Totally not recommended, and i will report the police as well."
ChIJJfQdDswnQg0R5ewotsn4AZI,5,Good & yammy food‚ù§üéä
ChIJJfQdDswnQg0R5ewotsn4AZI,5,Such a delicious food ü•Ø
ChIJcf76FH4nQg0REVQPhaiv-Ho,5,"This is a small local restaurant located about a 10 minute walk from below the palace in a local neighborhood. Excellent food in a family owned restaurant using recipes handed down by their grandmother. Very friendly, quiet, and welcome relaxation after visiting busy tourist spots. Real Madrid. Try the chicken dish, which is wrapped in a dough bread. Unbelievably good. The owner was super friendly."
ChIJcf76FH4nQg0REVQPhaiv-Ho,5,"The menu is not a long one, but they do not need it. Anything you will order will be yummy and with a very special taste. It is not the typical flavours you would expect, they add something lovely to each bite.
The area is now full of nice restaurants, but you should try this one over the rest."
ChIJcf76FH4nQg0REVQPhaiv-Ho,5,Even though they were extremely busy with a Christmas party they still attended to my small group without issue. They put us towards the back so we could have some quiet from the Christmas party which was really nice. The food was also really delicious.
ChIJcf76FH4nQg0REVQPhaiv-Ho,5,"This was probably the best meal experience we had while in Madrid. In a nation of very kind people and amazing food dishes, Gozar stood out. The flavor combinations were insanely delicious and the owner, introducing himself as 'the English menu,' was superbly friendly, very knowledgeable and offered excellent recommendations. We had torreznos, ensaladilla rusa, pan chino al vapor con pollo, and the recommended fresa brioche postre. My mother in law also raved about the tapas olives she received with her red wine."
ChIJcf76FH4nQg0REVQPhaiv-Ho,5,"BEER LOVERS must go there, a total of 45 kinds of beer you can choose!!! üçªThe owner is a beer expert, you can enjoy a lot of special and excellent beer here. The food is very diverse, with only ten dishes but each one is super delicious üòã (  I heard that dishes are changed every month, I'm looking forward to going back next timeÔºÅ)"
ChIJdVDTjQUpQg0RLolf3XKiC-A,5,"Very delicious ceviche, and natural wines that go well with the food. An authentic place in the neighborhood, a very nice owner!"
ChIJdVDTjQUpQg0RLolf3XKiC-A,5,"Good thing! The classic ceviche is super authentic and pure and the lemon fish tiradito is super delicious. Dani also made us discover the olive octopus. I repeat, fixed! Looking forward to trying the vegetarian ceviche‚Ä¶ We will be back. Thank you so much! Spectacular!"
ChIJdVDTjQUpQg0RLolf3XKiC-A,5,Good ceviche made fresh and of quality! One of the best in the neighborhood to taste a real ceviche like in Peru. Good house wine and good well-drafted beer.
ChIJdVDTjQUpQg0RLolf3XKiC-A,5,Spectacular! Everything super well taken care of. The pairing of natural wines (I highly recommend the Claret) with the Ceviches is A-1 and a very novel proposal in Madrid. The attention to detail and good vibes are felt throughout the entire experience.
ChIJdVDTjQUpQg0RLolf3XKiC-A,5,"Cozy atmosphere and treatment!!! The best wine, the classic Ceviche without further ado, simple and of very good quality SUCCESS!!!üëèüèºüëèüèºüåπüí´"
ChIJozCS4HcoQg0RrX_GowuiJko,3,"We were warmly welcomed and even received a small bottle of cava as a gift for our anniversary, which was a lovely touch. The venue isn‚Äôt very large and was fully booked, so I recommend making a reservation in advance. Service was very good ‚Äî attentive and helpful.

Since our menu included both fish and meat, we opted for wine by the glass rather than a full bottle. We were recommended a glass of red wine priced around ‚Ç¨30. While the wine was good, it was served a bit too cold for a red.

The food was okay, but not particularly memorable. We also noticed that portion sizes seemed to vary between tables.

We spent around ‚Ç¨450 for the evening. While it was a unique experience, especially thanks to the great show, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd choose to repeat it at that price point."
ChIJozCS4HcoQg0RrX_GowuiJko,5,"What a great dinner and show! This was a highlight of our visit to Madrid. The wine at dinner was excellent and the 5 course meal was a little different but it‚Äôs always fun to expand the palate and try new things. It was a large room so you were seated in close proximity of others but if you enjoy that as we do you‚Äôll have fun! Most of the people near us were from the States so that made the conversations flow easier!
The show was wonderful and the performers were excellent! A must do in Madrid!"
ChIJozCS4HcoQg0RrX_GowuiJko,5,A must see for your trip to Madrid! This is the oldest flamenco show in city center. Great performers and the food was surprisingly good! Celebrated my birthday here and they made it special with a petite birthday brownie just for me. Nice touch!
ChIJozCS4HcoQg0RrX_GowuiJko,5,"Superb experience here! Highly recommend you book dinner here - we have the best table and view - great treat for my birthday! The performance was outstanding, everyone was brilliant - loved the dancers and singers! Staff were great and friendly! Good was delicious - loved the lamb! Make sure you book ahead and queue on time or make a preference for table - we were right at the front!"
ChIJozCS4HcoQg0RrX_GowuiJko,4,"Okay, so the show itself is a 5/5. They are truly exceptional artists and at the top of their craft.

The wait staff is also wonderful, kind, and attentive.  Very professional.

However, the food is really, really bad. Like just barely above plane food. How in the world this has a Michelin star is beyond me. And if you book the 9:30 dinner/show (which I did because I figured the show started at like 10), you will have to wait until 11:15 for the show to start.

So, if you can get tickets to just the show, do that!"
ChIJASUJC3goQg0RREuVVQN2z5w,5,Tinto de Verano was great here to try for the first time (yay pitchers!) and the selection of beers and wines was also good. Only got to try the croquettes but they were INCREDIBLE and I would highly recommend. Sits on a nice quiet (or lively depending when you go) little Plaza which was very relaxing after a long day of traveling.
ChIJASUJC3goQg0RREuVVQN2z5w,5,"Staff are friendly and polite, service was fast on Monday afternoon.food was really good.fried squid is very tasty and must have. Charcoal scallops very unique taste. Marinated pork was tender and delicious. Ham and mango Salad was good."
ChIJASUJC3goQg0RREuVVQN2z5w,5,"Loved it! Nice date night. Lola Simone is sultry and talented. Food was outstanding (we had the tasting menu - do it!). Service was quick, helpful. We got there at the first sitting at 8:30pm and it was empty for the first 20+ minutes. Oops. We just had more vermut to fill the time."
ChIJASUJC3goQg0RREuVVQN2z5w,3,"Food was ok, but you can find better around, staff is a bit hit or miss, depending on the minute you need them, the toilet is nicely decorated.
Expect a surcharge if you sit on the terrace."
ChIJASUJC3goQg0RREuVVQN2z5w,5,Kudos to the chef. The dish is perfect. Strongly recommended üëç
ChIJ_-pUnNcnQg0RJJUYTCru3B8,4,"We recently dined at this restaurant and had a delightful experience. The tapas and meat served were incredibly delicious, showcasing authentic local flavors. While the meat was slightly undercooked for my preference, it was still very tasty and enjoyable.

The beer was served perfectly cold, which complemented the meal wonderfully. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, adding to the overall positive experience. The owner, although a bit reserved, was still courteous.

Overall, it was a very good experience with excellent local food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to enjoy delicious tapas and meat in a welcoming atmosphere."
ChIJ_-pUnNcnQg0RJJUYTCru3B8,5,"A neighborhood restaurant with delicious  food, cooked with fresh ingredients. Friendly service and relaxing atmosphere. This was our second visit to this establishment."
ChIJ_-pUnNcnQg0RJJUYTCru3B8,5,"A local spot with some of the best food I had in Spain. Our waiter was extremely accommodating with our broken Spanish and helped us understand what was in each dish. Paella, scallops, and chorizo were top notch and prices were very reasonable"
ChIJ_-pUnNcnQg0RJJUYTCru3B8,5,"I had an amazing time here, me and my friends arrived late and they were almost closing but all the staff treated us so well and made sure that we have nice experience
We ate an incredible paella and croquetas de jamon both were fresh made for us besides that very good price
Definitely a must go"
ChIJ_-pUnNcnQg0RJJUYTCru3B8,5,Small neighbourhood business with great food! Super tasty rice dish and the portions are extremely generous! I recommend it!
ChIJcyRxF3goQg0RM-9qLmaDIs4,3,"Went for a dinner with several friend after we got reccommendations for the Margaritas.

Service - First we ordered drinks but the waitress brought all except mine, and had to wait like 15 min to get my beer. We were 6 people and they just brought one set of sauces and didn't bother to bring another set so everyone can try it, even when we ran out. Later we had to ask a few time for the same things on different occasions. The servers were nice but not very profesional.

Food - ""meh"" would be the best way to describe it. The meet quesadilla were decent, baja tacos flavorless, guacamole was the tiniest ever, pastor tacos were hedious, margaritas were good.

They had a Mariachi band the sang pretty nice, but the acoustics at the restaurant is horrible and it was so loud you couldn't even hear the person right next to me you. We literally had to shut up until they were done.

Vale for money - an average of of 4 euros per taco is quite expensive l, especially for this quality so 3/10.

Won't be back as there are way better Mexican restaurants in Madrid for half the price."
ChIJcyRxF3goQg0RM-9qLmaDIs4,5,"Just a bit over stuffed in the dining room. But we've eaten on the terrace before. Always good food and kind service. One of the best Mexican restaurants in Madrid,  if a bit pricy."
ChIJcyRxF3goQg0RM-9qLmaDIs4,5,"Recommended by our Mexican niece. We had a great meal outside on the terrace in a beautifully peaceful green corner of 'Madrid de los Austrias', complete with birdsong.

We started with excellent large 'margaritas' (a Mexican must) and shared a very good guacamole with chopped tomato and onion. The main course 'tacos' were chicken based: pollo campana and alambre de pollo, the latter with bacon, red and green peppers, onion and cheese. The shared  '3 leches' temptation dessert was also really good."
ChIJcyRxF3goQg0RM-9qLmaDIs4,3,The food was good but the terrace is untidy and the plants need tending (clearly not watered and used as ashtrays). What a shame! If you want to enjoy the terrace experience in old Madrid this is not the place to go. Plenty of other terraces in the area. If you are going for the Mexican food don't bother paying premium for a place in the terrace.
ChIJcyRxF3goQg0RM-9qLmaDIs4,5,"Authentic Mexican food, with nice staff and good prices. Advisable place to have dinner with either some friends or as a couple."
ChIJfZW-TXgoQg0RfaXh22Kuy7c,5,"I had an amazing dining experience at this restaurant, all thanks to our fantastic server, Henry! From the moment we sat down, Henry made us feel welcomed and ensured we had everything we needed. He was friendly, attentive, and provided excellent recommendations on the menu. The food came out quickly, hot, and absolutely delicious. Henry truly made our visit special, and we can‚Äôt wait to return! Highly recommend!"
ChIJfZW-TXgoQg0RfaXh22Kuy7c,5,Great Mole and great service. Had a great time here I hope you do the same. Ask for Johan he is first class.
ChIJfZW-TXgoQg0RfaXh22Kuy7c,3,"Maybe the plates that we ordered weren't their best, but the fajitas mix were just ok (nothing special) and the quesadillas were a little better. The atmosphere is very nice."
ChIJfZW-TXgoQg0RfaXh22Kuy7c,5,"It was very nice even better than my dream.
beautiful place for eat with beautiful people."
ChIJfZW-TXgoQg0RfaXh22Kuy7c,5,Great authentic Tex-mex! The restaurant is decorated super cute and the waiter was very friendly. I finally had a good margarita here in Spain! Will recommend to others and return.
ChIJgfnH-XcoQg0RSXS_O1KvsxQ,5,"It was a cold December night, we did not want to walk far. This place was a minute walk away from our rent house so it‚Äôs perfect

Food was great! We ordered 5-6 tapas for the 3 of us. Every single dish tasted delicious. My favorite was the Patatas Bravas, what can I say‚Ä¶ I have fried potatoes are my weakness. Our meal ends with tiramisu and cheesecake.

The whole dinner was a very pleasant experience."
ChIJgfnH-XcoQg0RSXS_O1KvsxQ,5,"Delicious food, kind waiters, cosy ambiance, highly recommended. Tasty paella, delicious cod and croquettes, calamari, and secret pork recipe. good vibes. Chalereux. Will definitely revisit every time we visit Madrid."
ChIJgfnH-XcoQg0RSXS_O1KvsxQ,5,Few steps away  from the Royal Palace we saw the sign on the road for this characteristic Madrid tavern. They prepared the table for us even though it was after 3.30pm. Great food and friendly staff. Top choice
ChIJgfnH-XcoQg0RSXS_O1KvsxQ,5,"We stopped here after visiting a nearby park. We are really glad we did. The food was amazing. Definitely one of our favorite places from our trip. Wife and I both ordered from the menu of the day but tried different items, both were great. We ordered our daughter meatballs and those were ridiculously good as well. Service was also excellent. Great value for the money, highly recommend this spot which is off the beaten path."
ChIJgfnH-XcoQg0RSXS_O1KvsxQ,5,"Stopped in today for a quick lunch and was not disappointed. We decided to opt out if the Menu del D√≠a because we both wanted to try the Burrata, it was lovely. We also split the secreto. While the secreto was slightly on the dry side, it was accompanied by some fantastic apples and a great mustardy chutney. I will be back for more again soon."
ChIJ4eUsJ9gnQg0REdO-ao4VCpk,5,"It was an experience, we had an authentic lunch and fun discovering the typical tapas and drinks of the place. It is local, I guess we were the only tourists there. Ask the staff for some advice on the food and drink, if you‚Äôre not familiar with Spanish/southern Spanish tabernas. It‚Äôs not the regular paella and sangria place. We liked it!"
ChIJ4eUsJ9gnQg0REdO-ao4VCpk,5,It was like stepping into another time period and place (Sanlucar de Barrameda in the 1960‚Äôs). I had an enjoyable evening in the company of friends and acquaintances. The service was impeccable. The food and wine were excellent. I ordered the Solomillo with the peppered sauce. Melts in your mouth.
ChIJ4eUsJ9gnQg0REdO-ao4VCpk,5,"One of our true favorites over the past five years. For awhile we went every week. The represents the best of Cadiz and southern Andalusian cuisine. Our all time favorite is the cheek stew (carrillada). Fork tender with soft carrots and a wonderful gravy. And plenty of bread for that gravy. Other top plates are the mojama (smoked tuna) and tortillitas with shrimp. We‚Äôve even sampled urchin there in the past and the cazon en adobo is very good. They serve a really great red , Ramon Bilbao, and many guests enjoy the vermouth. Our server Jose was super friendly and kept things moving quickly while still managing lively conversation with everyone !  Definitely stop by when in Madrid."
ChIJ4eUsJ9gnQg0REdO-ao4VCpk,4,"The food was fantastic. The service was the opposite. Our waiter forgot about multiple dishes we ordered, and he did not put them into the kitchen until I had to repeat the order to him. Try writing orders down next time"
ChIJ4eUsJ9gnQg0REdO-ao4VCpk,5,"Quaint tavern for wine, beer, and delicious food.   There are only seven small barrel tables in the main dining room.  The walls are decorated with old bullfighting posters and what not.  The waiter took his time, but in a good way he would sit at all the tables and chat with the patrons.  His food suggestions were excellent and very pleasant. They had run out of some popular items, yes I'm looking at you, croquetas de la abuela, when we ordered.  He brought over a bean and olive tapa to nibble on as you look at the menu.   Enjoyed the tortillitas de camar√≥n caseras, adobo sanluqueno, papas con choco.  Recommend!"
ChIJm-bNHdYnQg0RgSAiXTGLJak,5,"In the mood for real Italian food? Emma y Julia is the place!

ChIJm-bNHdYnQg0RgSAiXTGLJak,5,"Great authentic Italian restaurant. The pulpo  carpaccio was not that good, the pulpo itself was very dry. The pasta vongole was very good and the price is very good too. The staff was friendly but some people didn't seem very happy to be working there."
ChIJm-bNHdYnQg0RgSAiXTGLJak,4,"I discovered this little Italian restaurant in the heart of the city and fell in love! The fresh handmade pasta is sublime, and the service is attentive and friendly. The cozy atmosphere and rustic decor make you feel right at home. Don't miss their famous truffle risotto! 10/10 recommend!"
ChIJm-bNHdYnQg0RgSAiXTGLJak,1,"We waited for 20 mins and no one served us. Not recommended unless you have to. Restaurants are busy in Madrid. Recommend you book other restaurants earlier.

Plus, we asked checks for three times and eventually succeeded. I understood people are busy during the busy hours, but I think we are the only table treated in this way. Other servants are fine, it‚Äôs the lady who takes the order who keeps ignoring us and made us uncomfortable."
ChIJm-bNHdYnQg0RgSAiXTGLJak,5,"This restaurant was recommended to us and it did not disappoint. The staff is so friendly and e really enjoyed the food. We love the Naomi salad, if you don‚Äôt like sweet it‚Äôs not for you, and the dark chocolate mousse was GREAT! My husband said the lasagna is now one of his favorites."
ChIJ36S2etgnQg0RNHg4NS9T62c,5,This restaurant proves that simplicity done right is perfection. They use high-quality ingredients and let the flavors speak for themselves. I had the best tomato I‚Äôve ever tasted in my life.
ChIJ36S2etgnQg0RNHg4NS9T62c,5,"Absolutely beautiful! The service was amazing!  waiter and what a waiter, he is the best, The Best waiter iv ever had. He helped choose the menu and made sure my group was well entertained. It's no wonder so many celebrities come here!

I highly 100% recommend this place! I cannot emphasize enough! You have to come here!!!"
ChIJ36S2etgnQg0RNHg4NS9T62c,5,"2nd time visiting, and i found it even better than the first! We loved: Jamon croquetas (best in Spain, & we ate a sh1t-ton), the tomato salad (insanely good, & i hope to be buried with some), any steak (esp. The churasco for 2), & of course the tortilla con chorizo.
The staff mostly only speak Spanish - though they re terrific & super-friendly), but my ‚ÄôItalian-Spanish‚Äô was good enough.
Highly recommend!"
ChIJ36S2etgnQg0RNHg4NS9T62c,5,"This is one of my favorites in Madrid, you can‚Äôt go wrong eating in this magnificent place.
From starters to entrees everything great!
House wine Contino is Amazing!
Finish with a delicious arroz con leche and a cortado coffee.
We were lucky to see Angel, he is retired and Alejandro has taken the management doing a great job, he is also great!"
ChIJ36S2etgnQg0RNHg4NS9T62c,5,"Ok I‚Äôve been leaving a few five star reviews in Madrid. But wow these restaurants are good.
Today we tried almost everything. But can we start with the house wine?! How is it so refreshing?
Tomatoes - just full of flavor
Tomato toast + jamon‚Ä¶. What can I say. It is shockingly good jamon.
Heuvos rotos - is like an egg fry‚Ä¶. Oddly delicious and unexpected‚Ä¶ evidently a typical Madrid favorite but quite good.
Fish, steak, clams, lamb‚Ä¶ all of it was great.
The vibe was classic. Pictures everywhere - reminded me of walking into a 1970s American movie star steakhouse in Palm Springs‚Ä¶ except real, Bette, delicious food! So good!"
ChIJG0kf5dYnQg0RHcKX_RqPiVw,5,"We‚Äôve been eating all over, and this place is fantastic. If you get the chance, come here. We got the J. Martin Peppers burger and cheesecake. The cheesecake was the best Spanish cheesecake we‚Äôve had in Spain. Thank you for the best service and food in Madrid."
ChIJG0kf5dYnQg0RHcKX_RqPiVw,5,"I have stumbled into this place by case. I read ""croquetas"" and I decided to go inside.

I tool a Tortilla with a slice of bread: very good. The egg was oozy enough and the potatoes little with little onion.

Afterwards hearing Javier sepaking and describing a cake, I took it.

Basically a type of new york cheese cake with three different cheese, very good served with marmelade and some crumble.

I want to come back, in order to try the croquetas, as I was too full to give it a go.

The owner is very welcoming and nice.

I will be back."
ChIJG0kf5dYnQg0RHcKX_RqPiVw,5,"Excellent food and an amazing host.
They serve the best cheesecake I‚Äôve ever had, 10/10 would recommend."
ChIJG0kf5dYnQg0RHcKX_RqPiVw,5,"Great, atmospheric place close to the cathedral, very large portions, fresh and high quality food, good price for Madrid, the owner of the place is very nice and helpful, a place worth recommending. Everyone will find something good from a child to an adult"
ChIJG0kf5dYnQg0RHcKX_RqPiVw,5,First stop to eat in Madrid. Spain. Very glad we did. Owner was awesome and patient. Croquets are my new favorite. Plan on coming back a few more times before we leave.
ChIJxW4oDngoQg0RiTT7l4uLOBs,5,"I second the other guy‚Äôs review that inspired me to get a reservation despite being 35m and risking not making the kitchen cutoff at midnight - but it was WELL worth it for of the best steaks I‚Äôve had the luck of finding while out in Spain and Italy for the last 3 weeks.

GRAN BIFE DE VAC√çO is what I ordered, 800g of some of the best steak you can have out here & some delicious carrots & roasted potatoes on the side made this a meal that was perfect after a big workout at the hotel.

Service was smooth & polite, and I will absolutely be returning every time I am in Madrid!

You should for sure check it out - any true steak lover will not be disappointed ü§ùüèΩ"
ChIJxW4oDngoQg0RiTT7l4uLOBs,5,"5-star in every aspect.  Very cozy,  amazing atmosphere,  superb service,  and food is next level üëå üíØ"
ChIJxW4oDngoQg0RiTT7l4uLOBs,5,"Visited this establishment after visiting a local Flamenco show. Walked in and was seated and couldn't do enough for us. I'm a bigger gentleman, but they sorted us out good seating and served quickly and the steak we had was phenomenal. Best steak I have ever had. Fully recommend and will definitely return if ever in Madrid again!"
ChIJxW4oDngoQg0RiTT7l4uLOBs,5,"Interesting menu, efficient but pleasant service, well cooked and presented food, all in an intriguing atmosphere. We enjoyed our visit very much."
ChIJxW4oDngoQg0RiTT7l4uLOBs,5,Delicious food and friendly staff. The portions are quite generous and all of it was very flavorful. The big barbecue platter can easily feed 3+ people. Would definitely recommend this place!
ChIJS-B8ybcpQg0R-9xy9YFOysw,4,"Very nice terrace! Pricing suited for tourist.
I only had a few drinks, but I will be back to try the food.
It smelled good, and looked vast.

Their decoration may be welcoming for IG pictures as they have vibrant colors. Service was average."
ChIJS-B8ybcpQg0R-9xy9YFOysw,5,"What an amazing little jewel hidden in Madrid!

We originally had other plans, but by a series of coincidences, we ended up at this cozy little establishment tucked beyond the bustle of the streets.

The food was unique and delicious (caramelized salad, Ropa Vieja, and a specialty cod), and the price was great for this part of town (‚Ç¨84 for 4 dishes and 4 drinks). Service was exceptional, even without tipping (again, we were trying to save on money), and we were even treated to some shots of... well, I'm not sure what it was, but it was delicious and 100% free (I don't think they do this for everyone though...).

The location is also great. As I mentioned, the restaurant itself is away from the main streets of town and is inaccessible by car. While it might be an inconvenience at first, it provides for a calm and relaxing dinner in the (mostly) quiet side streets of Madrid. There's also a nice square just beside the location. For us, it was really a nice break from the hustle of tourist filled attractions.

In all, I would definitely recommend this establishment for anyone looking for good food, competitive prices, and quiet dining (or as quiet as you can get in central Madrid, lol)."
ChIJS-B8ybcpQg0R-9xy9YFOysw,5,This place was recommended to us by a friend in New York and im so glad we came. We ordered much of the menu between our party of 6 but fell in love with the tenderloin and plaintain chips and the ropa vieja! We came back two weeks later right before we flew back home to New York! 10/10
ChIJS-B8ybcpQg0R-9xy9YFOysw,1,I made the reservation through the open table app and the restaurant website. I got confirmation that my reservation was ready. When we got to the restaurant it was closed. The fork app was also showing the restaurant as available. They should follow up on How the face the customers and answer the phone.
ChIJS-B8ybcpQg0R-9xy9YFOysw,5,"I had an absolutely fantastic time. The waiter, Juan Carlos, was extremely attentive to us and even took the time to chat and personalize with our group. The food was absolutely fantastic, and the olives he brought out tasted absolutely delicious, as well as the honey rum digestive. Our party of 7 managed to eat for quite a reasonable price."
ChIJU-eRytgnQg0R7VTOHENZwjk,5,"The food was very tasty, and the portions were just right (neither small not huge portions), specially the chapche, the meat with the soy sauce and the tiramisu. The service was also very good and fast (everything we ordered came in about 5/7min from ordering) and the ambiance it's very calm and welcoming, as the interior of the restaurant looks like an old house. If you make a reservation with the fork, you get a 30%  discount, which is always nice. I highly recommend it."
ChIJU-eRytgnQg0R7VTOHENZwjk,5,"Surprising food, amazing taste, suite surprising th√© variety and flavors, worth it.
Hopping for more veggie option"
ChIJU-eRytgnQg0R7VTOHENZwjk,5,"went to this restaurant a few hours ago, it was absolutely brilliant. the service was amazing and everyone was so nice, and the food was so good!!! i had steamed dumplings, fried dumplings, chapchae, bibimpab, bulgogi, and patbingsu. i‚Äôll definitely be going there again!! hopefully i can go again soon"
ChIJU-eRytgnQg0R7VTOHENZwjk,5,Loved the food here! Authentic Korean and the option to grill your own meats at the table. Great if you are looking for Korean food or want to try something different.
ChIJU-eRytgnQg0R7VTOHENZwjk,5,Men√∫ del d√≠a was ok but a little boring. I might try the barbecue at the table
ChIJ27LkMtYnQg0R_qp4iSYR1UY,5,"The food is delicious.  The atmosphere fabulous.  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. The pricing is excellent. This was my first time in Madrid, and I ended up going both nights, as it was so good. Can't wait to go back next time I visit."
ChIJ27LkMtYnQg0R_qp4iSYR1UY,5,"Certainly one of the most interesting menus you‚Äôll find in Spain. Plates are somewhere between a tapa and a racion. But the creativity and flavor combinations are incredible. I‚Äôve been going here since 2017 and have never been disappointed. This time I tried duck filled cannelloni in a wild mushroom sauce. Also had moussaka. Just incredible flavors. And the is fun, cozy and has jazz themed decor."
ChIJ27LkMtYnQg0R_qp4iSYR1UY,4,"We were in Madrid last October
and arrived at this unassuming neighbourhood
with no expectations.
Lamiak Cava Baja‚Äôs facade was brightly lit and welcoming. Upon entering, there were several people already in the queue.
The dining space was neither large nor small.
It wasn‚Äôt sardine packed as there was ample space for the servers to move around. The wait couldn‚Äôt have been more than 30 minutes and suddenly we were seated at a communal table alongside other diners. Our server Marisol was in top form. She welcomed us with a friendly smile coupled with seasoned professionalism.
She was clearly in control as she handled everyone in the queue with such confidence.
The food here, I must add was a  delight without being showy.
The octopus carpaccio over potato parmentier melted in your mouth.
Duck confit in puff pastry was yummy.
Their signature stewed beef didn‚Äôt disappoint. And the Iberico and melon salad generously sprinkled with roasted pine nuts was a great accompaniment to our orders.
Sadly our appetite didn‚Äôt allow us to order more.
We definitely could have!"
ChIJ27LkMtYnQg0R_qp4iSYR1UY,5,"Checked out this eatery when tapas hunting down this street.

The place was crowded with locals but managed to get a table. Menu items all looked inexpensive and intriguing.

Got the pulso (octopus üêô) and smoked salmon which were very well prepared and accentuated with amazing culinary skills. Given how packed out the place was, everything was served really quickly within 10 minutes.

A pity that tapas items like these cost an arm and leg ü¶µ back home üè° These are items which can easily be enjoyed at any time of the day only in Spain üá™üá∏

Do support this place and check it out if doing a tapas crawl. Pretty sure that all items here will hit the spot!"
ChIJ27LkMtYnQg0R_qp4iSYR1UY,5,"Well worth a visit, food is amazing and we'll priced for Madrid, great atmosphere.
Kitchen open 13.00 to Midnight... no wonder it is so busy. Highly recommend."
ChIJ-b0b_9YnQg0RmIOY4VxPCU4,4,"A very good Spanish restaurant serving traditional Spanish food in a nice location. Excellent service and a lot of tables and chairs, they have a bar area and full restaurant through the back of the bar. The menu is varied with lota of choices. I had prawns and octopus and both were super. The house salad was also delicious. Great food and drink and a great option very reasonably priced too"
ChIJ-b0b_9YnQg0RmIOY4VxPCU4,4,"Traditional styled galician place. We were not very sure at the beginning, but the food proved to be delicious. The prawn carpaccio and the octopus stood out, very flavourful, soft and nicely cooked. The rice with prawn had delicious kind of soup-sauce, there wasn't much seafood in it, but just the rice itself was very tasty. The staff was quite friendly, though I would have a recommendation to ask if we are finished with the food before collecting the food or the plates. Otherwise, a very enjoyable experience."
ChIJ-b0b_9YnQg0RmIOY4VxPCU4,5,"A very nice neighbourhood restaurant with very warm and welcoming personnel. Wonderful steak, one of the best i have ever had. Great selection of wines also served by half-bottle."
ChIJ-b0b_9YnQg0RmIOY4VxPCU4,5,"Found this restaurant on our next to last night in Spain and enjoyed it so much we went again for our final dinner. The food was delicious. We both had steak though different kinds. Mine was accompanied by whole roasted peppers and some sort of potato dish that was delightful. I had chorizo here for the first time (as a small appetizer they bring out, which you will be charged for). The staff was friendly, and they have English menus if you need them."
ChIJ-b0b_9YnQg0RmIOY4VxPCU4,4,"Very good experience. Almost family like place, great service and recommended. Seafood is very good, fresh and tasty. Adequate wine selection. Recommended."
ChIJISgf5XcoQg0R-MIwrHodt1I,3,"In few words | Overpriced. Only bottled beer. Service good if you are lucky. Lots of birds and flies. Beautiful views.

I only recommend this place if you with your tourists friends to have some beers. As a one time event is enjoyable :)

Food is way too expensive for the quality you'll get.

Waiters can be nice if you are lucky with who's serving you. Read a few other reviews and you'll understand (I was lucky when I went)."
ChIJISgf5XcoQg0R-MIwrHodt1I,3,"You will love this restaurant for its view, you will have one of the best view in Madrid and you can have lunch or dinner there or only for drinking."
ChIJISgf5XcoQg0R-MIwrHodt1I,2,"The views are amazing but this is definitely a tourist trap. We sat for dinner and unfortunately had to walk away after 1 beer each and some papas bravas. We still payed ‚Ç¨18 for the bill. A small bottled beer for ‚Ç¨4.50 and papas bravas for ‚Ç¨9.00 is just abusive. A small plate of olives was ‚Ç¨6.00.

The food looked good but unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get to try it because we didn‚Äôt think the prices were worth it. The table next to ours also wasn‚Äôt happy with their bill.

The service was good and it is really an amazing location, but it‚Äôs a shame that they try to take advantage of tourists with prices like that."
ChIJISgf5XcoQg0R-MIwrHodt1I,4,"Lovely place to eat outside. The view is spectacular. The service was great too.
I had the very overpriced ‚Äúpulpo‚Äù and it was a bit too salty.
Also: They only had mahou, not estrella galicia."
ChIJISgf5XcoQg0R-MIwrHodt1I,4,"Stopped here on a wine. All locals, that‚Äôs a good sign! Only a few staff spoke broken English (which was still better than my Spanish, kudos to them).  Food was good enough. Sept 2022: flat rate of 18 euros for a three course meal with bread, water, and table wine. They accommodated our vegetarians with simple pasta."
ChIJnbhUeXcoQg0Rj7gl-m7dgjM,5,"A taste of traditional Spain at this place near the Royal Palace. Reserve a table in the salon for a 2PM lunch. This place gets very, very busy, so be prepared for a bit of hectic action. The Regalitos de Torito are fantastic. Everything on the menu very good. Also, for the price, you get a good value."
ChIJnbhUeXcoQg0Rj7gl-m7dgjM,5,"Beautiful traditional eateries located near the Royal Palace. Very traditional tapas menu with fantastic freshly cooked food. The staff are very welcoming and friendly. Very traditional place you could easily just come for drinks or tapas but I would highly recommend both, we loved it. The wine choices are excellent try the house wine first you probably will be very happy.

(One thing to note, the food is so nice but if you are used to UK tapas portions, you will find the portion sizes here about twice the size of at home so be careful not to over order. That said, they are so kind, the staff will package up food if you want to take away)."
ChIJnbhUeXcoQg0Rj7gl-m7dgjM,5,"Just wonderful sitting outside and taking our time to eat, drink, and enjoy the atmosphere sitting in front of the cathedral. The food was delicious, the octopus was fresh and not chewy at all. The bacalao was cooked well and fresh and tasty. Made for a great early afternoon meal."
ChIJnbhUeXcoQg0Rj7gl-m7dgjM,5,"The traditional tapas was one of the best I tried, the portion was huge and luckily the waiter stopped us from over ordering. The staff is also very polite and friendly. Overall a very nice dining experience!"
ChIJnbhUeXcoQg0Rj7gl-m7dgjM,4,Currently construction around the outdoor seating area is a bit distracting but this place is nice and close to the cathedral. Staff was busy but friendly. Food was good. Steak is wonderfully presented and medium well. Cuddle fish has lots to share and cooked well.
ChIJ7aVnUQsoQg0RPjzUpJGzI0g,5,"Nice place, with amazing views of Madrid. Ideal for a sunny day.
Went on the weekend, a bit overpriced compared to other places, but the location pays off."
ChIJ7aVnUQsoQg0RPjzUpJGzI0g,4,"Food for me was 4.5 but it‚Äôs not available, the croquetas were delicious but a bit too salty. Dessert was perfect and so were the drinks, so refreshing and good price. They also include little snacks with your drinks which is always a good thing. Service was a little bit slow sometimes but also the restaurant was full that day so I think it could be normal."
ChIJ7aVnUQsoQg0RPjzUpJGzI0g,3,"Positive: the location is great!

Food: I didn‚Äôt enjoy the ‚Äúmenu del dia‚Äù at all. The food was subprime and felt old/reheated. I didn‚Äôt take a photo of the vegetable lasagna but it was really bland and similar to a lasagna you can eat in the airplane. The burger and fries you can see in the picture and judge by yourselves, fries were inedible‚Ä¶ the chocolate coulant was not homemade and served cold!! Overall really disappointing.

Service: fair, not too friendly and a bit rushed."
ChIJ7aVnUQsoQg0RPjzUpJGzI0g,5,Sit on the rooftop for great views. We didn‚Äôt order food. Just some cocktails for us and Fantas for our kids. Our drinks came with a little snack of potato chips and olives.
ChIJ7aVnUQsoQg0RPjzUpJGzI0g,4,"My family and I stopped by to enjoy some dessert. The outdoor seating was beautiful. It was a welcome way to relax in the August heat of Madrid. We ordered the lotus cake, the Death by Chocolate cake and the Abuela's cake. All three were fantastic. All were a little spendy - around 6 Euros."
ChIJmRdIFCcpQg0R8HV3HFctS2E,5,"Just amazing selection of wild, rare, exotic mushrooms prepared in many different ways.. I'd give it 10 Stars instead of 5 if Google let me.   The food was amazing, and the service was over the top in a very quaint and cozy space.   I will be back again!!! Thank you for such an incredible experience."
ChIJmRdIFCcpQg0R8HV3HFctS2E,5,"This mushroom focussed restaurant is more than just that!

From the moment you walk in, you‚Äôre warmly welcomed. The service staff knows the menu well and takes you through each course that is served. From the palate cleanser we started to the dessert, everything was brilliant - including the wines.

If there is one wish for this place, I wish that the chefs go bold(er) and make the mushrooms more heroic in their dishes.

I‚Äôll definitely go back here! A recommended experience in Madrid."
ChIJmRdIFCcpQg0R8HV3HFctS2E,5,"Amazing place in the middle of the city center with simple, yet delicious food. The mushrooms are all prepared perfectly, and the accompanying ingredients are equally good. They have a single menu, which makes everything super easy. The service is incredible, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive!!"
ChIJmRdIFCcpQg0R8HV3HFctS2E,5,"The staff was wonderful and the food was very good. They were very nice and allowed us to make a last minute reservation for lunch. If you're a mushroom fan, you're in for a treat because there are definitely a lot of mushrooms."
ChIJmRdIFCcpQg0R8HV3HFctS2E,5,"We had enjoyed El Brote several years ago in their previous location and were thrilled to learn they had reopened in their current location. The concept of the restaurant is unusual: an entire tasting menu based on a variety of wild mushrooms. The creativity of the recipes is the secret to its success, though the excellent service and warm atmosphere all contribute. Finally, the prices are quite reasonable for such an exotic dining experience."
ChIJjTElVSyIQQ0R5J3uj1YKeOs,5,"I went there on a Saturday evening for dinner. Staff are very welcoming. The owner Marian was very welcoming and nice. She knows how to run this restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful, amazing design and comfortable seats. The food was 10/10. The desert was  amazing. I ordered pain perdu with ice cream. Don‚Äôt come to Madrid without trying it."
ChIJjTElVSyIQQ0R5J3uj1YKeOs,4,"If you're a serious foodie, you might want to consider my opinion

The tripe stew (callos a la madrile√±a) was stellar and a must try. It's not just tripe theres also pig skin and tendons all for a great collagen mess. All were reduced to mad sticky goodness and for someone who loves tripe, this is the stickiest stew I've had. Yes it's on the mild side but it goes w the free olives. Also, because it's so full of collagen it's really quite surfeiting after half a plate and I recommend you share this dish

Rice pudding had a nice aroma from orange zest and good crunch from the sugar but otherwise it was average

On the other hand, the eggs are really not it for the price. Yes it's good, it's tender and there's a nice aroma from the olive oil but there's no way you should pay 15‚Ç¨ for eggs and chips. That's crazy and the taste wasn't memorable

The oxtail stew was also good but not great. They got it to be very tender and fall off the bone, but it's not cooked in a sauce and so it's quite mild.

They were super nice to share a slice of jamon w me. It's got good complexity

If you come, come for the tripe stew which is a must try, and don't take other risks. Maybe the jamon only if u must"
ChIJjTElVSyIQQ0R5J3uj1YKeOs,5,"Great experience! They were very helpful with the food selection and drink selections!
We had the Lamb Shin and the Monk fish, both were really good! The lamb was so tender and most! ü§§ü§§
The wines were fantastic and as usual, very affordable!
Going back for lunch to try the ox tail and other items!"
ChIJjTElVSyIQQ0R5J3uj1YKeOs,4,New Spanish restaurant discovery!  Casa Lucio in Centro! There‚Äôs many new restaurants now however it‚Äôs still nice to just have the basic traditional classics!! Yummy huevos rotos and garlic soup
ChIJjTElVSyIQQ0R5J3uj1YKeOs,4,"Very good restaurant. This extremely popular restaurant requires reservations. While many Spanish dishes tend to be generously salted, I felt this restaurant uses relatively little salt as a seasoning, allowing me to taste the saltiness of the ingredients themselves."
ChIJvyD4IdYnQg0RpN614B-ee3Y,5,"Just amazing! I really enjoyed the food. The flavors were great. If I travel to Madrid again, I would definitely go back."
ChIJvyD4IdYnQg0RpN614B-ee3Y,5,"You will find this cozy spot among several tapas joints and bars. The unassuming exterior gives way to a warm and laid-back atmosphere inside. The wine selection is great and the food is simply delightful‚Äîportions are surprisingly generous. The service? Top-notch. If you're up for a chill vibe and traditional Spanish tapas, this place is highly recommended."
ChIJvyD4IdYnQg0RpN614B-ee3Y,5,"This is my second time in Madrid and third time in Casa Lucas. I mean I love you guys. Oxtail and chicken tostas are my all-time favorites, but that tomato salad with goat cheese was also very delish!"
ChIJvyD4IdYnQg0RpN614B-ee3Y,5,We had a late lunch here and really enjoyed it The food was great and the service was an also very nice. The atmosphere was fan but things special. The pork on onion bread. I also really liked the black pasta with carrots
ChIJvyD4IdYnQg0RpN614B-ee3Y,5,"Casa Lucas offers a unique and delicious twist on traditional Spanish cuisine.  A special shout out to John, our amazing server, who provided excellent recommendations and service.  I highly recommend the Rabo de Toro, a creative take on braised oxtail with plums and pistachios, served on a bed of mashed potatoes. The plums added a subtle sweetness that complemented the richness of the meat. The Arroz Cremosa, cooked in a flavorful mushroom broth and topped with foie gras and a poached egg, was another highlight. The earthy mushroom broth balanced perfectly with the foie gras. Even the simple tomato salad with goat cheese provided a nice refreshing touch to our meal. Casa Lucas elevates Spanish cuisine without any pretension, and they are incredibly welcoming to tourists. I only regret finding it on my last day, as I would have loved to try more of the menu. I will definitely return."
ChIJBybnhHgoQg0RoFuFYYueFb4,1,Canteen cuisine. Unprofessional service. Toilets abstain. Go your way
ChIJBybnhHgoQg0RoFuFYYueFb4,1,"They get us up from the table in a bad way because at 4:00 p.m. is not a good time to have coffee, with several empty tables. A lousy place."
ChIJBybnhHgoQg0RoFuFYYueFb4,5,Good
ChIJBybnhHgoQg0RoFuFYYueFb4,3,
ChIJE9bjkdcnQg0R7TK_jz2Pki8,5,"Really love this place. A hidden gem of Madrid with Andalucian vibes. Clean, with great services and friendly staff. Tasty food at affordable prices. Great variety of dishes and tapas. Good deal for the table of four toasts. I would recommend to make a reservation or be there before 13:00."
ChIJE9bjkdcnQg0R7TK_jz2Pki8,5,"Very nice atmosphere, very friendly service, lots of food with your drinks included. The food is high-quality too! I say this as a Canadian with mediocre Spanish. I really enjoyed my time here and will be back."
ChIJE9bjkdcnQg0R7TK_jz2Pki8,5,Amazingly delicious tapas! The place looks small and full when you enter but go in anyway. They have more place at downstairs. It is a very local place and they don‚Äôt have English menu. You need to use translation tools to order also :) the vegetarian options are limited but so delicious! The one with caramelised onion is a bless for the mouth!!
ChIJE9bjkdcnQg0R7TK_jz2Pki8,5,"We were a group of six and went there around seven in the evening without reservation and got a table without a problem. The place seems small but it has another room downstairs where you can sit. The waitress was really nice and suggested us to try their specialty which hate their sandwiches.
So we each choose a different kind to try as many as possible and we weren‚Äôt disappointed. The bread was huge for the price and everyone of them was delicious. To drink we all hat either a soda or beer. They don‚Äôt have Radler there but they gently offered to mix it themselves with a lemonade.
All in all a great place for tapas at a low price and with very good taste. Will definitely come back!"
ChIJE9bjkdcnQg0R7TK_jz2Pki8,5,Amazing tapas 10/10 best tapas in Madrid !! But the waiter wasn‚Äôt amazing so 4/5 ! Still highly recommended ! Bacalao ahumedo is the best !!!
ChIJRXZebXgoQg0Ry_pFQrgtbwo,2,"Terribly rude waitress who refused to give our table a drinks menu or offer any information about what cocktails were available. The outdoor seating is nice but the same as every other bar in the plaza, the gin tonic arrived without any lime or garnish just tonic water and gin basically. Also the choice was limited in terms of drinks."
ChIJRXZebXgoQg0Ry_pFQrgtbwo,5,"Tio Tim√≥n is one of my favorite spots in the center of Madrid. Juanjo, the chef and owner, makes creative Spanish cuisine but only using the absolute best ingredients. Tomatoes from the garden, fresh vegetables, amazing local cheeses and so on. Ask about the specials of the day and experience seasonal Spain at its best."
ChIJRXZebXgoQg0Ry_pFQrgtbwo,5,"Hey everyone, I'm tend to be super picky with everything but this place is such an experience in Madrid. The plaza is just beautiful and the bar inside very cosy. Staff are so nice! Honestly, it's a must in Madrid!"
ChIJRXZebXgoQg0Ry_pFQrgtbwo,2,"We waited 45-50 minutes for our food to arrive even though I ordered something simple and the restaurant was only half full. Food was good, I ordered a wok but overpriced for the quantity in my opinion."
ChIJRXZebXgoQg0Ry_pFQrgtbwo,5,"Fantastic food, and a living room away from home for me.
Very friendly and nice staff."
ChIJb-Oth9cnQg0RTj-q3iNAOxc,4,"We were watching the dramatized experience with a tasting of 2 glasses of wine, accompanied by 2 tapas (cod and ham with wild wild animals). All good. Very funny play. There are also some projections related to the world of wine. The place is large and very well decorated. Highly recommended"
ChIJb-Oth9cnQg0RTj-q3iNAOxc,5,"We organized a meeting to present a product with future clients and chose Vinotium to present it, along with a ham cutting workshop and a wine face.
The result far exceeded our expectations. There are two Victors on the team, each one better, a personalized service, taking care of the details, very professional and very friendly. The tasting was done by Pedro, if the experience until Pedro arrived had been excellent, Pedro (sommelier) elevated it to the heavens, close, friendly, with a lot of knowledge of what he was talking about, answering all the questions brilliantly, connected with the clients...impressive.
Our future clients left delighted and we were amazed and happy.
Thanks to the Vinotium team for doing things so well."
ChIJb-Oth9cnQg0RTj-q3iNAOxc,5,We have really enjoyed the wines and Isabel's master class. All lovely! A 10!
ChIJb-Oth9cnQg0RTj-q3iNAOxc,1,"Terrible and slow service, at least on the terrace
Only one waiter on the terrace
After more than half an hour waiting for a portion of calamari we had to ask for the bill and look for another place
*Not recommended*"
ChIJb-Oth9cnQg0RTj-q3iNAOxc,5,In my life I have eaten more delicious Iberian torreznos and so well served
ChIJUb4a7XUoQg0RqMEL1xTBD54,4,"Great value daily offer for 13 Euro (2 dish+ dessert + drink). Food was pretty great. Loved the flan but the chocolate cake was on the sweet side. Lentil soup was great, but not the biggest fan the fish ( a bit dry)."
ChIJUb4a7XUoQg0RqMEL1xTBD54,5,"The food is excellent!
Andres  is great helpful."
ChIJUb4a7XUoQg0RqMEL1xTBD54,5,"Walked in here by chance and we are sure this will be our new local :). Great, casual atmosphere, friendly service and super delicious and fresh food!"
ChIJUb4a7XUoQg0RqMEL1xTBD54,3,"Generally, it was ok. A bit loud on outside spot, and also, you pay an extra 1‚Ç¨ for each dish. Food was not astonishing. If you're hungry, go for it. Otherwise, try sth else ;)"
ChIJUb4a7XUoQg0RqMEL1xTBD54,5,"The staff seemed friendly. They also didn't seem concerned when we showed up with a 2 and an 8 year old. We ordered a few burgers, a ham salad and some potato's with a spicy sauce on top. All was delicious!"
ChIJYe7XbdgnQg0RHHp9m7yUtvA,1,It is no longer there!!
ChIJYe7XbdgnQg0RHHp9m7yUtvA,5,The best stew in Madrid by far. The people who attended us were charming. We feel at home. We will definitely return every Friday. Exquisite house wine.
ChIJYe7XbdgnQg0RHHp9m7yUtvA,5,"A great place. We had a great time, they organized a family meal for us and we ate very delicious. Always very friendly."
ChIJYe7XbdgnQg0RHHp9m7yUtvA,5,"I repeat, it is a spectacular place. Their cuisine surprises me every time I go. Great market cuisine, a cozy, quiet and different place. Thank you!"
ChIJYe7XbdgnQg0RHHp9m7yUtvA,5,"Very good, they prepare catering for birthdays and parties, cooking courses and more."
ChIJCZfTXdcnQg0Rej1X1QAVF_I,5,"Telepizza in Madrid is a great option for a quick and tasty meal. The menu offers a variety of pizzas with generous toppings and well-balanced flavors. I tried the Four Cheese pizza, which was delicious with its creamy blend of cheeses.

The delivery service is prompt and reliable, ensuring your pizza arrives hot and fresh. While the dine-in experience is basic and functional, it's perfect for a casual meal or takeaway."
ChIJCZfTXdcnQg0Rej1X1QAVF_I,5,The pizza was almost 6‚Ç¨. I had pepperoni & it was delish üòã
ChIJCZfTXdcnQg0Rej1X1QAVF_I,1,"I‚Äòve ordered 3 family pizzas through Glovo and it was an absolute nightmare! Cold, zero taste and it arrived 45 minutes later than I was told. Your cheese is disgusting!"
ChIJCZfTXdcnQg0Rej1X1QAVF_I,1,Made a delivery order online and the pizza never came. Extremely disappointed! Do not order from the website!!
ChIJCZfTXdcnQg0Rej1X1QAVF_I,1,"If I could leave 0 starts, I would.

Ordered a pizza and never had it delivered to us. ü•¥"
ChIJMbyzG9gnQg0RtxFS37bca-U,5,"What an incredible meal! The tacos, quesadilla, drinks, chips, salsa, everything was phenomenal! Hands down one of the best Mexican meals we have ever had. The staff were friendly and efficient, prices reasonable, and honestly a meal we loved so much, we are going back for seconds next time we are in Madrid!

You can taste the love and passion in their incredible dishes. Five stars across board!"
ChIJMbyzG9gnQg0RtxFS37bca-U,5,"This is by far the most authentic and delicious Mexican restaurant in Europe. No crowded, hard-to-eat Tex-Mex food, but actually Mexican food as you would find on the streets of Ciudad de Mexico. The only downside would be the lack of a proper hot sauce; their hottest is mild at most. But the flavour of the tacos are making up for everything, and what could be better than having a Dos Equis with your tacos in Madrid?

Just go here!"
ChIJMbyzG9gnQg0RtxFS37bca-U,5,Uff great nachos sauces!! Very good mexican food.  Missed the burritos and other mexican goodies but the tacos were great.
ChIJMbyzG9gnQg0RtxFS37bca-U,5,"The food is very good and you get a lot for the price. They also have a great selection of cocktails and the Ambiente is top. We choose the starter and it was huge, as you can see in the picture and delicious. You also get nachos with two different sauces at the beginning. We will definitely visit again!"
ChIJMbyzG9gnQg0RtxFS37bca-U,4,"On a Sunday night when few other restaurants were open, we found this place just steps from our rental apartment and were very pleasantly surprised by our experience.  The food was excellent and the service was warm and welcoming.  The restaurant has a kitschy ambiance which we found quite charming.  Happy to recommend this place."
ChIJG_5O_XcoQg0RgfD1S6IngHg,5,Great tapas and more
ChIJG_5O_XcoQg0RgfD1S6IngHg,4,"Castiza tavern on Bail√©n street very close to the famous La Latina area. The toasts and empanadas are excellent. The revolconas potatoes deserve a mention, as they go very well with the wines from the good selection they have by the glass. The staff is very friendly and the area is a must when visiting the center of Madrid."
ChIJG_5O_XcoQg0RgfD1S6IngHg,5,Great quality of products and better service. Spectacular salmorejo. Empanada... amazing. Great omelet...Thank you always for making us feel at home.
ChIJG_5O_XcoQg0RgfD1S6IngHg,5,A great place in the center of Madrid. It is small but very cute to snack on. Very good quality-price ratio. A discovery.
ChIJG_5O_XcoQg0RgfD1S6IngHg,5,"One of the best tapas bars in Latin America. Small, cozy and with excellent qualities. It is essential to order the salmorejo portion. Rods shot wonderfully, as the canons dictate. And if it seems like it's closing soon, we have the counter club in front to continue the party"
ChIJEYt2xnkoQg0RBKz7_qEEHqw,5,I had my first ever Men√∫ del d√≠a here and it was lovely. My companions and I enjoyed all the dishes (delicious and filling). It was worth every penny. üíñ
ChIJEYt2xnkoQg0RBKz7_qEEHqw,3,"We stopped here for lunch in early May after sightseeing at the Royal Palace. My husband and I decided to get the menu of the day, ‚Ç¨14 if you're seated inside, ‚Ç¨15 if you're seated on the terrace. It was unusually cool that day so we dined inside.

There were only locals at the restaurant which was nice. We had a bit of a challenge ordering because we don't speak Spanish, even with Google Translate. The server was very patient and kind and did her best to translate the menu.

The menu of the day comes with 2 courses, bread, wine, and a choice of either dessert or coffee. For our first course we got the mixed paella which contained rice, mussels, chicken, and pork. Unfortunately, the rice was undercooked (rice should not be crunchy) and very bland. For our second course, we had pork stew with french fries, which was unfortunately also bland. We both ordered red wine. For dessert, my husband got the apple pie (more like an apple tarte) and I got the flan. Overall, a disappointing meal."
ChIJEYt2xnkoQg0RBKz7_qEEHqw,4,"It‚Äôs good value overall, the food is nice and the setting is average. Good value for $16 you can get a three course meal but prob would return here, way better options in the area"
ChIJEYt2xnkoQg0RBKz7_qEEHqw,5,"My favorite lunch spot in Madrid. Just far enough from the touristy spots to feel local. Daily specials are wonderful and a nice value. Staff are very friendly and helpful, too."
ChIJEYt2xnkoQg0RBKz7_qEEHqw,5,"Nothing beat 14 Euro, 3 courses lunch combo, salad, tomato sauce pasta, ice cream for kids, coffee for grownup, can not be wrong!"
ChIJaX_j9ncoQg0RH3K4brE1gi0,1,"We came today to drink beers. Waitress took our order, then left and didn‚Äôt bring us beer. She came back in 10 -15 mins and took our order again. Then left. We waited ~25 more mins and then she tried to take order from us again, the third time!! So, we never got our order..
It was very frustrating. I think she was high or something"
ChIJaX_j9ncoQg0RH3K4brE1gi0,5,Wonderful place - very local!
ChIJaX_j9ncoQg0RH3K4brE1gi0,5,"If you want to have drinks with a view, this is your place. Definitely recommend it"
ChIJaX_j9ncoQg0RH3K4brE1gi0,5,Love this spot. The outside has a great view of a beautiful bridge (lit up at night until 11pm). Inside is quirky in a great way.
ChIJaX_j9ncoQg0RH3K4brE1gi0,4,"Outside views, I took a San Francisco cocktail with vodka, nod bad but prices a bit high, nonetheless attention I great and barman know what he do.

Nice space for summer and to practice language exchange."
ChIJ4aN-n9cnQg0RpdZHGWWfrho,5,"We visited El Bomb√≠n for some tapas and a few beers. The tapas were superb along with the atmosphere. We ordered the house special Torrezno ib√©rico, which was crispy, juicy and bursting with flavour. The bar is situated in the La Latina neighborhood and is very popular amongst the locals."
ChIJ4aN-n9cnQg0RpdZHGWWfrho,5,"Great food, great vibes, great staff. The bar is situated in the heart of La Latina, but away from May tourist. Very traditional! Andrian looked after myself & my friend who were in Madrid for 4 days! Great selections of wine, served with a smile! Don‚Äôt think twice and go and enjoy! Thank you Andrian for being a great host along with all your staff!

We can‚Äôt wait to see you again soon üòä"
ChIJ4aN-n9cnQg0RpdZHGWWfrho,4,"Good food but poor service quality.
Waiters kind of impolite"
ChIJ4aN-n9cnQg0RpdZHGWWfrho,5,"We went there twice.  Once for the menu of the day and once for a Saturday mid afternoon meal.  Juan, one of the owner's sons,  was so kind to us.  The food was very good and we loved the atmosphere."
ChIJ4aN-n9cnQg0RpdZHGWWfrho,5,My favourite place in Madrid so far! The food is beyond good and the staff is super friendly. The octopus was delicious.
ChIJrY2ssWQoQg0RiMPAnMmAsiM,5,"Local fresh good food, low prices, fast sevice.
We took the daily lunch menu for 11eur, including starters, Main, cold drink and desert or coffee. The tomato soup was to die for, the chicken breasts is actually 1/4 of a whole chicken and the orange-almods cake. All were a delight. Main crowd is locals, and the dishes have a ""home made"" touch. Great place for good local food."
ChIJrY2ssWQoQg0RiMPAnMmAsiM,5,"I don‚Äôt usually do reviews, however this cozy place with Hispanic food has encouraged me. I especially recommend the daily specials as for 12‚Ç¨ you get main dish, starter, drink and coffee."
ChIJrY2ssWQoQg0RiMPAnMmAsiM,4,I took the day menu and I was very happy. Great price/quality. Super fast service! The food was good!
ChIJrY2ssWQoQg0RiMPAnMmAsiM,4,"Good men√∫ @ 12‚Ç¨
Better for its terrace/cervecita time..
Wasn't into the bacalao Frito but artichokes & beef can't go wrong. Nice cafecito..

Location wise by the mercado, nice that's it's away from & tucked away from Gran Via.. Chill atmosphere"
ChIJrY2ssWQoQg0RiMPAnMmAsiM,5,"Great vegan place! Everything was delicious. Nice inside, and, if it's warm enough, you can sit outside on a lovely plaza. It's popular -- be sure to reserve a table in advance!"
ChIJNXrQbNcnQg0R1Hk2QIbvM6o,5,"Small, cute taberna. We got the manchego semi curado, a tomato salad, gilda and stuffed pickle. Delicious. The vermut is on tap and the cava is crisp."
ChIJNXrQbNcnQg0R1Hk2QIbvM6o,5,"Amazing place, food is incredible and the staff are lovely. They have a great selection of Spanish cheeses"
ChIJNXrQbNcnQg0R1Hk2QIbvM6o,5,"Cute little tapas bar! Loved the tapas that we ordered. I will never be able to forget the tomato salad that we ordered, it was the sweetest, freshest, juiciest tomatoes I've ever had, perfectly paired with quality olive oil, feta and olives."
ChIJNXrQbNcnQg0R1Hk2QIbvM6o,5,"Excellent food in a narrow and authentic tapas bar in La Latina. The service wasn‚Äôt the best but honestly the food made up for it. The tomatoes were amazing , as were the toasts - we tried the sardines & the mushroom toast. Sadly they were out of fresh asparagus, wouldn‚Äôt recommend getting the canned ones which we tried for."
ChIJNXrQbNcnQg0R1Hk2QIbvM6o,5,"Very authentic Spanish feel in a busy place filled with locals and few tourists. Busy for lunch and whole evening.
Very good selection of cheese, wine and charcuterie for Spanish taste experience.

Lovely host staff, lovely vibe, easy to start a conversation with other people while standing by the long Spanish style bar counter or sitting at a small table.

You have can choose your tastes from tapas menu, cheese menu, daily menu or just ask for most delicious tomato with olive oil and salt.

Rather quite street but luckily well hidden for tourist masses üëåüèª"
ChIJAQAAANEnQg0Rcw34ZGMm4mc,5,"Excellent service, beautiful cocktails carefully crafted, best chilaquiles on this side of the Atlantic. Gets busy and we were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar. Staff is professional, friendly and welcoming. Cocktail menu tells a great story, you can tell they‚Äôve thought about this and put their heart into it."
ChIJAQAAANEnQg0Rcw34ZGMm4mc,5,"Love this place! Banging Mexican cocktail bar. Top service, an unreal selection of Mezcals and Tequilas, all expertly hand crafted into delicious concoctions.
All the dishes I've tried here have been brilliant too. Highly recommended if you're partial to your  Mexican spirits and your Margaritas."
ChIJAQAAANEnQg0Rcw34ZGMm4mc,5,"This spot boasts one of the best agave spirit selections in the world. It‚Äôs intimate, almost too small for its own good, so plan ahead and arrive early.

The staff is as sharp as the spirits they pour, with Roberto standing out as a highlight. His knowledge runs deep, turning every pour into a lesson in craftsmanship and culture. He‚Äôs the kind of guy who makes you think about what‚Äôs in your glass‚Äîand why it matters.

The selection? Impeccable. The vibe? Effortlessly authentic. And the margarita challenge? Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôll test more than your taste buds.

This isn‚Äôt just a bar; it‚Äôs a love letter to Mexico."
ChIJAQAAANEnQg0Rcw34ZGMm4mc,5,"Nice groovy vibes and great attending by their staff who took their time to explain the menu and gave us advice for our drinks.

You can tell by their wide Agave selection of spirits and the menu desing that they oit a lot of caring and time on their work"
ChIJAQAAANEnQg0Rcw34ZGMm4mc,5,"Felt like back home üíú got a bit nostalgic by finding such a great mezcal selection, yummy Mexican food (not Tex-Mex cr‚Ä¶ap) and the genuine warmth of the Mexican bartenders. Definitely worth a visit: good drinks, good prices n good vibe! highly recommended !!! üíÄüá≤üáΩüíÄ"
ChIJLSw0ztcnQg0RLqULEGTkVZA,5,"On February 20th, my sister and I had dinner at this restaurant in the Latin Quarter. The restaurant has a spacious terrace, but it was chilly, so we dined inside. The waiter set the table with a white tablecloth, and all his service was top notch, he is a professional waiter who tries to please customers. We asked his name - his name is Karel. Thanks to Karel for very good service. The food was good, but I chose a slightly specific dish for myself. We will give 10 points out of 10 for the service, and 8-9 for the food. I advise other tourists to visit this place."
ChIJLSw0ztcnQg0RLqULEGTkVZA,5,"Menu del dia brought us gazpacho, roast swordfish with a beautiful salad, wine, bread,
dessert and coffee. Quiet setting under umbrellas. All for ‚Ç¨15. Recommend!"
ChIJLSw0ztcnQg0RLqULEGTkVZA,5,"Everything was fantastic. Karel, our server, took really good care of us and explained the menu. Dishes were authentic and well executed."
ChIJLSw0ztcnQg0RLqULEGTkVZA,5,I totallyrecommend the brunch (Menu el dia).  It was very delicious and the guys are absolutely friendly and the prices absolutely fair. Give them guys a chance.
ChIJLSw0ztcnQg0RLqULEGTkVZA,2,"Food is decent but service is terrible, I don‚Äôt recommend this place.

We asked for a table around 5pm for some tapas and beers, and the older waiter told us that we couldn‚Äôt have a seat unless we ordered at least 3 tapas or 2 mains (we were two people).

It was very weird to us, especially considering that many tables were free and all the seated customers were only drinking, no one was actually eating.

We asked another waiter and he told us to not listen to his colleague, and to have a seat, but in a rude manner.

When we took a seat we waited around 10 minutes for someone to take our order. In the end the older waiter came and was extremely rude, not even looking at us, and pushing us to order more food.

When the order came they brought us the patatas bravas, which were ok, but didn‚Äôt bring the olives that we asked. We never got them.

Also, at some point while eating the waiter came and took the outdoor heater from us to give it to another table of customers who just arrived, without saying anything.

If you‚Äôre looking for a nice atmosphere, don‚Äôt go there."
ChIJk_YW39YnQg0RVqIXPjLWprI,5,"This is an amazing restaurant that you definitly should go! First of all, the people are great! Very cool and pleasant, always smiling. And the food, oh my good, it is so tasty that I can't describle in words... so much flavor!"
ChIJk_YW39YnQg0RVqIXPjLWprI,3,"The place is simple.
The staff is not really friendly but doing their job.
Food is average, nothing special to mention or recommend.
Prices are cheap and not expensive."
ChIJk_YW39YnQg0RVqIXPjLWprI,3,"I enjoyed my beef kabob sandwich with fries, and choice of cold drink."
ChIJk_YW39YnQg0RVqIXPjLWprI,5,"Simple but delicious! Traditional kebabs, nice chips, good service, great prices. Meals are large too. Highly recommend."
ChIJk_YW39YnQg0RVqIXPjLWprI,4,"Decent price for kabab on its own, tastes good too"
ChIJsWnfy9cnQg0R-XzxeWyXfB8,2,"They have a completely vegan option for 4,5 euros or you can sub the flesh on any hotdog for a cruelty free option for 1,5 euro up charge, but be careful to make sure all toppings are plant based as well. I played it safe with the imposter. Pretty bland, but cheap quick snack if you‚Äôre out late."
ChIJsWnfy9cnQg0R-XzxeWyXfB8,5,"Super glad with the service. We enjoyed a lot those wonderful hotdogs. Thanks again to Alex and Adonis for their service! We will definitely go back.

PS: free sauces are the best."
ChIJsWnfy9cnQg0R-XzxeWyXfB8,4,"Hot dog chain that sells a variety of hot dogs with a whole range of toppings. Very well known brand and the service is excellent
They make them fresh to order and are open late. Great place to grab a quick hot snack and very good value"
ChIJsWnfy9cnQg0R-XzxeWyXfB8,5,"best hot dog in town!!!
also comes in vegan versionüôèüí™
and the girl who works the night shift sooo polite n happy all the timeü´∂
i was in town for couple of days n was coming every night back for this experience!!!
thanx again"
ChIJsWnfy9cnQg0R-XzxeWyXfB8,5,"I was going to walk 20+ minutes to gamble on a restaurant, walked by this place and the 4.9 rating is spot on, reasonably priced, delicious, fast and hits the spot. Like the other reviews say, you won't be disappointed."
ChIJ9UjhtNcnQg0Rhk8ZayZ5Gr8,5,"Came here for the first time, highly recommend it by local friends and love it!
The tortilla‚Äôs menu was amazing. Definitely coming back next time in Madrid."
ChIJ9UjhtNcnQg0Rhk8ZayZ5Gr8,4,"Great place to enjoy an authentic tortilla experience in Madrid la Latina. They serve a variety of Spanish omelettes, with some vegetarian options as well. The place is lively and warmly decorated, and most peoples are locals Spaniards. They welcomed me with a complimentary cheese and marmalade‚Äôs pintxo and I had the mini (yet quite large for 1 person) tortilla with goat cheese and caramelised onions (9.85‚Ç¨) and a glass of la Rioja wine (3‚Ç¨), in total ~13‚Ç¨. I don‚Äôt quite understand the necessity of a big bouncer by the entry, that made me a bit unease, but‚Ä¶"
ChIJ9UjhtNcnQg0Rhk8ZayZ5Gr8,4,"Quite nice selection of Spanish Food! A lot of choices for different variations of Spanish Tortilla - you can order a big one or a small one. As well, really nice croquettas with jambon. Service was fairly quick"
ChIJ9UjhtNcnQg0Rhk8ZayZ5Gr8,4,"The ambience is very nice and the staff is friendly. We tried the tortilhas with shrimp and it was really good. For us it was missing a bit of salt so we asked for it. After putting a bit more salt, it became delicious. I believe it is a good place to try the tortilhas.

I recommend this place."
ChIJ9UjhtNcnQg0Rhk8ZayZ5Gr8,5,"A very lively and popular bar serving excellent Tortilla. Full of Spanish, we were lucky to get a seat as shortly after I took my photos it was full to the brim with people being turned away.
Friendly and efficient service with an excellent local beer and wine selection.
We made the tourist mistake of not asking for a slice of tortilla as they brought a whole one and my wife and I could only manage half of it, mind you it only cost 8 Euro."
ChIJW1Vly9cnQg0RT3TnfpCfXdY,3,Steak was totally cold and unevenly grilled.    Rest of the dishes were OK.  Toilets can‚Äôt be locked and are dirty and without toilet paper.   All-in-all a mediocre experience.
ChIJW1Vly9cnQg0RT3TnfpCfXdY,2,"I ordered the ribs, expecting a satisfying meal, but what I got was a disappointment. The dish consisted mostly of fat and bones, with barely any meat. On top of that, the taste was underwhelming, making it far from worth the price. Definitely not something I would recommend."
ChIJW1Vly9cnQg0RT3TnfpCfXdY,5,"We ordered the zucchini sticks to start. They were sweet and crisp and a generous portion. More than enough for 4 people to share. I had the grilled squid with black ink rice.  Also very delicious.
The service was also great.  Our server was pleasant and our food was delivered in a decent time.  Very nice atmosphere."
ChIJW1Vly9cnQg0RT3TnfpCfXdY,5,"An excellent little restaurant mainly patronised by the locals. We visited twice during our few days in Madrid. The service is excellent and the food very good, serving good local wine.
On our second visit for some reason the cheaper local menu wasn‚Äôt available and the different waiters weren‚Äôt as attentive or friendly. Maybe too much of a good thing, one visit may have been sufficient."
ChIJW1Vly9cnQg0RT3TnfpCfXdY,1,I would have given 0 stars is they had it for the food. This was the cheese tapas and stale dry packaged breadsticks. HORRIBLE! We are still here waiting for our cheque.
ChIJAcTDU9YnQg0RQPklD7azVhk,5,"Very nice little bar/restaurant with only a few small tables in the back. In the bar-area are a few high tables. The interior is cozy and well designed. Staff is very friendly. The food is great. Good hummus and bread with among others, a perfect hamburger, super pulled pork and spicy turkey. Not expensive. Had a perfect meal, with drinks, with 4, for ‚Ç¨ 50.=. Highly recommended. It's best to reserve a table."
ChIJAcTDU9YnQg0RQPklD7azVhk,5,"We popped in here by chance on our way to a nearby gig. Great cosy atmosphere and equally good service. Quality cocktails...... wine, beer and vermut! What more do you want? We never ate but the food looked amazing too.
We also went back after the gig... and it was even better ;-)"
ChIJAcTDU9YnQg0RQPklD7azVhk,5,"i loved the place! delicious food, especially the mix of fried potatoes. the best potatoes i've had in my life, really üòã they have a burger with avocado paste, i liked it a LOT. and a cool menu too. our server was smily and nice, she spoke English too, which is a good bonus here. they gave us candy at the end which was so sweet in both meanings ‚ô•Ô∏è"
ChIJAcTDU9YnQg0RQPklD7azVhk,5,I had the pork nachos and pork burger. Very good. If getting anything from here I recommend the pork. Very tasty and went well with everything else. Every bite I took was savory.. I had to cherish every moment as if it were my last. What if I never get to bite into this again? I couldn‚Äôt waste that opportunity.
ChIJAcTDU9YnQg0RQPklD7azVhk,5,"Pajaritos Mojados is a wonderful place to either grab a bite or just a cocktail with friends. They have a great menu of different sandwiches (including vegetarian options), and amazing sides like their Batatas with spicy sauce.

Their cocktails are very good and generous, and they have a good variety of tequila and mezcal as well.

They also have a sandwich of the month with this month was Fried Calamari, and it was wonderful!"
ChIJi3z3MtYnQg0Rv6XGs3-c994,5,"Delicious tortillas and croquettes for great value. The service was excellent and friendly. It can be a challenge to find seating inside as there aren't many tables, however it's normal to eat whilst standing at the bar. Would definitely recommend this place."
ChIJi3z3MtYnQg0Rv6XGs3-c994,5,"Had our first Spanish tortilla of the trip and wow did it set the bar high! It's a crowded place and may be hard to find seats but it's exactly the right vibe for a tapas bar. Also the staff was super kind and helpful, even though our Spanish is not so great."
ChIJi3z3MtYnQg0Rv6XGs3-c994,4,"a popular bar with various kinds of not only tortilla but also craft beers. we went around 9pm and it was super crowded, almost became a standing bar.
tortilla was nice but could be less salty."
ChIJi3z3MtYnQg0Rv6XGs3-c994,5,Nice place to dine in different varieties of egg  dishes with very cheep price in Madrid. Near the city center. Always crowded need to wait for the space. Nice service friendly staff.
ChIJi3z3MtYnQg0Rv6XGs3-c994,5,"We have tried 3 tortillas - the one with parmesan was tasteless, the other 2 were amazing. I know this chain of bars all over Madrid and in whichever you are it is always full, with great, vivid atmosphere. They serve good spanish tortilla and worldwide beers ;-)"
ChIJ-_tlr3goQg0R1wC7VqTxtd8,5,"This is really a great hotel to stay in. I think the reviews are mixed with the one of their restaurants, but it truly deserves more than a 4.2 stars average.

The room was big and super cozy. The shower was amazing (really good pressure). Heated floors all around the room and good AC if needed. I took the breakfast option and even with a small selection, everything was really great (freshly pressed orange juice, eggs made to order, cheese selection and great coffee).

Don't hesitate to book this hotel, the location is A1 and the staff was super friendly too!"
ChIJ-_tlr3goQg0R1wC7VqTxtd8,2,"I got Bed Bugs! I understand that sometimes it happens. This was my first experience. What is so disturbing is I reported it in the morning. I sent pictures of the bugs in the bed and my bites. No one has contacted me yet. I have even reached out again. No response.
The building is beautiful."
ChIJ-_tlr3goQg0R1wC7VqTxtd8,5,"Great location, in the center of La Latina and close to the Plaza Mayor. This hotel has confortable rooms (we had an upgrade to a spacious family rooms). Only downside is that the water in the shower takes a lot of time to heat up. Every thing else was fine."
ChIJ-_tlr3goQg0R1wC7VqTxtd8,5,"A great find. It is a small boutique hotel with comfortable rooms (excellent bed), delightful and helpful staff (particularly Daniella), contemporary fixtures and very good breakfast and restaurant (try the croquettes). Good value. The neighborhood couldn't be better, with many restaurants and bars, a nearby supermarket, short walk  to Plaza Mayor, Plaza del Sol and the La Latina Metro station. Highly recommended."
ChIJ-_tlr3goQg0R1wC7VqTxtd8,1,"The staff were lovely and the rooms were nice and clean, but they are wrapped around a restaurant in a courtyard. I was there for one evening to sleep before an early flight, and people were still talking and cleaning until after midnight so I was exhausted. I asked to get another room but they said they were booked up and to email. On emailing they said I would get no compensation as I should have told someone I wasn‚Äôt happy on the night - which I did. A hotel is essentially supposed to provide someone a room they can sleep in, which I could not."
ChIJa6hrhismQg0RuO0t8lwVOps,5,"We went only for some beers and the gentlemen working there were really nice.
With every round of beers they brought us some tapas free that we really enjoyed. Definitely will visit again If we are in Madrid."
ChIJa6hrhismQg0RuO0t8lwVOps,4,Great cider and Asturian food! Service was fast and the oyster mushrooms in blue cheese sauce great. The cachopo was meaty but not remarkable in flavor - more or less beef snitzel.
ChIJa6hrhismQg0RuO0t8lwVOps,1,It‚Äôs annoying how sometimes when they see that you‚Äôre foreign they don‚Äôt give you an appetitive like how they give everyone else. It‚Äôs giving selective and racist. I had to finally ask to get this which they were giving other people freely
ChIJa6hrhismQg0RuO0t8lwVOps,4,"Exceptionally friendly and efficient staff, offering quality food at reasonable prices and their portion sizes are huge! We ordered a portion of croquetas and patatas bravas which were perfectly done and tasty, highly recommended! They are also quite generous with their tapas offered with ca√±as.

The only negative thing I could say was that our outdoor table was rather dirty and could have been wiped / washed clean. But this wouldn't stop me from going again."
ChIJa6hrhismQg0RuO0t8lwVOps,5,Excellent place for authentic Asturian dishes. The Chorizo in Cider was to die for. Definitely will go back.
ChIJf8EaeXkoQg0R2XIp_tPMHwg,4,"We came here seeking french onion soup. It was good; can‚Äôt say the absolute best I‚Äôve ever had, but definitely satisfying. My wife had escargot as a main and was happy. Unfortunately the beef bourguignon was not available that night, so ordered the entrec√¥te instead. It was a bit disappointing‚Ä¶very tough and sinewy."
ChIJf8EaeXkoQg0R2XIp_tPMHwg,5,"Elegant and cosy restaurant in a small attractive side street near the Teatro Real and Opera Metro. I've been looking for years for restaurants which serve the now elusive 'boeuf bourguignon' and 'coq au vin'. I finally found a Parmentier de boeuf bourguignon here and it met all expectations!

We came for a weekday lunch with a thefork discount (otherwise it would have been a lot more expensive). We had a main course each. The 3 thinly cut 'delicias reales' steaks with 3 different pepper sauces were also delicious. For dessert we shared a 'tarte tatin' with icecream. With two glasses of Bordeaux and the discount on the food the bill came to less than 30‚Ç¨ per head."
ChIJf8EaeXkoQg0R2XIp_tPMHwg,5,"Simple words can not express the quality of the food, the excellence of the service and the tastes in this small nice French restaurant in the center of Madrid.

We live in spain more then a year and that's the first time we found this diamond. From the Foie Gras to the 4 cheese salad or tuna fish on the plancha for starters, to Fillet mignon with foie Gras (it was worth twice).

For deserters we had tarta tatin and chocolate mousse cake.

Perfect dinner for special event."
ChIJf8EaeXkoQg0R2XIp_tPMHwg,5,"It's a french styled restaurant and it's really amazing! Everything we tried was absolutely spectacular. The ambiances is very intimate and elegant, perfect for a date or a group of family dinner. They offer a summer and a winter menu (these pictures belong to the summer menu)
Highly recommend it"
ChIJf8EaeXkoQg0R2XIp_tPMHwg,5,"The place is well decorated with its own personality and intimacy. Everything inside gives an old feeling, and it creates great atmospheres. All the dishes were delicious with good quality. I especially love their beef tartare, the flavor was outstanding. Their duck tenderloin and fish were also amazing. We already visited this place more than 5 times. If you come here in the winter, you should try their fresh foie."
ChIJDXN309UnQg0RL1gFC7pdDGk,5,"Talk about a fabulous traditional Madrile√±o dining experience. The hustle and bustle of the dining room, surrounded by history. I wanted my first time having ‚ÄúCocido Madrile√±o‚Äù to be authentic. Malacat√≠n delivered. My husband and I each had ‚ÄúNuestro famoso Cocido Madrile√±o.‚Äù It‚Äôs 25‚Ç¨ / Persona and no you can‚Äôt share one. Be prepared for the massive portion, so go hungry. I have pictured all the various foods that come with the order. You basically create the stew of your choosing or put everything in the broth at once, which I believe is the true way to eat it. It was divine üòã"
ChIJDXN309UnQg0RL1gFC7pdDGk,5,"Felt like a truly classic Madrid spot. Lots of food, really good service, and really cool art on the walls. Lively and delicious, very happy I got a chance to visit!"
ChIJDXN309UnQg0RL1gFC7pdDGk,5,"This is one place you must visit to live the whole traditional food experience from Madrid. Cocido Madrile√±o at its best, perfect traditional atmosphere and the legacy of a 100+ year old restaurant. Booking a table is difficult as there‚Äôs many people looking for one, but you can do the line for a place at the counter (aprox 40 mins) and live the same experience plus asking nice tapas and tasting the Cocido Madrile√±o. Don‚Äôt miss this place!"
ChIJDXN309UnQg0RL1gFC7pdDGk,5,"One of the best meals we had during our trip to Spain. The restaurant is very authentic and has such a long history. Luckily we made a reservation in advance and when we arrived around 7pm all the tables were booked. The stew was simply great with a lot of dishes and generous portion. I can‚Äôt have enough of it, will sure come back next time we are in Madrid."
ChIJDXN309UnQg0RL1gFC7pdDGk,2,"I was really excited to finally try the infamous Madrid stew at Malactin, a well-rated restaurant steeped in history. Sadly, the food quality didn't meet my expectations. The stewed meats were overcooked and dry, and the dish was excessively salty, making it almost inedible. The chickpeas were a highlight, cooked perfectly and soft. I also felt the service could have been more informative. An explanation of how to properly eat the meal, a description of the meats being served, or even a simple written guide on the menu would have been very helpful. We couldn't finish the stew and had a lot left over. I also wish they would reconsider their policy of forcing a per-person charge, as it prevented me from trying other dishes on their menu. On a positive note, I did enjoy the restaurant's decor and atmosphere."
ChIJd2ZOqX8oQg0RF--BwtLE0w8,5,"Amazing food and wine!! Loved the experience with the opera, loved the atmosphere and the service was fantastic. Would recommend at all times."
ChIJd2ZOqX8oQg0RF--BwtLE0w8,4,"atmosphere amazing (an ol dchapel with a lot of history), food ok (not more), but because of the special entourage, 4 stars!"
ChIJd2ZOqX8oQg0RF--BwtLE0w8,1,"Horrible food, poor service and then the music on top of this. Avoid at all times"
ChIJd2ZOqX8oQg0RF--BwtLE0w8,3,"Good starters, not so good main dishes. Overall just ok"
ChIJd2ZOqX8oQg0RF--BwtLE0w8,1,bad food
ChIJS9cdZtUnQg0R0jP2MwQezrM,5,Enrique is the best. He took good care of us!
ChIJS9cdZtUnQg0R0jP2MwQezrM,4,"It's a steakhouse, it's a cafeteria... Or both, it all depends on what you feel like. It is certainly a fairly typical place, located in the Plaza de Tirso de Molina, the service is good and very attentive, its waiters transmit energy and good spirits, you can calmly have an early breakfast in the morning and in addition to the coffee to wake up you will have the spirit and energy of the people who provide you with the service. The price, very comfortable and accessible. I recommend it."
ChIJS9cdZtUnQg0R0jP2MwQezrM,5,"I already knew this restaurant, on this occasion we were celebrating the birthday of one of our friends. They didn't give us any problems over the phone for a group of ten (later we saw that you can also reserve online).

Upon our arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to see that we had been assigned a private room for ourselves where we could be calm and at our leisure.

We chose a tasting menu that consisted of:
- Arizmendi Salad
- Broken eggs
- Meat (Steak) or fish (Monkfish)

We paid a little more than forty per person. I am quite a eater and I didn't exactly stay hungry. I saw that they still have the executive menu, possibly I will go alone one day to try it. Highly recommended."
ChIJS9cdZtUnQg0R0jP2MwQezrM,5,"Red meat makes you drool just by seeing it. As for the menu, it's not bad either, a little bit on the expensive side, but within what's possible (the area and the state of the premises) it's absolutely understandable. For dinners/lunches with more work colleagues or family it is fine, because there are some menus that you obviously won't be able to eat alone XD"
ChIJS9cdZtUnQg0R0jP2MwQezrM,4,"Like a good Basque steakhouse, the meat is excellent, and washed down with a good wine, even better. Order the barbecue, I loved it. The first time I went was with friends and we were all very satisfied. There is a pleasant atmosphere and the decoration is very nice."
ChIJ7TCMcoAoQg0RIFUbAtQnY8M,5,"My family had a good time there. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very upscale and welcoming. It was quite busy the time when we arrived, but the waiter took the time to explain, translate and recommend as we don't speak much Spanish. The presentation of the food is very appetizing and taste very good. Duck confit is amazing. We loved the lamb paella very much. I am not sure whose fault it was, but one of our dishes was mixed up. But the waiter honestly pointed out, and gladly changed it for my kid. We had a good experience and really appreciate the service there."
ChIJ7TCMcoAoQg0RIFUbAtQnY8M,4,We came here on Christmas Eve as all the other places were closeted. The restaurant looked nice but food kinda lacked flavor. The paella didn‚Äôt have many seafood in it and the prawns and mussels didn‚Äôt taste fresh. It‚Äôs definitely not the best paella that I‚Äôve had. The mushroom salad was pretty plain. The sangria didn‚Äôt taste alcohol at all.
ChIJ7TCMcoAoQg0RIFUbAtQnY8M,4,"We had the lunch menu, it was very nice. It feels like a fancy place for a decent price the lunch menu is 15‚Ç¨ includes an entree, main, dessert, bread and a drink. Very good quality for the price."
ChIJ7TCMcoAoQg0RIFUbAtQnY8M,5,Very good resto. Food delicious. Prices reasonable. Very nice atmosphere. Recommended to us at the hotel. I can fully recommend too.
ChIJ7TCMcoAoQg0RIFUbAtQnY8M,4,Food was great! I had grilled salmon and my husband had the chicken and rice. There was a bit of confusion about our order. Staff was friendly and some spoke English.
ChIJmepX4yomQg0RgNvLdNXOPS4,3,Decent food. I ordered a vegetable biryani and dal tadka - its chana dal cooked well with some ghee and cumin tempering. Owner was kind enough to offer free onions and green chillies that most indian restaurants in europe charge for.
ChIJmepX4yomQg0RgNvLdNXOPS4,5,"When you walk into a restaurant and it‚Äôs packed, you know it‚Äôs got to be good! And it sure was! They start your dining experience off by bringing free pappadam with sauces to the table while you look over the menu, and end the meal with a free mango lassi (which is absolutely delicious!) I ordered the butter chicken and it was smooth, buttery, and very mild (if you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs not spicy at all, it‚Äôs perfect!) I also had the pilau rice and cheese naan which were very tasty! Wonderful and friendly service and delicious food!"
ChIJmepX4yomQg0RgNvLdNXOPS4,5,"The food here is so good with several vegan options, authentic, great portions and inexpensive with friendly people especially Kaimu. They even gave us complimentary mango lassi. I liked it so much on first visit that I went again. I highly recommend this restaurant"
ChIJmepX4yomQg0RgNvLdNXOPS4,5,Wonderful service and delicious lamb curry.  Loved the dinner here. Highly recommended üëå
ChIJmepX4yomQg0RgNvLdNXOPS4,5,"Papadam and chutney, samosas, Pakoras, garlic naan, pilau rice, mango lassi, pistachio kulfi ice cream, Phaal curry, and Glacy special hot curry were delicious!"
ChIJs77TMn8oQg0Rx4LzsN0_9lQ,4,"I had a great experience at Taberna La Daniela Cuchilleros on a Sunday evening. The restaurant wasn‚Äôt too full, so I got to enjoy a relaxed atmosphere while sitting at the bar. I ordered callos and croqueta de cocido, and both were absolutely amazing‚Äîrich in flavor and perfectly prepared! I also had a beer and vermut, which paired really well with the food.

Even though I was by myself, I felt very comfortable and enjoyed the experience. If you‚Äôre in Madrid and looking for authentic Spanish flavors, I highly recommend this place!"
ChIJs77TMn8oQg0Rx4LzsN0_9lQ,5,"My favorite restaurant in Madrid! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love everything about it. I come to this place whenever I‚Äôm in Madrid and I always order the same dish - Secreto Ib√©rico."
ChIJs77TMn8oQg0Rx4LzsN0_9lQ,1,Service is so bad that it makes the food taste bad. The worse service I have had in a long time. Both of the waiters were super rude. I guess the Callos were ‚Äúok‚Äù but they didn‚Äôt taste good due to the horrible environment inside this place.
ChIJs77TMn8oQg0Rx4LzsN0_9lQ,2,"The place just opened when we went in, so they were not busy. However the server didn't bother to explain or ask what we may want, or even present the full menu to us, but just asked if we all want three courses of Cocido.

The food had big portions and was very salty. There were a few items that we considered good, but mainly everything was just salty."
ChIJs77TMn8oQg0Rx4LzsN0_9lQ,5,"After a long stroll through La Latina we found this nice restaurant on the way back to the Plaza Mayor.
We ordered patata bravas, blood sausage, the chickpea stew and octopus. Everything tasted delicious and the octopus was perfectly executed.

Usually I use salt scarcely in my cooking. Especially the octopus was a little bit too salty for me (but still delicious!). But this is not an issue with this place alone. Like I mentioned I use little salt in general and I had the feeling that the local cuisine in madrid uses more salt than other countries (I visited so far).
I just wanted to make clear that this is a personal opinion and I'd still visit the Taberna de La Daniela again. I would probably ask for less salt where it can be avoided. But like I said this means every restaurant we went to during our stay in madrid.

Our waiter was friendly and understood englisch without issue. I quite like the ambience because of the traditional setting with the colored tiles and so on.
I think we paid around 50 euro for our meal incl Sangria.

We had a nice evening and can recommend the place."
ChIJoRuHx2QoQg0RKzxCG7Ku0j8,3,"Food was 3 stars, service was 2 stars. Food wasn't out of the ordinary. The ceviche had too much msg in it. But the fish seemed fresh enough. The chicharrones we're very fatty (much more than typical). We ordered it but the waiter claimed he didn't hear the order so it took 45mina to get it. And we never got water. The wine was good though."
ChIJoRuHx2QoQg0RKzxCG7Ku0j8,5,"Delicious Peruvian food. From the menu del d√≠a I almost always go for ceviche and lomo saltado with a glass of chicha. The aj√≠ is really good and spicy too to add some extra flair to the food. The staff is very nice and attentive, this can be a good place for either a quick meal or a long lunch. You can tell that a lot of emphasis is put into the quality of the ingredients and the food is very consistent each time."
ChIJoRuHx2QoQg0RKzxCG7Ku0j8,4,Authentically peruvian! Great portion sizes and delicious exotic flavours. Love their ceviche and pisco sours! The yuquitas (cassava) are also worth a shot!
ChIJoRuHx2QoQg0RKzxCG7Ku0j8,5,"Nice place with a very professional staff. Food was terrific.
Bit pricy for the zone but the service and food makes it worth it."
ChIJoRuHx2QoQg0RKzxCG7Ku0j8,5,Really nice Peruvian restaurant. Food is high quality and delicious. Must try!
ChIJWeLWq3goQg0RTKBswSaAe5Q,4,"Had lunch here. Had cochinillo and Callos. Cochinillo‚Äôs skin was very crunchy and tasty. Problem was after several bites, one feels the oiliness in your mouth. We also ordered the Callos. That was very good. We enjoyed it very much. The servers were attentive and helpful . My only problem was we were given a bad table. We were near the steps going into the restrooms and everyone someone climbed it, we could hear the footsteps. Good thing we ate early and finished before the lunch crowd came.

If you want authentic good Spanish food , try out this restaurant"
ChIJWeLWq3goQg0RTKBswSaAe5Q,5,"The food was very good. The portions were enormous! We ordered 5 tapas to share between the two of us (would have easily fed 4-5).  In retrospect, 2 or 3 tapas would have been more than enough. The cod was amazing but was easily a full meal by itself. The same can be said for the pulpo. Needless to say, we left VERY full and there was still food for 2 more people."
ChIJWeLWq3goQg0RTKBswSaAe5Q,5,"We were visiting Madrid for the weekend and decided to book this restaurant for dinner. I couldn‚Äôt make a better choice, everything was very good: the food was delicious, the wine was good, the staff was polite and attentive and the interior is very interesting decorated. The food we choose:  jamon de bellota, jamon croquettee and their speciality suckling pig. Definitely a place to come again."
ChIJWeLWq3goQg0RTKBswSaAe5Q,5,An excellent national Spanish restaurant with a diverse cuisine.
ChIJWeLWq3goQg0RTKBswSaAe5Q,5,"The best tapas, best service and best traditional atmosphere. Thank you so much"
ChIJNfglqXgoQg0Rjj0YFs3NdmM,5,"I went there on a Saturday evening for dinner. The place is beautiful, great atmosphere and perfect service. Prices per person is 100‚Ç¨ formula. But it offers a big quantity of food. High quality place in la Latina. The place is 2 floors, big space and amazing interior. The staff specially Javier are amazing and helpful. Well recommended."
ChIJNfglqXgoQg0Rjj0YFs3NdmM,5,It is unbelievably great roasted lamb. Fried pepper and potato is also great. I thought this was a touristy place but when I went there in the last week of April they were all locals. This gives me reassurance.
ChIJNfglqXgoQg0Rjj0YFs3NdmM,5,"The oldest inn has been established since 1642. Great setting for our first meal in Madrid. We booked in advance and stated it for a birthday but they didn't do anything which is fine. We ordered the roast lamb and garlic prawns which were delicious. The lamb was so juicy didn't feel like eating lamb as the meat is so tender and didn't have that gaming smell. My husband loved the garlicky prawns. Overall, it was a good experience although the price is too steep. My husband certainly wasn't impressed with the price. It's too touristy but I really did enjoy the old inn building and vibe. We were given two keys printed with their inn name as souvenirs. Not sure if they give all people. After all still highly recommended it if money isn't a concern for you."
ChIJNfglqXgoQg0Rjj0YFs3NdmM,5,"The food was fantastic, nothing left over. The quality of the homemade pork meatball was outstanding and so was the rest! Furthermore, this place also has a story and an interesting history!"
ChIJNfglqXgoQg0Rjj0YFs3NdmM,5,"amazing place, perfect for family gatherings. the morcilla de burgos was amazing, the cogollos and tuna salad could use less cogollos. the charcuterie board amazing, fresh bread and good callos. my favorite was the oxtail, so tender and incredible sauce. the lamb was okay, a bit plane imo, but it was good. for desserts we tried the mixed plate and it was okay, nothing impressive. the bill for 8 people w wine and beers came to 450, quite expensive but worth the price for the city center."
ChIJYZsMIn8oQg0RfPVHFfWwSsE,4,"Restaurant by plaza mayor which is the most touristic place in Madrid so the prices are not great but not a tourist trap.

Huge seating area with many floors at the restaurant as you can see from the video.

We booked a group dinner and you have to pre-pay the booking with a high minimum order (watch-out)

The portions are at a decent size but I would not recommend the cheese platter as appetizer as they were not good. However, the remaining dishes were nice."
ChIJYZsMIn8oQg0RfPVHFfWwSsE,5,"One of the few places we found we could have the Cocido for a reasonable charge.
Lunchtime Cocido is amazing!
Enjoyed the delicious meal with the croquettes
Great service and delicious food"
ChIJYZsMIn8oQg0RfPVHFfWwSsE,5,"The restaurant, located near Plaza Mayor, offers a fantastic spot with a lively atmosphere. It‚Äôs a popular place, The food was enjoyable, although there was a slight hiccup when my husband‚Äôs order was unavailable‚Äîunfortunately, this was communicated 20 minutes later. Despite this, it‚Äôs worth visiting for the vibrant ambiance and the experience!"
ChIJYZsMIn8oQg0RfPVHFfWwSsE,5,"Don't miss it! If you come to Madrid you should come and eat here. A place full of history since 1894.
Amazing food, service and location. Just besides Plaza Mayor. Great team!.. if planning to come during weekend just reserve a table in advance."
ChIJYZsMIn8oQg0RfPVHFfWwSsE,4,"The restaurant is in a busy Plaza Mayor area. We were seated immediately even during busy hours. Downstairs is tapas and upstairs is restaurant just like other Madrid places. Also, I assume you need to close the menu for them to come and serve because it took them very long to do so.

-Crispy pork belly 4/5. Super crispy but salty.
-Cocido madrile√±o 5/5. The presentation was cute. -The soup was tasty and rich with flavor. The dry portion was filling with various meat cuts.
Meatballs with house special sauce 4/5. The house special sauce was like BBQ sauce and meatballs were good but not too extraordinary.
-tuna potato salad 5/5 was too the points with flavor. I love this dish. I wish there were more chips.

Overall it was a nice tourisy restaurant with paintings and decorations"
ChIJHeRevn4oQg0R1cMSLDTWlWg,5,"Chocolater√≠a San Gin√©s is a true Madrid classic, and I finally understand why! Even though the place was quite crowded when I arrived, the atmosphere was full of energy and charm, and the wait was absolutely worth it. As soon as the churros arrived, fresh and piping hot, I knew I was in for a treat. They were perfectly light and crisp, and when paired with their rich, velvety chocolate sauce, every bite was pure comfort and indulgence.

It‚Äôs the perfect spot for a traditional Madrid experience, whether you‚Äôre starting your day, taking a mid-day break, or ending a long evening. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the city ‚Äî delicious, authentic, and totally worth the wait!"
ChIJHeRevn4oQg0R1cMSLDTWlWg,5,One of the must visit places of Madrid and indeed well worth the visit. Unfortunately it is so popular that getting a seat here later in the day is next to impossible. The best time to enjoy the iconic chocolate con churros is early in the morning no late than at 8.00 am unless you want to spend long time waiting in the endless queue.
ChIJHeRevn4oQg0R1cMSLDTWlWg,4,"The most famous and old Churros place in Madrid.

It was very crowded as you can imagine but the service was really fast, so expect to wait 5-10 mins in queue.

The churros were very well cooked and chocolate if you area dark chocolate fan then you will love it.

Definitely worth trying!"
ChIJHeRevn4oQg0R1cMSLDTWlWg,5,"Had to try since it's on every food list on social media
Paid 8 euros for 12 churros and 1 melted chocolate
Also goy ice cream for 4euro each
Great dessert! Will it be the best i ever had? Probably not but worth the try"
ChIJHeRevn4oQg0R1cMSLDTWlWg,5,"Very very good because all is not so sweet. Delicious churros (‚Ç¨2.40) with intense chocolatey dipping sauce (‚Ç¨3.50). Yummy, not so sweet dark chocolate ice cream (‚Ç¨3.50).   Tried other churreria nearby (1902, Maestro), this one has the least sweet chocolate so far, Love it.  The staffs seem tired & not smiling already, probably understaffed, considering still so many customers at almost midnight."
ChIJV2X8RXkoQg0Rn4DLIk7dnHs,5,"When I say the staff is friendly, they are next level. The lady that served us was truely super nice! Also the food was delicious! All the smells of the dishes passing by were  amazing, we had a ‚Äòpati pami‚Äô plate to share with three. We added few extra tortillas and portions along with it. Super delicious! Mille Gracias!"
ChIJV2X8RXkoQg0Rn4DLIk7dnHs,3,As a Tejano (TexMex) had high hopes for this restaurant.  The taco pastor was ok but the tortilla was rubbery as if it was microwaved.  The cheese quesadilla was the smallest I‚Äôve personally observed.  Surprisingly my request to add chicken to the quesadilla was denied.  Are the quesadillas pre-made as the reason why?  We ordered tamales that never were delivered.  The two young men working provided the absolute minimum of service.  I really wished this had been a positive experience.  I did my best to be fair in my rating.  The location was clean and well appointed.
ChIJV2X8RXkoQg0Rn4DLIk7dnHs,4,Very friendly helpful staff. Food tasty with generous portions. Classic Margarita üçπ fantastic.
ChIJV2X8RXkoQg0Rn4DLIk7dnHs,5,Came here twice over the weekend as the first experience was so good. Food is beautifully prepared and tastes incredible. Atmosphere is great and staff are friendly. Highly recommend this place
ChIJV2X8RXkoQg0Rn4DLIk7dnHs,2,"the place isn‚Äôt horrible but the experience was a little disappointing. it‚Äôs definitely not autism friendly, there‚Äôs a lot of loud sounds and lights which isn‚Äôt a bad thing if you like that. the food was a bit of a miss, there was nothing wrong with it but it was also nothing spectacular. the service was just not good, our waiter was pretty rude and it seemed like we were bothering him all evening. basically it‚Äôs ok but there‚Äôs better options."
ChIJVak6hIAoQg0RDYHmzVgnW5I,5,"Great atmosphere,  Live latin music. Cocktails were over the bad side,  pricey .
I don't mind paying for something at least good, we tried the mojito's and the daikiri could not taste the rum.
Drink something else( maybe wine or beer)
The food was ok, ropa vieja, masas fritas and cuban tamales totally recommend , yuca frita meh!
I wouldnT take kids at least not at night, only because the music is loud and gets very crowded, busy but not in bad way . I went for dinner at 10pm with my kids (6-13) we had a good time, but me and my husband grow up having family dinners lile that
But as a mom rasing kids in US , I had my doubts
Make a RESERVATION ,"
ChIJVak6hIAoQg0RDYHmzVgnW5I,4,Latin live music joint. Fun for dancing but it‚Äôs a small place. They charge 15‚Ç¨ cover and you get a drink.
ChIJVak6hIAoQg0RDYHmzVgnW5I,4,Decent cuban place. Pork dish was tasty. Wished they put more shrimp on the other dish though. Great lively atmosphere.
ChIJVak6hIAoQg0RDYHmzVgnW5I,5,"Great spot for a taste of Cuba's music and atmosphere. For more than 20 years, it is the perfect sotp to listen good live cuban music. Sometimes it is crowded."
ChIJVak6hIAoQg0RDYHmzVgnW5I,4,"We tried to book this place for a couple of days, but it wasn't successful. So we went to this restaurant when it opened at 8 pm without a reservation. Luckily, there was a table, we had food and drinks!! Cuban live music was playing from 9pm. Also, all the dishes we ordered were great and they have delicious pina colada!!!! When we went out of the restaurant around 10.30 pm, there were a lot of people waiting outside to get inside!"
ChIJmQurr3goQg0RazVR0_FmOmY,5,"The title 'best steak in Madrid' is valid. Had the tuna and tomato salad with sourdough for starters, never tasted anything alike. Then just simply the pimientos and ribeye for main. Taste of the steak is to perfection and the peppers are exquisite.
Atmosphere is very relaxed and local. Upon check out you receive either a liquorice liquor or a baileys based liquor as a digestive. Rice pudding and cheese cake were fantastic too. Service was tiptop, very helpful staff members. Highly highly recommended!"
ChIJmQurr3goQg0RazVR0_FmOmY,4,"If you want a good aged steak cooked well and served in an elegant place - eat here! They served the steak with red peppers which went so well with the steak. I enjoyed their chorizo served as a starter. Their steaks are huge and is good for 2 people .

Want a good steak while in Madrid - eat here!"
ChIJmQurr3goQg0RazVR0_FmOmY,5,"Had the pleasure to have one of the best steak I‚Äôve ever had.
- Old cox T bone with domestic beef. Would the simple seasoning and perfect cooking. I finished it by myself but highly recommended for 2 people to share.
- roasted pepper is very tasty and sweet, good balance with the fresh bread
- fried chorizo is also good"
ChIJmQurr3goQg0RazVR0_FmOmY,4,"Food was average. Beef a bit tough with chewy sections.  Asparagus and pepper not my type. Service was average, could be better. Fish not too good either. I wouldn‚Äôt visit this place again."
ChIJmQurr3goQg0RazVR0_FmOmY,5,"Wonderful lunch.  Simple but perfectly executed foods.  So delish.  Very atmospheric.  Totally worth the drive.  Only dairy cattle - 7,8,9+ years grilled.  Really tasty."
ChIJPffUpHkoQg0RpEW9DNO3tZ8,5,"My boyfriend and I were treated with so much care in this place! We had razor clams, shark and paella. The food is affordable and super delicious!"
ChIJPffUpHkoQg0RpEW9DNO3tZ8,1,"For all the english speaking folks I highly unrecommend this place.
Food was quite expensive and very geasy.
The waiter was also very unfriendy.
Sorry but this was the last time...."
ChIJPffUpHkoQg0RpEW9DNO3tZ8,4,most of the staff do not speak English. the dishes are okay
ChIJPffUpHkoQg0RpEW9DNO3tZ8,1,"A SHAME of a restaurant. We came for a Christmas dinner and the food leaves a lot to be desired for a ‚Ç¨30 per person menu. Very slow in bringing out the dishes (eating the first ones at 12 at night when the reservation was at 10), even knowing what we wanted in advance since we had already specified it in the reservation.
On the other hand, this restaurant refuses to give the complaints book of the Community of Madrid, ILLEGAL THING, and on top of that they try to deceive us by giving us two copies of the green sheet so that we can take it to the consumer office (this is useless without the other two sheets, the white one and the pink one)."
ChIJPffUpHkoQg0RpEW9DNO3tZ8,5,"For me I give them 5 stars for quality, attention and location.
I made a reservation for dinner on New Year's Eve without seeing reviews, I assure you from the bottom of my heart that if I go to Madrid on New Year's Eve another year, I will definitely try to go to this restaurant for dinner.
Impossible to finish everything they give you, well yes, if you go on an empty stomach.
David, you are a great guy and it shows that you like your job, attentive, helpful and kind.
In general, I recommend this place and I'm sure that if you want to invite someone, you won't look bad."
ChIJ31PkD9UnQg0RDKNFqQcPIqw,4,Very cozy place and perfect local food - the style like tavernas but dishes looks and taste like in restaurants. Be careful with offering you a bread-one slice will cost you 3 eur (the waiter didin‚Äôt inform about it).
ChIJ31PkD9UnQg0RDKNFqQcPIqw,5,"Historical ancient restaurant in Madrid. Finally I found a place where to eat something traditional but not so well known, as the artichoke, or the cocido de Madrid, a stew with chickpeas, various meat cuts, and vegetables.

The wine choice is very good. They also have the Coravin system so you can taste expensive bottles without taking the whole bottle.

Strongly recommend the reservation, can be done via Google Maps, too."
ChIJ31PkD9UnQg0RDKNFqQcPIqw,5,"I loved the ambiance of this restaurant - and the food was very tasty.

Courteous and professional service, almost too quick!

The apple tart for dessert was amazing - the best I've had in years.

Warmly recommended."
ChIJ31PkD9UnQg0RDKNFqQcPIqw,5,"As a historical icon being the oldest tavern in Spain, I feel fortunate to have been able to grab a vermouth here while visiting Madrid. They were very welcoming and the vermut was tasty."
ChIJ31PkD9UnQg0RDKNFqQcPIqw,5,"Perfect experience!

Real people, oasis of peace, quietness, tradition and goodwill!

Come by and enjoy some cervezas!"
ChIJrav4tn4oQg0R_KMm2EwtGOU,4,Wanted to try the cuisine of Asturias! the steak on hot plate was fantastic and went well with the asturian cider. Cheesecake was creamy and not too sweet. Environment was a bit hectic and chaotic but warm overall
ChIJrav4tn4oQg0R_KMm2EwtGOU,5,"A piece of Asturia in the heart of Madrid. The place is quite hidden but it will surprise you with its warm furniture and hundreds of pictures about its history.  The food is eccellent, well prepared and perfectly cooked. The Fabada was incredible, as well as the salmon a la sidra and the Cachopo, just to mention the mains. The service was kind and friendly,  just a bit too slow, given that the place wasn't busy. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to try an excellent asturian restaurant! üòã"
ChIJrav4tn4oQg0R_KMm2EwtGOU,5,"El √ëeru is a hidden gem in Madrid. From the outside, it looks like a small, cozy spot, but once you go downstairs, you discover a large underground space filled with a vibrant atmosphere and walls lined with photos of famous visitors. The food is exceptional, and the traditional Asturian dishes truly stand out. My personal favorite was the pimientos rellenos de rabo de toro ‚Äì an amazing, flavorful dish that was perfectly prepared. The staff was friendly, attentive, and added to the authentic experience. It‚Äôs a must-visit for anyone looking to explore Spanish cuisine in a warm and welcoming setting!"
ChIJrav4tn4oQg0R_KMm2EwtGOU,4,"El Neru was recommended by a friend who lived in Madrid, overall it was a good experience. Fried Squid Croquets & Pulpo were good, although given the price tags I would have expected the portions to be more generous. Their Sangria: best one I tried in town. In terms of desert, their Cheesecake is not the usual international one and I would say it's a must-try. Service was very good: even if the waiter didn't speak English, the attention to the client and effort was admirable."
ChIJrav4tn4oQg0R_KMm2EwtGOU,1,"Food was so so the waiter was a bit too sticky while removing items from the table I felt uncomfortable being touched during the service at some point his arm fit was on top of my head while he was serving us

The dinner room is like a type of a cage very crowded and no air circulating I felt claustrophobic

The charged us 19‚Ç¨  for bread and 10‚Ç¨ for each little stuffed pepper

I left hungry the restaurant paying 40‚Ç¨ per person.

The overall experience is disappointing‚Ä¶"
ChIJD9GKIn8oQg0RdhelKaP9Ac4,4,"If you find yourself near Mayer Plaza and crave an unforgettable squid calamari experience, this is the place to be! Renowned for its incredibly flavorful and perfectly crispy squid, this spot draws a bustling crowd, and for good reason. Be prepared to wait in line if you wish to dine inside, or opt for a convenient grab-and-go option. Either way, the wait is well worth it. Generously portioned, a single serving is more than satisfying for one person. A must-try for seafood lovers!"
ChIJD9GKIn8oQg0RdhelKaP9Ac4,3,"Just the hype of social media. Calamari are good but the rest is just average, you can find similar in less crowded places. I had the pancetta and was chewy. If you enjoy food without gravy or sauce then this is your place, you might find it dry otherwise. I wouldn‚Äôt queue again, just buy takeaway calamari. And the smell to cleaner is very potent than even overpowered the food."
ChIJD9GKIn8oQg0RdhelKaP9Ac4,4,"The truth is I‚Äôm not too sure even now what the hype is about! The queue is crazy long. 1st time I went, it was around 1-2pm and it was a long queue and I was hungry so I decided not to wait. 2nd day I went again, this time around 3+pm ‚Ä¶ the queue is still long. Since it‚Äôs a highly recommended place for the calamari sandwich, I decided I‚Äôll queue and try. It is nice, as in the sandwich is unique and I‚Äôve not had a calamari sandwich before. It is of course dry, since it‚Äôs deep fried. There are other options for sandwiches, so if you don‚Äôt like deep fried, there are other choices. Reasonable price , it‚Äôs filling and cheap. The olives however to me is just so so. Anyways, if you like calamari, and you want to try , I would recommend."
ChIJD9GKIn8oQg0RdhelKaP9Ac4,5,"The best fried calamari sandwich I‚Äôve ever tasted! Located in the center of Madrid, this place is worth the visit. There was a waiting line, but it moved quickly. The prices are affordable, and the food is delicious. I highly recommend it!"
ChIJD9GKIn8oQg0RdhelKaP9Ac4,4,"I understand the hype to try ""the best bocata de calamares in Madrid"", but I am not so sure whether the hype is so justified. I mean, it's fried squid inside bread, of course it will be good. I don't know how the competition is, maybe this one IS as good as they say, but well I believe any bocata would work.

In any case, the sandwich was really good, I enjoyed it a lot. It has a lot of squid, and the price is quite cheap (4.50 EUR) considering that with one it is more than enough to have a meal. The queue to eat inside is insane, but if you do takeaway the speed is crazy. We did a queue that seemed infinite but we had our order done in 8 minutes."
ChIJvYe_03goQg0RzOiyJuuE5ac,5,"This place is a gem! The history, architecture, food and service in one place of the old Madrid. √Ålvaro, our server, was very attentive, provided great suggestions, and super friendly. Highly recommended!"
ChIJvYe_03goQg0RzOiyJuuE5ac,5,We had an amazing experience.  This is an old building from 1860.  I came here 40 years ago in my 20s and the mushrooms with garlic were the best.  They still are with many more additional menu items.   Alvaro our server gave us exceptional service.   I highly recommend this to anyone.
ChIJvYe_03goQg0RzOiyJuuE5ac,4,"e tried out a local restaurant near the Plaza Mayor. The staff is hospitable and the restaurant exudes a nice traditional vibe. We happened to catch a band performance during mealtime, the atmosphere was upbeat.

The suckling pig was good, but overall the food was saltier than we liked."
ChIJvYe_03goQg0RzOiyJuuE5ac,3,"The ambiance was highly enjoyable, however, the quality of the food was merely satisfactory. I believe the crowded conditions due to the weekend and the Real Madrid vs. Barcelona match may have contributed to this. I intend to revisit the establishment during a less crowded time to provide a more accurate assessment."
ChIJvYe_03goQg0RzOiyJuuE5ac,5,"We had just finished a bike tour. We‚Äôre walking around the street looking for a place to dine. A couple overheard us discussing what the three of us wanted and they said try this place we found it last year doing the same thing you‚Äôre doing right now, debating where to go.  Walk inside and it‚Äôs like a labyrinth to get to the very back table. I just saw from a previous review that you could get a tour totally bummed. I didn‚Äôt see that before we left. Food was delicious, atmosphere  was tremendous and the service was spectacular."
ChIJZxcuv34oQg0RnOVK2H4yFIc,5,"October 2024: We came back to try the weekday lunch menu (you have to ask for it!): It had gone up from 16‚Ç¨ before the summer to 18‚Ç¨ but was still good value. Really enjoyed the provolone al forno, the tagliatelli rag√∫ and the tiramisu to finish off with.

June 2024: We went √† la carte as we didn't realise there was a set weekday lunch menu and no one told us. The waiter was not happy in his work or was just having an off day!

We spent a lot more than we normally would on a weekday lunch but the food was good: tagliatelli della casa and a summer risotto stivo. We shared an insalata caprese and a hazelnut icecream dessert from nextdoor Chocolater√≠a San Gin√©s.

PD A group of 11 from our Italian class at the nearby Istituto di Cultura came a week later and had the set lunch on the terrace which was not only excellent but also better value."
ChIJZxcuv34oQg0RnOVK2H4yFIc,5,"Amazing restaurant!! I went there to celebrate my 1st anniversary with my boyfriend. The place is cozy, though full of people at times, I highly recommend to make a reservation if you want to come here, as you will have to wait around 40 minutes for a table.

There good was amazing! Both my boyfriend and I loved it and every penny we spent there was worth it! The waiter was very polite and professional; he explained the menu to us with great detail and helped us to choose what to order.

I will surely come back here for every special date with my family, friends and partner."
ChIJZxcuv34oQg0RnOVK2H4yFIc,5,"Cozy place, regardless of the tourist place. Price ok, just fried dough and hot chocolate, but this return to childhood."
ChIJZxcuv34oQg0RnOVK2H4yFIc,4,"Overall, a great little Italian spot. Service was relatively quick and the food was good. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd rush back to them but they were definitely good."
ChIJZxcuv34oQg0RnOVK2H4yFIc,3,"I know it‚Äôs weird to have Italian while in Spain but we were hungry and the reviews looked good. My wife had the Tagliatelle Bolognesa which was super salty and I had a gnocchi with mushrooms in a cream sauce which was good just heavy. The caprese salad was good.

Our real complaint comes from the waiter who was either really dumb or hates tourists. My wife is fluent in Spanish and I know enough to get by especially how to order drinks. I asked for a glass of red wine and a bottle of water for my wife. The waiter brought a bottle of water with two glasses. After a few minutes of him standing around I asked for my glass of wine. He played dumb (or is) and poured me a glass maybe 20 percent full. The bottle had maybe a swallow left in it and he stopped pouring and walked away. My wife had a picture of what she wanted and specifically asked him what it was, he literally told her yet ordered something else."
ChIJiTGJRSomQg0RTD1MZa1RTnE,3,This tapas bar is very popular and often has queues for table. We came ~6:30pm on a Saturday night and waited about 15min. And it was worthy of a wait. The highlight was the grilled octopus- Smokey tender with a good chew. Excellent execution. The seafood paella was nice but less successful IMHO .. the meats were overcooked though the rice had good flavor. The Mediterranean salad was refreshingly good. I wished the orange slices had the skin removed as it was rather unpleasant to bite into these. Nonetheless we had a pleasant evening. And thanks for the complimentary limoncello.
ChIJiTGJRSomQg0RTD1MZa1RTnE,5,"Had a wonderful experience at Taberna El Sur. Our waiter was incredibly attentive, making sure we had everything we needed and the service was quick. It seems like a small place, but theres a good amount of seating inside. To avoid having to wait for a seat, I would recommend arriving a bit before 7pm. We ordered the garlic prawns, they were perfectly cooked and had a rich, garlicky flavor. Be sure to ask for some bread to soak up some of that sauce. The pork cheeks were tender and paired wonderfully with the creamy smashed potatoes. The grilled octopus was one of the highlights, it was cooked with just the right amount of char and tender without being too chewy. The Iberian ham platter was also great, though a bit on the salty side for my taste, but still enjoyable. I do wish they had provided more breadsticks to balance out the saltiness. Finally, the sangria was a perfect companion to our meal. It was refreshing, fruity, and not too sweet. Would definitely come back if I‚Äôm in Madrid again!"
ChIJiTGJRSomQg0RTD1MZa1RTnE,5,"Been here twice on my Madrid trip....the service and atmosphere is exceptional as the staff is super friendly and easy going which makes it an ideal place for a solo traveller. They have a one person serving of seafood paella which is so tasty and the other items on the menu are good portions too. Special shout out to Ari, Franco and Oswaldo whom made me feel so relaxed and well served."
ChIJiTGJRSomQg0RTD1MZa1RTnE,5,"This restaurant located on a smalll street, it truly feels like a hidden gem, and the experience here indeed lived up to that impression.
It was pretty busy, so we had to wait a bit outside, but it was definitely worth it. The staff here was cheerful and made us feel welcome. We had some classic Spanish dishes: seafood paella, cuban beef, and baby squid salad. The food was really flavorful, so we were really happy with our meal. Plus, they gave us a couple of free shots to say sorry for the wait, which was a nice surprise. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. I surely will come back as well"
ChIJiTGJRSomQg0RTD1MZa1RTnE,5,"We visited this restaurant on our first night in Madrid.  Reasonably priced tapas and the sangria was delicious.  There wasn't an empty table the whole time we were there.  We enjoyed it so much we went again for the final dinner of our trip.  Because this place is so busy, it can be difficult to get the attention of your server."
ChIJN2LTXtUnQg0R-Mdi2grugVA,4,"I've never been to a show here, just to the terrace on the last floor. Expensive, really expensive, but they have a rooftop with some great views. The waiters are friendly and attentive so at least there's that."
ChIJN2LTXtUnQg0R-Mdi2grugVA,4,"They have a nice terrace with a couple of tables with views to southern Madrid. Food is not bad considering the price.

Also good place to have a drink in Tirso de Molina"
ChIJN2LTXtUnQg0R-Mdi2grugVA,4,Great views of the south of Madrid. Balcony has a roof so is nice and cool - not in direct sunlight; perfect for a starter before walking into town for food
ChIJN2LTXtUnQg0R-Mdi2grugVA,5,"The view, the service, the attention, the professionals working here, everything is simply perfect. Food is delicious as well!
Definitely a place to spend the afternoon!"
ChIJN2LTXtUnQg0R-Mdi2grugVA,4,"Came for lunch. Great racion, coffee. Nice views from the 6th floor."
ChIJFYRHQH4oQg0RanKiSJecoTo,5,"I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude for the truly wonderful experience I had at your restaurant. The service was impeccable, with your staff being attentive and professional, making me feel valued as a guest. The promptness of the service was impressive, ensuring a seamless dining experience.

The food was absolutely incredible! Each dish was not only delicious but also beautifully presented, and the generous portions were a delightful surprise. Thank you for your hospitality and creating such a welcoming atmosphere. I will certainly recommend your restaurant and look forward to my next visit!
The Greeks!"
ChIJFYRHQH4oQg0RanKiSJecoTo,3,"The steak was nice, not medium as I ordered it though. Very red, a bit chewy, but it was a great steak and the sauce accompanying it was nice. The bolognese was mediocre at best, it‚Äôs something I could make at home with my eyes closed and had no wow factor to it at all. They bring you bread to start the meal, alongside a soup cup type situation ; this actually was the best part of the whole meal. BUT, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs free, they bring it you as a nice gesture then charge you for it. Hahah. Water is $4. Not worth the meal in all honesty, it was a great vibe inside though which made it a nice date with my wife on a Madrid night. Whole meal came out to about 75 euros."
ChIJFYRHQH4oQg0RanKiSJecoTo,5,The food tasted very good. We will definitely go again.
ChIJFYRHQH4oQg0RanKiSJecoTo,5,"I recently had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. From the warm welcome to the impeccable service, every detail was perfect. Highlights included a refreshing champagne soup and a complimentary delicious dessert. The main courses were cooked to perfection, and the overall ambiance was inviting. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone seeking a memorable and delicious meal."
ChIJFYRHQH4oQg0RanKiSJecoTo,5,"Wow, the service was 10! The staff are super friendly and courteous, the food was perfection! Delicious meats including Ribeye steak and Sirloin. The salads and appetizers were very good! Loved the meat empanadas and tuna tartar. Highly recommended!"
ChIJDWmWQ4AoQg0RuQmiidT9lrI,5,"It was a great experience from start till finish. Host and waiters were very courteous. We had a tomato, lettuce, avocado, black olives with tuna salad. For an entree, we had wild grilled seabass. For drinks, we had JW red label shot and great tequila cocktail (not dilluted with nice flavor of grapefruit). Dessert was a chocolate Ecuador cake with vanilla ice cream."
ChIJDWmWQ4AoQg0RuQmiidT9lrI,4,"Really nice restaurant with splendid looks over Madrid skies, set in Plaza Santa Ana. Most people come here to have a drink with nice views over the rooftops. So the food is slightly overpriced and not so abundant, but delicious.
The waiter explained each dish with great care and served the white wine we ordered exquisitely.
It took a bit long for the bill to arrive but they were nice and friendly.
One negative point is they don‚Äôt serve coffees."
ChIJDWmWQ4AoQg0RuQmiidT9lrI,3,Great view over the city however totally packed and short of staff. The toilets were dirty and had no hand dryer or paper towels to dry your hands. Good enough wine selection that comes with some nibbles.
ChIJDWmWQ4AoQg0RuQmiidT9lrI,5,"Nice location in the heart of Madrid on the roof of ME Madrid. Service was excellent and the in-house DJ played a great mix of house music that kept the crowd lively. Drinks were reasonably priced and we'll made. Attentive service, good vibe and crowd make this a superb location for a night out in the city."
ChIJDWmWQ4AoQg0RuQmiidT9lrI,5,"We were on Thursday, less people and all the service was amazing and attentive, cocktails are bombastic, great views from the terrace"
ChIJZ6yb2H8oQg0RzdKpCrMGPUo,5,"Very good food and drinks in central Madrid, the atmosphere is very authentic. The ham and the cheese were amazing.
I would recommend to stop here for an aperitivo rather than a proper dinner.
The place is actually really small. Prices are honest"
ChIJZ6yb2H8oQg0RzdKpCrMGPUo,5,"Just had my lunch at Matador, the area is beautiful, the vibes more. I had a toast and tortilla and the portions are generous. Value for Money Is excellent and I enjoyed my staying thanks to Ivan, Liana and Isti. I would recommend you not to miss it!"
ChIJZ6yb2H8oQg0RzdKpCrMGPUo,4,"The ambiance is quite pleasant but it is a very small place. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is no English on the menus, I recommend you to research in advance. The food was also delicious but I can't say we liked it very much. Thank you"
ChIJZ6yb2H8oQg0RzdKpCrMGPUo,5,Superb Tapas bar the meatballs were simply awesome with great flavor and a wonderful sauce! One of the best Tapa we had in our 5 day Madrid stay!
ChIJZ6yb2H8oQg0RzdKpCrMGPUo,5,"It's a 'must-go' place.

Delicious food, nice service and an authentic ambience. It's a very small place. But you will see how a Spanish tavern is like.

You gotta try goat cheese."
ChIJQUgqa4AoQg0R30E7m4lPeoE,5,"Amazing Jazz, fantastic food (go for the special menu, it's great value for money) and the staff were brilliant, all professional and looked after us completely. I can't recommend Cafe Central enough. A must when visiting Madrid!"
ChIJQUgqa4AoQg0R30E7m4lPeoE,4,"Lovely place to see live jazz! We bought bar tickets but were upgraded to a table. The service was great, friendly, and attentive, but not overbearing. The staff seemed like they were having as much fun as we were. Most seats in the venue have a good view of the band"
ChIJQUgqa4AoQg0R30E7m4lPeoE,4,"Good food, good service, great atmosphere. Buba was playing is first set of the night.  With that, service expectedly took a seat to allow the performance to thrive.  But, once the set was done, they have you 15min to get out to get the place ready for the next set.  That was disappointing."
ChIJQUgqa4AoQg0R30E7m4lPeoE,5,We entered this place for a nightcap only to remain for 2 hours due to the sensational voice of this lady and the amazing tunes from the jazz band. Incredible and memorable experience and I hope I get to watch them again in the future
ChIJQUgqa4AoQg0R30E7m4lPeoE,5,Went there for a live jazz performance. Awesome evening. The show performed by Jose Luis Gutierrez trio was magical!
ChIJ9x8MfCsmQg0RvVW0y5Wg1tI,5,My husband loves this roasted young lamb dish in this restaurant so much. Recommend order a Cuarto (1/4) size for more tender meat. We come here every time when we are on Madrid.
ChIJ9x8MfCsmQg0RvVW0y5Wg1tI,4,"Canteen style place. A bit relaxed approach.

Food was great, wine was cheap with a quite alright selection.

Had some jamon, some carne fritas, and croquettes. All super tasty.

Service was inattentive, but it really did not matter as the whole canteen style foreshadows that.

Recommended for an uncomplicated quick meal, and a look into the more everyday consumer from Madrid."
ChIJ9x8MfCsmQg0RvVW0y5Wg1tI,4,"Had a protein feast for dinner~
Everything was good,
Octopus Galician style was the best I had ever, fresh and just the right texture. The corpse sea salt add a good flavor just wished it was not that corpse but finer.
Grilled cuttlefish was also very fresh, no complaints. oven baked sea bass was a bit overcooked but, fresh, so it made it up.

Was very loud in there due to a table of 5 that were laughing so loud, overall on the loud side due to how packed it was.

Wine at average 3‚Ç¨/glass, great deal for me ~

I understand the reviews from a few about the ‚Äúuncleanness‚Äù, at the very end, we had an ‚Äúinvited creature‚Äù to our table, I ended its visit very quickly.  Or else would‚Äôve given a 5 stars."
ChIJ9x8MfCsmQg0RvVW0y5Wg1tI,5,"Really like the service. The lady who served us puts on a big smile, is very nice to give recommendation on food. Very patient when taking our orders. Seafood/fish is very fresh. Soup is a little salty but yummy. I had the set meal and think it‚Äôs very worthy!"
ChIJ9x8MfCsmQg0RvVW0y5Wg1tI,4,"I visited this place to have some traditional Spain food. The food was good overall, however the beef was so raw. It was not match the taste of Asian culture. They said Spanish liked that way. But you still can ask them to cook well done steak for you."
ChIJTcCqK3koQg0Ry57BfkqF_xI,2,"Stopped in for dinner of Tapas while at the Plaza.
The atmosphere was good with comfortable vibes. However the food was not worth the visit. The prize winning croquettes was literally the worst I have had this entire trip. They were tiny stodgy balls with absolutely no Jamin in them. They should be ashamed to call them croquettes.
The chorizo in cider was fair but the Jamon tasting selection was underwhelming. It was dry and tasteless.
The black pudding lacked any character and the peppers were overdone.
This is one of those tourist trap restaurants that everyone warns you about.
I would give it a miss"
ChIJTcCqK3koQg0Ry57BfkqF_xI,5,"Decided to walk to this restaurant  for lunch since our room was not ready at the RIU Plaza Espana.

A great place to sample Jamon Serrano Ham as well as other items such as Croquettes,sandwiches and local beer.

There are counters in front for informal dining  as well as tables to enjoy a sit down meal. Many locals  came in to purchase ham to go.

Ham is fantastic and there are rows of hams dangling from the ceiling or lining the walls. A great photo opportunity..lol!

For a good sample of Spanish/Madrid fare,give them a try."
ChIJTcCqK3koQg0Ry57BfkqF_xI,3,"In a city that loves its Museums, here we have one to ""ham.""

I restaurant chain in the city with several locations, we stopped at the one in the Plaza Mayor for a ham board.  It was very nice, but a bit pricey for the amount served.  We had better at other places, which for a place that is the Museum of Ham, was a bit surprising.

They feature an off-sale butcher counter and are doing a brisk business, the place is lined with hams."
ChIJTcCqK3koQg0Ry57BfkqF_xI,2,"We came here after abandoning the place next door. Initially the waiter was very welcoming,but he seemed to take offence at the fact that we didn't want to order steak and so rather than taking our order went off to talk to other tables, move around forks etc. The other waiters didn't seem able to serve us so we had to wait for the head waiter for 10 minutes (we would have left but for the fact that the prior restaurant was worse). Once we had ordered the food came quickly and was acceptable. Service is gruff and not friendly at all."
ChIJTcCqK3koQg0Ry57BfkqF_xI,3,"Ate here as it was the nearest and we were really hungry and couldn‚Äôt be bothered to look for another place.

We ordered jamon serrano, mixed paella, and calamari. We only liked the jamon, but even that was just average. The paella lacked flavor and I think they just reheated it because it came out pretty quick. The calamari was dry and bland. Generous serving for all though.

We came during lunch time, so understandably the staff was busy, but they felt standoffish when they finally got to us."
ChIJ88NrIX8oQg0RzJ9prFKYkC4,1,"If I could give 0 stars I would.
Terrible food, you can clearly see on the picture, rice uncooked, and there was only a tiny piece of octopus and only two rings of calamari. I am a seafood lover and I know what a decent taste is. This one tastes like they been cooked again and again and probably left overs from other people. Terrible service as well."
ChIJ88NrIX8oQg0RzJ9prFKYkC4,1,Food was awful. We asked for octopus and it was so difficult to chew. The worst I had in Madrid. We also asked for a pasta a la bolo√±esa horritble. The waiter was cleaning some tables and the rag smelled horrible. If you want to go only for drinks maybe it‚Äôs ok.
ChIJ88NrIX8oQg0RzJ9prFKYkC4,2,"Expensive. Asked for coffee and tea at 2.30pm and they did not have any??? It was raining and they sat us in a corner right under the pouring water. We ordered three Cokes and they were warm, one without gas. The bathrooms (both men's and women's) were dirty. Someone had clogged one of the toilets in the men's bathroom and there was water everywhere."
ChIJ88NrIX8oQg0RzJ9prFKYkC4,4,Most tourists have a beer here.  Crowded of people.  Just an experience!
ChIJ88NrIX8oQg0RzJ9prFKYkC4,5,"Madrid‚Äôs Plaza Mayor is a symbol of the city and a must-see. This enormous esplanade in the city centre was begun in the 17th century by King Philip III, whose bronze equestrian statue stands in the square. Officially opened in 1620, it is rectangular in shape and lined with pillars and arches.

Over the years it has been the setting for many public events, from bullfights, processions, fiestas and theatrical productions to trials of the Inquisition and even executions. The arcades are home to many traditional shops and a plethora of bars and restaurants. Some of the most notable buildings on the square are the Casa de la Panader√≠a, with a frescoed fa√ßade, and the Casa de la Carnicer√≠a."
ChIJnfWXvngoQg0R2x1agMcUzZI,5,"We were to try the traditional Medro√±o and we absolutely love it!! ü•∞ this traditional drink is served super cold within a chocolate cup (yes, you read right, cookie-chocolate cup that you can eat after). We did not try food, just several shots of Medro√±o.
The service is very friendly, highly recommended! ü•ÇCheers"
ChIJnfWXvngoQg0R2x1agMcUzZI,5,"We stopped in on a walking tour and had some Madro√±o shots. They were unique. Liquor was sweet, much like cognac. And the edible shot glass was super fun"
ChIJnfWXvngoQg0R2x1agMcUzZI,4,I got my first taste of Spanish food and sangria here. A nice cozy affordable place with good service. A place to have a great breakfast and a quiet by the roadside drink in the evening.
ChIJnfWXvngoQg0R2x1agMcUzZI,5,I love this place. We went there a few times when we were in Madrid. The best Sangria and the food is excellent. We were served by Christian who was very kind and hospitable. Highly recommend and we will definitely come back.
ChIJnfWXvngoQg0R2x1agMcUzZI,5,The food was really amazing and very authentic Spanish food. Es muy originales. We had arroz caldoso and iberican pork chops with potato and salsa. We also tried pan and alioli sauce. The alioli sauce felt like homemade üòã All in all a good recommendation if you want to have some authentic Spanish food close to the centre of Madrid.
ChIJhTceECsmQg0R6_SF_c2Mo8Q,5,"Food is amazing. We ordered Zapatilla, Pimentos Padron , Croquetones and 2 beer for 2 of us. The only thing is that we didn‚Äôt realised the portion was huge ! Which is value for money. Love the homely atmosphere too. Highly recommend."
ChIJhTceECsmQg0R6_SF_c2Mo8Q,5,"I went there recommended. It was an amazing experience. We enjoyed the ""zapatilla"" which is a huge sandwich with melted cheese to share. The croquetad were really good too.
You won't probably have a table as the place is very small.
I'll definitely come back."
ChIJhTceECsmQg0R6_SF_c2Mo8Q,4,small place but they have some tables inside; very good price/quality
ChIJhTceECsmQg0R6_SF_c2Mo8Q,5,"Food was great.  Be mindful of the portion size you're ordering, they're big."
ChIJhTceECsmQg0R6_SF_c2Mo8Q,5,"I went to this restaurant a couple of years ago to try their famous pork shoulder sandwiches and croquettes. To be honest, they were simply delicious.

They serve big portions, so I‚Äôll advise people to start with half sandwich only. If you fancy more, no problem, they have fast service."
ChIJZ8eJ5H4oQg0RPW4eQzG0UjY,5,"I've been here twice during my stay in Madrid and I'm sad I didn't come here earlier. The cr√™pes are out of this world and very tasty! I especially enjoyed the Nutella strawberry cr√™pe. Also, the people working there are very friendly even during high frequency. I will definitely come back here during my next visit to Madrid."
ChIJZ8eJ5H4oQg0RPW4eQzG0UjY,5,"Amazingly good pancakes, maybe a bit expensive even for the basic ones. But it's very nice that they bring you a glass of water from the house. In conclusion, we would definitely come back if we come to Madrid again"
ChIJZ8eJ5H4oQg0RPW4eQzG0UjY,5,"A fantastic breakfast/brunch spot in

A perfect spot for breakfast in the heart of Madrid! The service is kind, making you feel right at home. They offer a great selection of healthy options, and the portions are generous‚Äîdefinitely worth the price. It‚Äôs a popular spot, so be prepared for it to be quite busy, but it‚Äôs absolutely worth the wait. A must-visit for a satisfying and wholesome start to your day!"
ChIJZ8eJ5H4oQg0RPW4eQzG0UjY,5,"Very good food in a very good setting with friendly courteous staff. Crepe with roast pear, almonds and ice cream so good we went back the next day. We ate outdoors under heated canopy which was very relaxing."
ChIJZ8eJ5H4oQg0RPW4eQzG0UjY,4,"We went there on the wrong Sunday where it was very full. But, the staff was very friendly and we(Chewie and I) didn‚Äôt wait for too long to get a seat. I ordered a pollo crepe and plain water.
I‚Äôm not sure about the sweet crepe. The pollo crepe was alright but didn‚Äôt wow me. Possibly because I‚Äôve tasted a more crunchy crepe before so this one was not as ideal. Nevertheless, that didn‚Äôt discredit them from their signature sweet crepes. I‚Äôve never tasted them and possibly will be on my next visit."
ChIJ1wgKCtYnQg0REyK5h08UNQw,5,"Today, a friend of mine who is from Madrid took me to this place and it did not disappoint. It is a place filled with tradition and the candy that people from Madrid used to have when theynwere kids. It is a very traditional place that you will be amazed to visit discovering sweets that you could have never dream of. It is like visiting the Wonka factory!! Worth taking a look!"
ChIJ1wgKCtYnQg0REyK5h08UNQw,5,Classic Best Candy Store in Madrid you absolutely need to stop buy its an experience more than a store they are nice and sell tradition classic candy
ChIJ1wgKCtYnQg0REyK5h08UNQw,5,Stunning candy shop
ChIJ1wgKCtYnQg0REyK5h08UNQw,5,This place is incredible. The displays are excellent and the selection of different sweets is phenomenal. If you have a sweet tooth this place is for you.
ChIJ1wgKCtYnQg0REyK5h08UNQw,5,"One of the most charming and yet dangerous stores in Madrid city centre. If you behave well they might even treat you. I've been several times, one of them with my nephew, and he couldn't believe that such a place existed. It's what dreams are made of!!! Excellent service, they are always very natural and nice."
ChIJsTGbt3goQg0Ro22kRtSOCKU,2,"Came here 20 years ago, possibly the best steak have ever had. Was so looking forward to returning. To be fair the steak was still good however the place has deteriorated very badly. It was dirty, cold, very quiet, the owner, apparently the Grandson of the founder, disinterested, unwelcoming and dressed in filthy clothes. All in all a sad example of a once great institution now just a shadow of its former self. Such a shame."
ChIJsTGbt3goQg0Ro22kRtSOCKU,1,Paying 72 euros to be yelled at by a Spanish man for ordering tapas at lunch is not exactly what I planned for my trip to Madrid. Try handing us a different menu when we sit down then mate.
ChIJsTGbt3goQg0Ro22kRtSOCKU,3,"The restaurant is shadow of its former self.

A dozen years ago it was vibrant and full of life. They made a deserved big deal of their beef solomillo, which was available in different sizes, and then served rare on a special super-heated thick ceramic plate with their logo and ‚ÄúCuidado ¬°Plato Caliente!‚Äù where you would finish cooking your meat to perfection. The place was always buzzing with waiters eager to serve.

But not anymore. ‚ÄúThis‚Äù isn‚Äôt available, ‚Äúthat‚Äú isn‚Äôt available, we don‚Äôt do ‚Äúthat‚Äú anymore, ‚Äúthat‚Äù is only available in the morning. And the waiter, while not rude, was no fountain of conversation and projected boredom at every opportunity. And btw, this was not some cultural disconnect between tourist and native; I‚Äôm Spanish.

I‚Äôll content myself with the fond memories of the past and never return."
ChIJsTGbt3goQg0Ro22kRtSOCKU,5,"How can there be no ratings?  This is a very old and wonderful restaurant.  My wife came her as a child 52 years ago.  Steaks, chops, and other meat, veggies and traditional Spanish fare simply but brilliantly done.  Highly recommended."
ChIJsTGbt3goQg0Ro22kRtSOCKU,2,Expensive. Just one menu option not worth the price. We ordered 2 main course and the main dish in the menu was broken eggs(fried eggs with French fries) and ratatouille(hardly any vegetables tasted mainly sweet onions). Pic attached.
ChIJpz2YjCsmQg0RnCHoa4VSSZQ,4,"It‚Äôs actually a great place, we went only for a little breakfast and as we saw on the menu it has great options."
ChIJpz2YjCsmQg0RnCHoa4VSSZQ,5,"Amazing service, great atmosphere, delicious selection of beers and most of all, delicious Cuban food."
ChIJpz2YjCsmQg0RnCHoa4VSSZQ,5,"Cool spot for breakfast and 100 beers. Waitresses are super nice, so the experience is just pleasant overall."
ChIJpz2YjCsmQg0RnCHoa4VSSZQ,5,"We took a typical breakfast ""pan con tomaca (2 toasted breds with olive oil and tomatoes), it was served with a coffee and a fresh orange juice. It costs 3,5‚Ç¨. It was very nice! This breakfast is only served during the week-end."
ChIJpz2YjCsmQg0RnCHoa4VSSZQ,5,"Our go-to place when we are in Madrid. We absolutely love this restaurant. The indoor and outdoor seating options are just great. We have always easily found a seat right away. Food choices are quite varied, but you must try the patacones con cochinita pibil when you go! My absolute favorite I ordered 4 times during our recent stay. Our servers were gracious and made delicious suggestions to try. Good people, good food, good drinks good choice!"
ChIJFTdO-X4oQg0RRNg80K2yJqY,3,"Restaurante San Crist√≥bal near to the plaza principal is simple not sofisticated but cheaper than the others in the region.
The menu has salads, meet, fishes and sandwiches.
We went without e,pectations, we ordered fish and seafood paella.
The fish was delicious the paella was well served, taste was good enough.
The drink was very good.
The service is very good, waiter attentive and cordial."
ChIJFTdO-X4oQg0RRNg80K2yJqY,1,"I ordered the fried chicken dish on the 12th April and it was hairy, dry, greasy, flavourless, tasted of fried oil and fish like it had been cooked in the same fryer as the fish. Which could be dangerous to those who have allergies. I couldn‚Äôt eat it at all. The rest of the food was mediocre and the staff was very rude. They complained to other colleagues about us not leaving a tip. Don‚Äôt go to restaurants where staff invite you off the street - a bad omen."
ChIJFTdO-X4oQg0RRNg80K2yJqY,4,"Nice service. Nice food. Nothing extraordinary, but it suits the prices."
ChIJFTdO-X4oQg0RRNg80K2yJqY,5,Excellent service. Fast and courteous!!  Bravo!!
ChIJFTdO-X4oQg0RRNg80K2yJqY,1,"It completely was a joke!!! I can't recommend this place to nobody. I supposed anywhere else is better than San Crist√≥bal. We had to wait more than half an hour to get part of the food, I say part because the waiter forgot about the rest of the order.. Well, we reorder the two missed dishes and after another 15 min he just brought one!!! Definitely a big joke.. Still can't believe this.."
ChIJjZmkun4oQg0RJ6HnwMmqlSI,5,"We just finished viewing the Easter Sunday drum performance so looked for lunch. This place was close to the Plaza Mayor and had good reviews. We popped in and went downstairs as it seemed more informal. We ended up at a high table with tall chairs so not the most comfortable but it was the last available when we arrived.

The menu looked good and we ended up over ordering, so skipped pretty much all the carbs. Started with white wine and they brought a plate of garlic mayo potatoes which we polished off before the main courses arrived.

First dish was a Mediterranean salad with smoked salmon. Surprisingly the salmon was wrapped around cold sweet melon.  See the pictures. Tasted good and was a refreshing start to the meal.

Then came our grilled squid. That was so good! Squeeze of lemon and it was perfect! We regretted not getting any bread to sop up oil and juices!

Then we had a plate of razor clams. We saw the table behind us having it and the waiter noticed and told us that they were out. Only to have another waiter coming by a couple of minutes later to say they had one last order available and do we want it? Immediate yes! And when it came, it was also delicious!

Last dish was the bacalao. The cod was perfect cooked and the sauce was drinkable on it's own. We were quite full by then so left most off the potatoes, etc.

I had an espresso to end and they brought a couple of digestifs as well. Overall, it was a great meal and my wife and I left planning on when to return for a 2nd round!"
ChIJjZmkun4oQg0RJ6HnwMmqlSI,5,"Chanced upon this well rated Galician restaurant near Plaza Major. And it was one of our best meals in Madrid! The staffs were attentive and paced our dishes well so we could enjoy each course with no rush. We started with the marinated salmon salad which had the cured salmon wrapped around melon. Refreshing, and delightfully different. The grilled baby squid were excellent- tenderly chewy and tasty. Then we had the bamboo /razor clam which was outstandingly good. Lastly we had the bacalau, the cod fillet dish braised with potato slices in olive oil. It was so good üòä"
ChIJjZmkun4oQg0RJ6HnwMmqlSI,5,"My boyfriend and I went here to have dinner and we came out satisfied and wanting to go back again soon. Since it‚Äôs a restaurant that specializes in Galician cooking, the prices are reasonable and the food quality? Just splendid. üëåüèº We really enjoyed the food and the ambience of the place and even recommended it to our friends if they want to experience such decadent cuisine. ü§©ü§©"
ChIJjZmkun4oQg0RJ6HnwMmqlSI,5,"Old traditional Galician restaurant, excellent location, very elegant. We loved the grilled octopus and the seafood paella. Everything was fresh and tasty.
A special mention for the staff. They all were very polite and nice with us. Try it, it's worth it!"
ChIJjZmkun4oQg0RJ6HnwMmqlSI,5,"Service exceptional and always adaptable! Traditional atmosphere which allows you to experience Spanish culture!

We asked for gamba crudo which is normally not served in this restaurant however they served it with love!

Thankful for giving us a table in Good Friday"
ChIJiSxMTComQg0RgRLq52sv8lg,5,"Most tasty and authentic paella in Madrid!! A perfect ambiance and hospitality. Highly recommended! However, please note that currently this place is only open for lunch. Maybe they will be open for dinner in the summer. So, I suggest you call them first to confirm their opening time."
ChIJiSxMTComQg0RgRLq52sv8lg,5,"We went there two days in a row. Fresh ingredients, cozy and home-like atmosphere and the service staff is terrific. When I come back to Spain I will be going back for sure. A MUST visit!"
ChIJiSxMTComQg0RgRLq52sv8lg,5,"We ordered the banana paella, which is seafood version. The rice was full of seafood flavor! The restaurant owner gave us some garlic cream to try. It was delicious to mix it with the paella. They got nice vermut as well!"
ChIJiSxMTComQg0RgRLq52sv8lg,5,"This is an excellent paella restaurant, off the beaten path but worth it. Had the Arroz Viudo con Bacalao and the Ensaladilla Rusa. Highly recommended."
ChIJiSxMTComQg0RgRLq52sv8lg,5,Great paella. Good wine. Get a reservation before. They snuck us in but you should get one
ChIJ3aNabn4oQg0RUZW-XLWz1e8,5,"Stepping into Casa Labra is like stepping back in time‚Äîa place where history lingers in the air, where the walls whisper stories of Madrid‚Äôs past, and where tradition is not just preserved but revered. This centenary tavern remains a beacon of authenticity, offering a glimpse into an era when craftsmanship, honor, and a commitment to doing things right were paramount.

The star of the menu is, without question, the bacalao in its two legendary forms: the fried cod‚Äîgolden, flaky, and infused with a delicate brininess that speaks of the sea‚Äîand the bacalao croquettes, which are nothing short of exquisite. Each bite delivers a perfect contrast between the crisp exterior and the creamy, flavorful interior, a testament to generations of perfected technique.

To accompany these delicacies, a vermouth de grifo is the only logical choice. Served just as it should be‚Äîcold, aromatic, and with just the right balance of bitterness‚Äîit heightens the experience, making each sip feel like a small celebration of Madrid‚Äôs culinary heritage.

If there‚Äôs one drawback, it‚Äôs the payment system, which remains oddly disjointed. Having to place an order at a separate register before collecting it at the bar adds an unnecessary layer of complexity, disrupting the otherwise seamless experience.

Yet, this is a small inconvenience in a place that embodies the soul of Madrid. The timeless d√©cor, untouched by fleeting trends, transports you to a more dignified era‚Äîone where refinement and tradition reigned supreme. Casa Labra is not just a meal; it is an experience, a pilgrimage to the very essence of Madrid‚Äôs culinary legacy."
ChIJ3aNabn4oQg0RUZW-XLWz1e8,4,"A bit of a background: It's my first time, a solo diner, speak very little Spanish (Duolingo!) and I don't eat pork.
With all that, a busy place with a queue can be daunting but I heard about this place and I wanted to try it.
I queued up and didn't realise that it was the non-sit down queue. No matter because I was fine with standing.
In my broken Spanish, I managed to understand that what was served had no pork. Found out that the queue for a drink is at the bar and was told where I can stand to eat. Sure, I felt unsure but I think it's worth it. The cod fish and croquet were delicious.
I could probably have a dozen if I had some chili sauce though! So for this time, I had one of each."
ChIJ3aNabn4oQg0RUZW-XLWz1e8,5,"I was afraid this was going to be just another hyped up tourist trap but luckily, it really lives up to the hype‚Ä¶ almost perfect fried cod ‚ÄúBacallo‚Äù should not be missed, as well as the crispy fried fish croquettes with a cold beer‚Ä¶ excellent!! This was our second time here and we will make sure we visit every time we are in Madrid"
ChIJ3aNabn4oQg0RUZW-XLWz1e8,4,"Food was good - way too popular now and therefore the experience is one of tourist perspective and prices. Queues just to get a drink? It's nice vermouth, but that's not unique anywhere in Spain"
ChIJ3aNabn4oQg0RUZW-XLWz1e8,5,"I love places that specialize in one or two dishes and perfect them. The fried Bacala was perfect. Better than any fish at any fish & chip shop anywhere. The croquetas were fantastic, crunchy on the outside and mushy on the inside. Take those, with a cerveza or a vermut and you‚Äôre set!"
ChIJYVaoZ4IoQg0RY8cfkKpcr5k,4,"I enjoyed a nice lunch at this little restaurant in Madrid. There was a little confusion at first about what part of the menu was available (and it was not in english as a lot of places have multiple languages) I think it either had to do with the time of day or sitting at a table vs the bar. Regardless, I was happy with the large portion of perfected breaded and fried cod. Service was friendly, I would recommend it."
ChIJYVaoZ4IoQg0RY8cfkKpcr5k,5,Fantastic Cocido Madrileno!! This place is a must of you want to try this typical Madrid plate!
ChIJYVaoZ4IoQg0RY8cfkKpcr5k,5,I think this is my favorite restaurant in Madrid. They have excellent tapas and it is very cheap if you eat in the bar area. The ambience is also a bit cool and it's a fun place for a cold beer or wine.
ChIJYVaoZ4IoQg0RY8cfkKpcr5k,4,"Very local place to have tapas and cocido. Cozy place with friendly staff super busy.
Food is excellent"
ChIJYVaoZ4IoQg0RY8cfkKpcr5k,5,"This was the best food we had in Spain. We haven‚Äôt had better eggplant (berenjenas), the white asparagus was excellent (esparragos navarros), the fried potatoes memorable (patatas bravas). The eggs with sausage did the trick for the boy (huevos patatas y chorizos). Delicate, fresh gazpacho. The fried fish with with ratatouille was wonderful and perfectly paired (bacalao rebozado con pisto).  I gulped down the cold beer. Bustling atmosphere filled with regulars, families, and travelers. Vintage decor, with framed awards lining the entire walls. Old school bar chirping with conversation among old friends and happy bartenders tending clinking glass. Would return in a heartbeat."
ChIJC1mMs2IoQg0RHO0GIgvRfTc,5,"We walked down to this restaurant because it had looked pretty in the cab ride back from Atocha and was on the same block as our hotel.

We showed up around 8pm on a rainy Friday night without a reservation (the host asked) and were promptly seated downstairs which worked great for us.

The ambiance was really fun, we had English on our menus, and a rather American selection of food. My husband enjoyed his burger and I had a beet-based veggie burger. My mojito was delicious."
ChIJC1mMs2IoQg0RHO0GIgvRfTc,5,"Dining at this Italian restaurant was a fantastic experience. The lively atmosphere didn't feel rushed at all, even with the full bar and kitchen working at full speed. The staff handled everything with ease, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable meal. The salad and shrimp were standouts‚Äîthe flavors were well-balanced and fresh. I definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone who appreciates great food and attention to detail."
ChIJC1mMs2IoQg0RHO0GIgvRfTc,1,"Their steak was awful, full of unchewable meat and fat. And it was the highest priced item on the menu. I refused to finish struggling through the meat. Even the potatoes were undercooked. The best things I ate were the mushrooms and the oxtail taco appetizer. Which for it being a shareable appetizer they literally give you two small tacos. What a disappointment. Don't bother coming here."
ChIJC1mMs2IoQg0RHO0GIgvRfTc,5,"Downtown venue with rooms that are larger and more spacious than typical Madrid restaurants. I had a poke with tuna and then tarta de queso. Both very good. Prices are high, but considering the location it fits. Very friendly staff."
ChIJC1mMs2IoQg0RHO0GIgvRfTc,4,"What a place in the downtown of Madrid. It is really a cool place quite low key, like a Bristol. The ambience and the setting is super nice. The food choice and taste superb. Total value for money and you will enjoy a lot. Remember to book a table or you can‚Äôt find a table. Definitely recommended."
ChIJc9hNPIEoQg0RGbuz4joJFVY,5,"Beautiful, large restaurant with continuous opening hours, friendly staff, great menu, and large selection of wines. The paella is generous and delicious!"
ChIJc9hNPIEoQg0RGbuz4joJFVY,5,"Absolutely stunning place. The staff are second to none, the food is fresh and delicious, and it's very reasonably priced in my opinion. Don't hesitate to go here!"
ChIJc9hNPIEoQg0RGbuz4joJFVY,5,"We stumbled upon this beautiful restaurant and honestly have to say it was one of the best meals we had on our trip to Spain. We got the chicken and veal entrees and the flavors - the sauces, tender meat, accompanying potatoes and veggies - were absolutely amazing! It‚Äôs a beautiful restaurant. We will definitely make a point to go back next time we return to Madrid. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough."
ChIJc9hNPIEoQg0RGbuz4joJFVY,5,"Loved the food and the ambiance, wide range of wine collection to choose from, menu has a highlighted section of recommended dishes! Quantity was good, tasty as well! Would definitely recommend it!"
ChIJc9hNPIEoQg0RGbuz4joJFVY,5,"A must-be restaurant in Madrid! Atmosphere is amazibg with stunning internal deco, staff is so polite and friendly, and most of all the food is state-of-art but also very affordable. Strongly recommend shrimp carpaccio, baby octopus and tim beon!! Local guide's recommendation led us here, and this resto is definitly a hidden jewel of the city."
ChIJjSaUBCYmQg0R4hssYfNoRcw,4,"A must in Madrid

We've now been here twice during our stay in Madrid, and it's easy to see why it's always busy. This spot serves up a local favourite ‚Äî a soft baguette filled with freshly cooked calamari ‚Äî and they do it very well. Today we also tried the steak sandwich alongside a couple of local beers, and both hit the spot.

They‚Äôve got a queuing system for seating on either the front or back terrace. It may look long, but don‚Äôt let that put you off ‚Äî the line moves quickly.

Everything is fresh, tasty, and great value. If you go for the calamari baguette (which I highly recommend), make sure to grab the little sachet of aioli ‚Äî it‚Äôs a game-changer. Honestly, best price and quality combo we‚Äôve found in Madrid. We‚Äôll definitely be back."
ChIJjSaUBCYmQg0R4hssYfNoRcw,5,"El Brillante is such a unique spot‚Äîit‚Äôs a must-visit if you‚Äôre in Madrid. The atmosphere is vibrant and full of energy, making it feel truly authentic. I tried their bocadillo con calamares, and it was incredible! The calamari was perfectly fried, tender, and paired with fresh, crusty bread. It‚Äôs a simple dish, but they do it so well. What I loved most was the unpretentious vibe that made the experience even better. If you‚Äôre looking for a taste of Madrid‚Äôs charm and flavor, you won‚Äôt want to miss this place!"
ChIJjSaUBCYmQg0R4hssYfNoRcw,4,I couldn't believe that this very well known establishment (famous for its calamari sandwich) was just a stone's throw from my accommodation! I had just arrived in Madrid from Paris and was very hungry once dinner time came around. I had dinner slightly late and I ordered the croquettes and the calamari sandwich for dinner and downed it with tinto de verano. My first time trying tinto de verano and I can't say that it's my favourite but not to fear there is so much on the beverage menu but I don't think it's all listed on the actual menu from what I saw. My waiter was telling me to slow down and he was so right because I struggled to finish my dinner (but I did finish it as I don't like to waste food) so I'd advise to start small if it's your first time and you're dining alone. I did like my calamari sandwich but it was a bit dry and I discovered later that you need to ask for lemon slices and mayonnaise (and possibly other sauces?). I find it strange that the lemon slices aren't offered by default though. I liked this spot so much that I came back for brunch the next day and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The Spanish omelette had great flavour and the bread is fresh as always but I really love butter and I feel like fresh bread needs a generous spread of butter or at least offered as an option for us butter lovers. Also ordered tea with milk and sugar (I'm a tea lover and have to have a cup with my first meal of the day) and a glass of orange juice. The orange juice tasted so fresh and delicious and I would've been happy to have a litre of it! Waiters are nice and very animated with their fellow waiters and even the chef and bartenders. It's kind of like watching a show whilst you're dining! It's not a fancy place at all (in fact the stools are very uncomfortable - perhaps this is on purpose) but all you really need is good food prepared with love and served with speed. Great location and the fans are on high speed so you won't melt if it isn't super busy.
ChIJjSaUBCYmQg0R4hssYfNoRcw,4,"Bar El Brilliante: simple food, decent prices, local charm. No frills, just good eats and a genuine neighborhood vibe. A true local staple."
ChIJjSaUBCYmQg0R4hssYfNoRcw,5,"Sometimes you come across a restaurant that you know is for you. El Brillante was exactly that, full of locals and tourists alike serving simple foods in an incredible location. We had the bocadillos, one Calamari and the other Chorizo. Served on extremely fresh rolls they were very good. Along with ice cold Cokes made for a perfect lunch. We sat on the patio with views of the beautiful architecture surrounding the busy roundabout. An experience not to be missed."
ChIJu09cHoIoQg0RUDyopyzgAVE,5,"Our party of 3 had a fantastic dinner.  We made a reservation via Google.  The restaurant was not crowded for our Friday night at 8:30 PM reservation.  The traditional, basque vibe was very enjoyable.  The food was delicious and service attentive.  The only change I would make is softer lighting.  That said, we would gladly dine here again."
ChIJu09cHoIoQg0RUDyopyzgAVE,5,"Authentic Bask restaurant, definitely worth visit. Good cidra & wines, nice kitchen."
ChIJu09cHoIoQg0RUDyopyzgAVE,5,"Great steak and cider, very nice atmosphere.
Highly recommend!!"
ChIJu09cHoIoQg0RUDyopyzgAVE,5,Lovely restaurant with very friendly service. The food was amazing and had lots of vegetarian friendly options. We had the best time.
ChIJu09cHoIoQg0RUDyopyzgAVE,5,"This place deserved 6-stars.   Food, service and ambiance were all top notch!   Will dine here next time we are in Madrid."
ChIJl810pIMoQg0R7Jl5s3ZVjAM,5,"Being in the area we came to this restaurant by google and based on the positive comments we decided to have lunch at PARADIS. They have changed their menu to ‚ÄúFestival de Tapas‚Äù. I was with some friends and we decided to order a variety of Tapas. Excelente quality and very nice presentation, reasonable price and very profesional service. Definitely  a place to visit for lunch or dinner when you are in Madrid.
Leticia, the director showed us the rest of the facilities and they have several private rooms, for business use or for family reunion, with the possibility to adjust the menu to your needs and budget."
ChIJl810pIMoQg0R7Jl5s3ZVjAM,5,"A nice traditional Mediterranean restaurant with a reasonably priced selection of great quality food. Exquisite service and great location in the city center. Fish are really best choice here,  notigh againts the meat here  but it is easier to find a good meat that a well prepared fish as the have here."
ChIJl810pIMoQg0R7Jl5s3ZVjAM,5,"We reserved the Anna private room in this restaurant to celebrate my friend's birthday. The service was extraordinary, delicate and discreet! The meal (the menu at 50 ‚Ç¨) was wonderful and very generous, I can only recommend this restaurant. Thank you to the whole team for making this anniversary day unforgettable THANK YOU Fred Copp."
ChIJl810pIMoQg0R7Jl5s3ZVjAM,1,"I don‚Äôt recommend this place. They charged ‚Ç¨3.50 for water and ‚Ç¨3.50 for sparkling water and never refilled the glasses. Our bottles were sitting on the counter and the waiter was never around.
My dish came without vegetables (in the menu it said seasonal fish with vegetables).
Poor service and food is not the same as described in the menu. Will not come back."
ChIJl810pIMoQg0R7Jl5s3ZVjAM,4,Good restaurant for large groups
ChIJ5YRJ0ikmQg0R8Y1Kby--zmk,4,It‚Äôs been 10 years since I ate here. Still quite tasty and simple fare at good prices. Kind service in a rustic style room. Worth a visit. Pacing of the meal is slow as noted in other reviews but still a good experience.
ChIJ5YRJ0ikmQg0R8Y1Kby--zmk,5,"Really great little Galician tapas bar for the locals gets a 5/5.

Great food and selection including lots of amazing and fresh seafood, meat, veggies in traditional Galician and Spanish dishes.

Great selection of drinks including local beers, wine and sangria.

Great value but not necessarily ‚Äòcheap‚Äô.

We went twice and everything was great, including the warm and friendly service. It was a recommendation from a friend from Madrid.

Highly recommend."
ChIJ5YRJ0ikmQg0R8Y1Kby--zmk,3,"An interesting place, but unfortunately overcrowded. The staff doesn't speak any English that I can understand. We tried to figure it out with a vocabulary but there was no effort. Meals over salted - probably they want the guests to order more drinks. Unfortunately, not recommended, there are better places in Madrid."
ChIJ5YRJ0ikmQg0R8Y1Kby--zmk,4,"Authentic Traditional food in a rustic and colorful location. Really enjoyed the food: we had a tortilla, ""Pulpo"" with potatoes, and Fava beans soup with clams.

Pro: good quality of the food, authentic experience, great vibes, very strategic location, funny and playful personnel.

Cons: Spanish men√∫, so it took us a while to understand what to order. Strongly suggest you to prepare your favourite translator app to be faster.

Neutral: fair price, not particularly fast kitchen (considering the food quality and presentation, perfectly understandable).

Overall unique experience, strongly suggested!"
ChIJ5YRJ0ikmQg0R8Y1Kby--zmk,3,"Food 4 stars, service 2 stars, thus the average of 3 stars. Servers tended to be forgetful and spoke no english. Final bill did not match the menu prices, but as the servers spoke no english, I just did not want to argue.

Also food took really long time to arrive and in no particular order"
ChIJtQtEDSomQg0ReqMevJRvrq0,2,"If you want to fill your belly at a low cost this is the place, the menu is very filling, that‚Äôs it. The waiter was really nice and patient. The place is old but not well maintained, small area that feels too crowded and the flavor on the dishes is not existent."
ChIJtQtEDSomQg0ReqMevJRvrq0,5,"Even though I am a non-Spanish speaking tourist, I was always treated correctly and fairly. I came here four times, twice for morning coffee and twice for lunch. Each time I was very satisfied with the service, the drinks, the food quality and quantity as well as with the value for money."
ChIJtQtEDSomQg0ReqMevJRvrq0,4,Friendly staff. They serve breakfast for 10euro and good coffee with milk. Good value for it location.
ChIJtQtEDSomQg0ReqMevJRvrq0,1,Awful place to eat. The only thing good was the vegetables. The Paella is what you see in the photo. Yellow rice with 2 shrimps . It was the worst restaurant i went in Madrid . Not even the coffee...
ChIJtQtEDSomQg0ReqMevJRvrq0,4,"Very good Paella Marinera and Caldo Gallego.

The restaurant is very little but it seems to have a second floor room.

Very good location and good taste of food. Spanish plates for lunch and dinner. Also good for a cold ca√±ita in summer time."
ChIJfYXddIEoQg0R9Zt1z5W1cbw,5,"Service is excellent. All staff friendly and welcoming regardless of your language abilities. You‚Äôll need a smartphone to access the menu. Strong WiFi provided. We had beef tenderloin and a side of vegetables. If you ask for medium, expect it to not have much crust. I‚Äôll include a photo. Roasted vegetables   Included a variety of julienne: red bell pepper, green bell pepper, zucchini, carrot, with a bunch of thinly sliced leeks. We were glad to have chosen them. Be aware there are two dining rooms, one across the narrow lane from the other; best to look for a sign with a stylized anchor. Buen provecho."
ChIJfYXddIEoQg0R9Zt1z5W1cbw,5,WOW! The steaks are fantastic! Cooked to perfection and very flavorful. One of the best steaks I've ever had and if you have seen any of my reviews you know I love steak! I had the ribeye with french fries. All the starter's we had we're excellent and the sides we're also great. The wine we had was a Spanish red and complimented the steaks very well. We had cocktails to start and all of them were great. Also the service and staff were superb. If your in Madrid city center and want a steak with a fine dining experience this place is for you!
ChIJfYXddIEoQg0R9Zt1z5W1cbw,5,"This restaurant is a true gem! The grilled steaks were perfect, octopus was great, they are offering a wonderful selection of wines and cocktails. Desserts are just divine. The atmosphere is inviting. Absolute recommended."
ChIJfYXddIEoQg0R9Zt1z5W1cbw,5,"Delicious food cuisines from Argentina and Italy. Our starters, the entrees, and the drinks were all delicious. Table service could‚Äôve been better as I had to flag down our waiters multiple times. Place has two physical locations with lots of seating across from each other. Reservations are highly recommended but we did also come early and lucked out with a walk-in."
ChIJfYXddIEoQg0R9Zt1z5W1cbw,5,"Best Carpaccio I ever ate and tasty steak for good price. French fries are also very tasty and not greasy. I watched Real Madrid game against Man. City, and after victory, the atmosphere was extra good :)"
ChIJxc3PCIEoQg0RE3zA5okGlls,4,"‚ÄèAn incredible flamenco show! The energy, passion, and talent of the performers were truly impressive. The atmosphere was intimate and intense, which made the experience even more special. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Madrid."
ChIJxc3PCIEoQg0RE3zA5okGlls,5,"We had a tiny problem with the staff who were selling the tickets. They showed us where the tickets are that we were buying and they sat us completely somewhere else where was hard to see but
the  show was the best ‚ú® we had a great night they were very professional and this was my best experience"
ChIJxc3PCIEoQg0RE3zA5okGlls,5,"I had an absolutely incredible experience at Cardamomo Tablao Flamenco! The atmosphere was vibrant, the performances were breathtaking, and the passion of the artists was truly mesmerizing. Every dancer, musician, and singer gave their all, making it an unforgettable night filled with energy and emotion.

A special thank you to Valeria for providing all the information and recommending this amazing place! Her enthusiasm and knowledge made the experience even better, and I‚Äôm so grateful for her guidance. If you‚Äôre looking for an authentic and unforgettable flamenco show, Cardamomo is the perfect choice. Highly recommended!"
ChIJxc3PCIEoQg0RE3zA5okGlls,5,Great show! Great night! Best part of my trip. We loved all the dancers and the sangria. Highly recommended. Thank you Valeria for recommending the best seats in the venue.
ChIJxc3PCIEoQg0RE3zA5okGlls,4,"Easy online reservations. I did see people get seats just by walking in too. Ticket includes one drink. The show lasts about an hour and started on time.

I got a seat in the middle and still had a good view as the stage is elevated. There were 3 dancers, the male dancer Jose Escarpin was fantastic.  The 2 female dancers were technically strong but I felt their performances were a bit less inspired. The musicians were great, but they use a microphone for the singers and sometimes the sound quality is not the best. The lighting also kept coming in and out oddly.

I watch flamenco frequently and this venue is lovely but they let audience members come late (like 30 mins late). So multiple times I couldn't see because people were walking in and out,  ordering drinks loudly. I think it was disruptive for the performers as well. I ordered a tapa of tortilla which was good, but the server was trying to get me to pay while the performers were on stage. I wanted to wait until there was a break, so I could focus on the show and not fish out cash from my wallet but my server made me feel a bit rushed to settle the bill.

The audience seemed to be mostly tourists who don't know flamenco. Nothing wrong with that but just to be aware.  The performance is authentic but the audience doesn't really give jaleos or anything. I did appreciate there are signs in the lobby and info in a tablet at each table to explain the history of the tablao and different characteristics of flamenco and each palo. I like that they are trying to educate the audience and hopefully create more flamenco aficianoados."
ChIJi0vRVCkmQg0RhJD1GJk3jkU,4,"We tried to come here on a Friday evening around 9pm but left after 20 min. We then tried again at 12.30 on Sunday and were able to get a table at the bar area quickly. The croquettes, callaos, and Russian salad were delicious and full of flavor. But the snail dish was overly salted. Still it was a great experience eating at a restaurant with so much history."
ChIJi0vRVCkmQg0RhJD1GJk3jkU,5,We had our first dinner here and enjoyed the great food. The service was awesome too and they made us feel welcome. They made good recommendations for the food. We will definitely come back for another round. We had to wait a bit to get a table but it was definitely worth it!
ChIJi0vRVCkmQg0RhJD1GJk3jkU,5,"Our Bike tour guide Manuel recommended this place. One of the best places that we ate at in Madrid! Must try the squid sandwich, burrata, and jamon! Best Squid Sandwich I had in Madrid!"
ChIJi0vRVCkmQg0RhJD1GJk3jkU,2,"Casa Alberto is a historic bar and restaurant since 1827. I was recommended to visit this place. The restaurant is beautiful. However the service is VERY VERY ULTRA BAD. The worst in the world. I asked the waiter for recommended food to eat, he just ignore me, and asked me to choose anything. Very rude attitude and racist. I ordered the pepper with shrimp and cod topas, it was good. I also ordered the veal meat balls but very disappointed. The meat balls are dried and not tasty. I will not go back there to waste my money"
ChIJi0vRVCkmQg0RhJD1GJk3jkU,5,Super delicious! A friendly restaurant offer great food and drinks! Fresh draft beer and nice Sangria!!!
ChIJq4-kc4EoQg0R7eDDJ8AH-R0,5,"Loved loved loved. Vegetarian heaven! They have vegan options too. Everything was a knockout. I really don‚Äôt think you can go wrong here. The guacamole and chips are a classic, the apple juice is so fresh and omg the eggplant was so crispy and not greasy at all. Wonderful, highly recommend and want to come back as soon as possible."
ChIJq4-kc4EoQg0R7eDDJ8AH-R0,5,"I had the Vegan Tasting Platter just for myself (it‚Äôs meant for two, but I was really hungry üôà), and it was absolutely delicious! I wanted to try the curry from another dish, and they happily swapped the quinoa for it(such a nice touch)!
I still had some room, so I went for the vegan carrot cake, and it was totally worth itüòç.
The service was super friendly, and I will definitely be back on my next visit to Madrid. Highly recommended! üíö"
ChIJq4-kc4EoQg0R7eDDJ8AH-R0,5,Wow! Some of the best food I‚Äôve had in Madrid! I loved their daily menu but we also got their croquettes! Everything was delicious and we loved the mandarin cake! The vegetarian paella was delicious and highly recommend this gem!
ChIJq4-kc4EoQg0R7eDDJ8AH-R0,5,"Being a vegetarian in Spain, especially one who hates eating at 8:30 pm means a lot of veggie burgers so thank goodness for lunch at Artemisa in Madrid. Three course delicious lunch for 15 euros. Going back tomorrow!"
ChIJq4-kc4EoQg0R7eDDJ8AH-R0,5,"Best combination of a vegetarian and gluten free. Friendly staff, tasty food and a diverse menu at a fair price."
ChIJMzLLbYEoQg0RPYCn9X1JteQ,3,"Cute place in the centre. Food is a bit weak, so would not go there to have a meal.

Instead, swing by to enjoy its atmosphere and have a coffee or a beer. Service is friendly and very cordial.

The arroz con leche I had was cooked to perfection, but had no sweetness to it. A bit odd, but works side by side with an espresso (without sugar of course).

Coffee is good üòÅ"
ChIJMzLLbYEoQg0RPYCn9X1JteQ,5,"Excellent cafe bar for breakfast or lunch. Cosy atmosphere and local food and beverages. Also, the prices are fair and the service excellent. I recommend."
ChIJMzLLbYEoQg0RPYCn9X1JteQ,5,"Came across this place by accident for breakfast. Glad I walked in. Family owned establishment. Very kind and patient with me as a tried my best to speak Spanish. Enjoyed an egg and ham sandwich and great coffee. Very clean banos, too!"
ChIJMzLLbYEoQg0RPYCn9X1JteQ,5,"Great place with the best service in Madrid ;) Nice interior, delicious toasts with ham, cheese and egg! We love this place!"
ChIJMzLLbYEoQg0RPYCn9X1JteQ,5,"This is a great little place with excellent friendly service, good food and frequented by locals providing a lovely atmosphere.  Ideal for breakfast."
ChIJl0IKpIEoQg0R02EPZ-0wnwo,5,"Absolutely amazing! We had a fantastic dining experience at this restaurant. The four of us tried chipirones a la plancha, pimientos de padr√≥n, chopitos fritos, and tabla de carne, and these dishes were simply amazing. The service was super fast. We visited the restaurant on a quite busy Sunday evening and didn‚Äôt have to wait long at all.

It would be better if they offered sangria in 500ml or 750ml options, as the only available size on the menu was 1.5L, which is too much. We didn‚Äôt have the courage to order it since two of our friends were drinking beer.

The restaurant is very centrally located, just a 5-minute walk from Puerta del Sol. Apart from that, El Lac√≥n is a must-try!"
ChIJl0IKpIEoQg0R02EPZ-0wnwo,5,"We visited during an oganised tour, the place is very small inside, outseide just a dew tables and all packed up. The atmoshere was awsome, noisy and full of life, everybody was talking, waiters rushing around. There is an open kitchen and the decorations are old and cosy. We had red/white wine, Pedron green peppers, Tripe with chickpeas, marinated doggeon ( which is the best thing I ever had in Spain) and ham with potato. Highly recommend !"
ChIJl0IKpIEoQg0R02EPZ-0wnwo,5,"Located on a fairly quiet street near many hotels, just far enough off the mains to find more reasonable prices. The fresh-made seafood paella was well worth the 30 minute wait. Lots of tender calamari and mussels plus clams, crab and 1 giant shrimp per person.

Excellent sangria. Superior service. The proprietor Senor George, his wife Madeline and son Pablo are a delight to be with.

Outdoor seating available. I highly recommend it. We have already been there twice and will definitely go back again."
ChIJl0IKpIEoQg0R02EPZ-0wnwo,5,This place is a Spanish classic! Huge portions. Great experience.
ChIJl0IKpIEoQg0R02EPZ-0wnwo,5,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è great place to be.
Amazing free tapas with every drink.
Great atmosphere. 5‚≠êÔ∏èto the tapas bar downstairs.
However, the food in the restaurant ranged from 3 to 4 ‚≠êÔ∏è not helped by our sullen waiter. Atmosphere is still great so was very happy to visit."
ChIJ2SYbnIMoQg0ReztwwfW4iek,5,"We discovered a gem of an authentic Indian restaurant walking distance from El Centro. When we entered, we were consumed with the fragrant aromas of cumin, turmeric, Garam masala, cardamom, and garlic.

In short, the cuisine was amazing. But the service and kindness was equal to the cuisine.

We even sent photos to our Indian friends in Jaipur.

Highly recommend!"
ChIJ2SYbnIMoQg0ReztwwfW4iek,5,"Very delicious food , staff very friendly , everything is amazing you have to try it"
ChIJ2SYbnIMoQg0ReztwwfW4iek,5,"My husband and I wanted to find a restaurant near the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum after leaving the Prado. I wanted to go here because I missed Indian food and they have a menu of the day for ‚Ç¨14.50.

We arrived around 2 pm and the restaurant was full but we only had a short wait for a table. This is definitely not a tourist restaurant which is good. The menu of the day includes 2 courses, naan, beverage, dessert, and either coffee or tea.

The selection for the courses differs depending on the day of the week. We were there on a Tuesday and chose the chicken samosa and pakora as our first course. This came with a variety of chutneys, I recognized the tamarind and mint cilantro chutneys but the others were unfamiliar. The chicken samosa was tasty, the pakora was very different from what we have in the US but tasted fine. For our second course, we ordered the chicken curry. This also included rice. We both liked the flavor of the curry. My husband had a beer and I had a glass of red wine. For dessert, you could select an Indian dessert like gulab jamun or kheer or a western-style dessert. We chose the chocolate cake and also had tea. I thought we had ordered chai tea but it was mint flavored which was strange. This was a delicious lunch and a great value."
ChIJ2SYbnIMoQg0ReztwwfW4iek,5,"My very favorite Indian restaurant in Madrid. The food is delicious and staff is eager to help and recommend the right dish for you. Portions are quite big, even though it doesn't look like. It's always good to make reservations as this place is almost always full :)"
ChIJ2SYbnIMoQg0ReztwwfW4iek,4,"I already had better Indian food, but overall it was a good experience and I would come back to try something different. The staff was very polite"
ChIJ916ciycmQg0RCGrUvI8fTKM,5,"A very nice place with delicious food. Excellent and attentive service. My recommendation for the staff is to always check the dishes before serving, as ours was chipped. But overall, the experience was very positive."
ChIJ916ciycmQg0RCGrUvI8fTKM,5,Four for lunch outside. Engaging and fun service. Excellent location. Beef cheeks are top notch as is the risotto. Artichokes presentation is beautiful. Even the burger was best my mate had eaten in Spain. Can‚Äôt comment on wine list sorry. It‚Äôs hot so I drank beer!  Can comfortably recommend.
ChIJ916ciycmQg0RCGrUvI8fTKM,1,"Disorganised and not very accommodating service, food mediocre at its best. They forgot the beer order three times, and never came. And the best for last‚Ä¶ they charge additional 1,5‚Ç¨ per plate if you sit outside!! In Greece there is never an extra charge for enjoying the sunshine!"
ChIJ916ciycmQg0RCGrUvI8fTKM,5,Very nice place to stop for a drink in the evening sun if you're coming out of the Prado. or at any other time I guess.
ChIJ916ciycmQg0RCGrUvI8fTKM,1,"We had a very bad experience with them! They brought the food, but never any sylverware, napkins, salt...anything!  We sat there for 10 minutes just staring at the food and nobody cared. Attempts to tell the waitress failed, my wife went to her and while  talking to her she just turned arround and left like I don't care..another interesting thing is 10Euro for stuff we didn't order, so, we put our order and after a while she brings us bread(which most restaurants do on the house which is normal) and with my beer they just brought some olives(we didn't order but thought this is how they do, they bring olives to every beer customer orders)...so, we ended up paying 10 Euro for these extras: bread and olives, you cannot charge customers for stuff they didn't order, this looks like a scam to me plus bad service, please avoid this place, there are many other places to go."
ChIJl1SpTIAoQg0R0cZk-OZCkDA,3,"We were recommended this Tapas restaurant as one being the the oldest (1904) in Madrid located at Plaza Santa Ana. The plaza itself is busy and happening. There was a group dancing to music on headphones. Another one doing circus tricks. We had to wait a few mino to get a table. Ordered a beer some wine and   A mixed plates of Ham and Cod Croquettes which were good, we then had the cod tempura which was not crispy and had no taste, the sausage was good and came with a single sausage with small sides of coleslaw, and sauerkraut"
ChIJl1SpTIAoQg0R0cZk-OZCkDA,3,"Good tortilla and tapas options, very old place with rustic decoration, the service could improve but if you‚Äôre in the area you should go in."
ChIJl1SpTIAoQg0R0cZk-OZCkDA,5,"Hemingway visited here and so did we. You have to have drinks and food here,he did. üòéüòéüòé"
ChIJl1SpTIAoQg0R0cZk-OZCkDA,3,"Nice traditional Madrid bar atmosphere in the Santa Ana square area, although it is not what once it used to be. Service was rather slow, food portions were small and overpriced. It looks like the place became complacent offering a mediocre service because they are in a great location and people are constantly comming in and out anyway."
ChIJl1SpTIAoQg0R0cZk-OZCkDA,5,"I was surprised to see negative reviews for the service. Our service was as expected and probably even better than we've experienced in many other restaurants in Europe.
The tortillas (Spanish omelette) were large and quite delicious. We also enjoyed the meatballs and empanadilla de at√∫n (tuna empanada)."
ChIJdWjcdYEoQg0R8huusXh-WWo,5,"The place was nicely decorated and generally quite quiet. Servers were helpful despite some of them may not understand English fully.

Food were on the higher price scale but tasted good enough to be worth the price. Both the seafood paella and the black rice (squid paella) took at least 40mins to be ready to serve so make sure you order early on.

Personally loved the black rice the most. It was rich in taste and not too salty. The seafood was fresh and had a good texture."
ChIJdWjcdYEoQg0R8huusXh-WWo,5,"Today I had a very good and satisfying meal at this restaurant. The waiters are all very handsome. Miguel is handsome and courteous. I had seafood paella, white wine, water, and bread with hummus dip. All the food and drinks are very good. The paella tasted so good and I finished it all, supposed to be for 2 persons ! The r service is good too. Restaurant is beautiful"
ChIJdWjcdYEoQg0R8huusXh-WWo,5,"We had an amazing experience at Arrocer√≠a Marina Ventura. The food was delicious, with fresh ingredients and perfectly balanced flavors - they really are rice-experts! The service was exceptional‚Äîattentive, friendly, and efficient. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making it a great spot for a special night out.

One thing to note: a reservation is definitely necessary, as the restaurant is quite popular and the rice dishes take a while to be prepared. Totally worth it! Looking forward to coming back."
ChIJdWjcdYEoQg0R8huusXh-WWo,5,"A lovely restaurant with attentive and friendly staff. We enjoyed the seafood paella, which was absolutely delicious, especially the perfectly cooked rice. The complimentary dish of crunchy breadsticks paired with a dip made of goat cheese, smoked salmon, olive oil, and other ingredients was incredible and elevated the experience.

The paella is priced per person, making it a bit more expensive, but the quality and flavor make it well worth it. Highly recommend this place!"
ChIJdWjcdYEoQg0R8huusXh-WWo,5,A really nice lunch after a walk in the botanic garden. Many choices of starters and many types of paellas. We ordered grilled cuttlefish which was incredible and the other fried starters were also good. The paella was quite big and the seafood cooked well. Really recommend it!
ChIJBWMegCcmQg0Rl61GCW828Tw,1,"Having traveled all thru Italy many times I thought a good Italian meal would be nice after two weeks in Spain. To be blunt, an Italian chef would be embarrassed to eat here. Everything had cream: pesto pasta, truffle pasta and more. The lasagna bolognese had no meat too much mascarpone cheese and was tasteless. The veal Marsala was thick with flour ( see photo ) and to top it off the waiter brought all pastas and veal at the same time. A terrible experience"
ChIJBWMegCcmQg0Rl61GCW828Tw,5,"Really nice place to eat, the food is great!
We started with a Beef Carpaccio that was served over a thin round flat bread, arugula, & Parmigiano Riggiano, amazing!
As entree I had a Spaghetti Frutti di Mare, spectacular!!
Great service!
Highly recommend!"
ChIJBWMegCcmQg0Rl61GCW828Tw,4,"Nice place. The food is great.
We sat outside at the terrance, pay attation its 20% more if you choose to sit outside.

The service outside a bit problematic because only one waiter who go inside all the time.

Total good experience"
ChIJBWMegCcmQg0Rl61GCW828Tw,5,Incredible italian restaurant in the centre of Madrid. The food all looks very appetising and is reasonably priced. As an italian i approve!
ChIJBWMegCcmQg0Rl61GCW828Tw,2,"We stopped by for a quick lunch and were quite surprised by the pleasant, warm atmosphere inside the restaurant. The food was prepared quickly and was tasty. Unfortunately no one ever offered us any drinks during the whole visit, nor did the waiters check upon us during lunch. There is a definite need for a drastic improvement of service etiquette and customer attention!"
ChIJyQ-zmIEoQg0RExML5hShXGg,5,"We enjoyed a lovely dinner here in Madrid after walking by in the afternoon and seeing people outside eating enormous bowls of mussels. Our server was very friendly and the food was delicious. Besides the mussels, we also enjoyed wonderfully garlicky scallops and a ravioli entree. Highly recommended!"
ChIJyQ-zmIEoQg0RExML5hShXGg,5,"Amazing food, causal atmosphere. Great menu, I got the veal cheeks in red wine sauce, my friend got the grilled salmon. Both were delicious, perfect portions. We got our food really quickly, practically no wait time."
ChIJyQ-zmIEoQg0RExML5hShXGg,1,"Abismal! One of the worst food experiences I‚Äôve had in my life! Servers completely forgot me and my group were there. They took plates without even asking if we were done with them and they forgot to place the orden for a person in my group! On top of this, the waiter offered us complementary bread for the delay but once we got the ticket they charged us for it! Absolutely abismal, and this isn‚Äôt even the worse thing. I ate this plate (which looked good on the surface) but am currently suffering with severe food poison. And all of this for the modest price of 80 euros?!? Give me a break. Avoid."
ChIJyQ-zmIEoQg0RExML5hShXGg,5,We really enjoyed this restaurant. Our food was great and we really liked the complimentary olives to start. We had the salmon with lime hollandaise and organic chicken with vegetables and both dishes were delicious. Our waiter was very nice and provided us with great service.
ChIJyQ-zmIEoQg0RExML5hShXGg,1,Food was edible but nothing more. The place is called la taperia but the tapas selection was not large. But the worst part was that they brought us complimentary olives but the serving contained the pips of eaten olives. Find somewhere else.
ChIJVbnR9IAoQg0Rf04W97LJyhU,5,"Food was delicious with amazing prices. We got 5 plates of tapas (which were huge, not the usual small tapas size) for 4 people and paid 15‚Ç¨ each.

Service was quite fast too!"
ChIJVbnR9IAoQg0Rf04W97LJyhU,5,"This place was recommended by my hotel. Great food and the price was inexpensive! I had their menu of the day and it was amazing! I was served with first course, second course, a bottle of soda and homemade cheesecake! All for 20‚Ç¨."
ChIJVbnR9IAoQg0Rf04W97LJyhU,4,"Fatigas del Querer offers a vibrant atmosphere with traditional Spanish vibes, but my experience was mixed. The tomato soup was quite unusual, with a tangy taste that felt more like it was made from sour tomatoes rather than fresh ones, which wasn‚Äôt to my liking. On the bright side, the jam√≥n was excellent ‚Äì rich in flavor and perfectly prepared. The staff was friendly, and the ambiance was enjoyable, but the food quality varied. Worth a visit, but choose your dishes wisely."
ChIJVbnR9IAoQg0Rf04W97LJyhU,5,"Having lunch here was one of my favorite parts of my trip to Spain. Their lunch special was a super generous amount of food for the price. It also included a dessert and a drink.

The waiter was very helpful, he explained the menu to us and answered all our questions. They also cooked my steak more when I asked them to.

The dishes were all great as well. Again one of the best meals I had in Spain"
ChIJVbnR9IAoQg0Rf04W97LJyhU,5,"Their menu del d√≠a is the best bang for your buck. It‚Äôs 20 euro but the food and servings are generous.
Appetizers are free - 5 flavourful chorizos
1st plate is arroz caldoso con bogavante
2nd plate is the biggest codillo, good for 2 hungry people

My friend had 6 big prawns a la plancha and a whole grilled fish

If you‚Äôre hungry and want to do a menu del d√≠a, this by far is one of the best. Worth the higher than usual price."
ChIJMe9bPIIoQg0R9e5mfgd1bzk,5,Authentic cosy family vibe restaurant. Highly recommended
ChIJMe9bPIIoQg0R9e5mfgd1bzk,5,"Amazing food! We came and tried their filled olives, bread, escargot (really great), cheese plate, jamon ib√©rico (also amazing), and the calcots. The calcots were so fun- tip is to ask the server how to eat it! We were the only table on a Thursday night and had a great time. Highly recommend !"
ChIJMe9bPIIoQg0R9e5mfgd1bzk,3,"We took the 37‚Ç¨ menu and was not satisfactory. Very simple starters, meat was not tasty. The best was the dessert. Maybe the menu a la carte is better."
ChIJMe9bPIIoQg0R9e5mfgd1bzk,3,Speciality here is sausages which I'm not that keen on and which may reflect in my score . Comfortable enough eatery be ut nothing exciting
ChIJMe9bPIIoQg0R9e5mfgd1bzk,4,"According to Catalan people, it's not typically Catalan food but it's tasty and cozy. The asado de tira is my favorite and dried longsniza is great too."
ChIJgRES_IEoQg0RVrLIxnqAW8M,5,"If you are looking for healthy dishes with very friendly service, this place is the exactly right place to come!
White chocolate cake and dark chocolate orange cake are great to end up a meal!"
ChIJgRES_IEoQg0RVrLIxnqAW8M,5,"This place was amazing! Gracious and helpful staff, clean atmosphere, and a wonderful blend of flavors and textures. The food is light and flavorful, and the menu of the day is the best deal in town. Exactly what we were looking for, and supposedly the oldest eatery in Madrid established in 1979."
ChIJgRES_IEoQg0RVrLIxnqAW8M,5,"Tasty Vegan/Vegetarian food,. Fresh, natural ingredients and variety of flavours, served with love. Lovely, understated place, at a fair price. Three of us went and we really enjoyed our meal and experience."
ChIJgRES_IEoQg0RVrLIxnqAW8M,4,"I was really impressed with how helpful and attentive the staff was. I don‚Äôt speak much Spanish and have allergies so was excited to have someone explain what was safe for me and show total awareness of the contents of their food. There is a daily changing menu with a variety of tastes per option. We got the combo option so got to try some of everything and each dish was uniquely flavored. The white beans tasted like they had ham in them - which was impressive to me for vegan food! Food was more salty than I‚Äôd go for normally. Lots of options for dessert! I was so happy to have a yummy, filling, and safe meal."
ChIJgRES_IEoQg0RVrLIxnqAW8M,5,"Very nice place . Jesus and Babe received us as a family member. I ate there every single day of my stay which was more than 10 meals. Always good . The change the menu everyday . Salad or soup , bread and main meal then desert and tea or Malta to end . üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª"
ChIJYVaoZ4IoQg0RoQGleuWpcpo,5,The pour on the Mahou made it the best beer I may have ever had. Shrimp in garlic oil was great highly highly recommend getting both
ChIJYVaoZ4IoQg0RoQGleuWpcpo,4,"Right up the road from the Prado. We chose a rueda of toasts with roquefort/anchovy, salmon cochtel, shrimp, and pork loin.  Food was good; Servers were friendly. Go enjoy"
ChIJYVaoZ4IoQg0RoQGleuWpcpo,5,"Very good food at reasonable price with a great small Tavern atmosphere
Sangria big glass ‚Ç¨5üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ"
ChIJYVaoZ4IoQg0RoQGleuWpcpo,5,Best tapas after a long day walking around Madrid. Friendly staff and quick service.
ChIJYVaoZ4IoQg0RoQGleuWpcpo,5,"Amazing restaurant in the heart of Madrid. Friendly staff with English speaking staff too. Had a few dishes and all scrumptious üòã. If you visit here, you should definitely try the homemade Sangria. I have uploaded a video as well on how it is made."
ChIJIZ0TNIAoQg0R8D16E1onruQ,5,"This little restaurant is an absolute gem. The place is small so get a reservation or take your chances. It's crowded for a reason.

We each had the fixed menu at 15 Euros per person. It included a starter, a first dish, an entree, and a dessert. Everything, from the service to the presentation of the plates to the flavors, were simply divine. I started with the blended pea soup, had the wings, then the entree was the squid over pureed eggplant.

After a week in Madrid, this was, by far, the best food we had, and we ate out every meal.

Do yourself a favor and make a reservation."
ChIJIZ0TNIAoQg0R8D16E1onruQ,4,"Great fixed-price menu during lunchtime. I would recommend booking a table before the visit since it gets crowded. Service was correct, the portions were quite generous, and the food was delicious.

For dessert, go with the greek yogurt with granola‚Äîit is amazing!"
ChIJIZ0TNIAoQg0R8D16E1onruQ,5,"A cute small place to have dinner in Madrid! We ordered the set menu for two (‚Ç¨24 pp), which included 2 cold dishes, 3 hot and dessert. The food was very creative and tasty! The staff was very friendly and even the chef was suggesting how to eat everything in order to taste the dishes to the maximum. Very impressed! Highly recommend it ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJIZ0TNIAoQg0R8D16E1onruQ,4,"Service was great . I didn‚Äôt like something and they had no problem in changing it for something else . Loved the tacos , chicken wings and best torrija I ever had . They have a great lunch deal."
ChIJIZ0TNIAoQg0R8D16E1onruQ,5,"One of the best restaurants we went in Spain. Super cozy, good service, amazing food. Everything from the entries to the deserts were fantastic."
ChIJHQvNcYIoQg0RRKaB5N8WnvQ,4,"My husband and I ordered a few things from the standard menu and a few of the up-priced items. We started with scallops and pumpkin soup, excellent. Rarely have I had pumpkin soup that tastes like pumpkin and this definitely did, in the best way. My husband enjoyed  the scallops and their presentation in the shell. We both enjoyed our main course, goat for me, octopus for my husband. Our desserts were OK though the least satisfying part of the meal. Next time we will order the house wine without paying for the 2‚Ç¨ extra and not add the vegetable plate. We do plan a next time!

The staff were helpful with our many questions and our limited Spanish language.
I was pleasantly amused by the chandelier!"
ChIJHQvNcYIoQg0RRKaB5N8WnvQ,5,"Amazingly good!! We didn‚Äôt know it was prix fixe menu but it was a lovely dinning experience regardless. With around ‚Ç¨17-20 depending on what you choose you get a drink, two courses and a dessert. And there‚Äôs a good variety to choose from. The ingredients are so fresh, the portion is astonishing, and everything is very delicious."
ChIJHQvNcYIoQg0RRKaB5N8WnvQ,5,This was a great place for lunch after a visit to the Prado. It‚Äôs reasonably priced (photo of menu taken in mid-March 2025). I had the Russian salad and grilled sea bass - both of which were super delicious. The tiramisu was sadly ordinary.
ChIJHQvNcYIoQg0RRKaB5N8WnvQ,5,"Delicious food and pretty diverse menu del d√≠a. Also note that it is a rare place that offers a menu del d√≠a on the weekend. You must make reservations because it fills fast. Also note the servers keep you on task, so this might seem rude but it‚Äôs just their way to keep everything running on time and smoothly. If you want a place you can go and linger for hours and hours, this is not the place. If you want delicious food at a great price and so close to museums etc, this is your place."
ChIJHQvNcYIoQg0RRKaB5N8WnvQ,5,"This restaurant serves good food and you get value for the money that you pay for. We left full and we didn‚Äôt even finish all of the food. Each of us only paid for 30‚Ç¨. I ordered these:
-Salmorejo
-Solomillo pibil
-Arroz con leche
and we also got a pulpo a la gallega to share.

They even gave us bread with butter that‚Äôs delicious. It‚Äôs just butter but it‚Äôs delicious butter.

The staff was also very nice and friendly."
ChIJ-1QWz34oQg0RPRKVe8dI31k,5,"It is a quite pricey place as a breakfast can cost you 7 Euro or more. But it is located near Plaza Mayor and opens early.

The croissant is okay. Coffee is above average.

The best thing I like about this restaurant is that the manager is a very friendly person who will talk with you proactively and share with you about his thoughts. The strategy seems to work and has attracted a few old customers who feel very at home here.

If you have an extra penny and like to socialize, it's definitely worth a try."
ChIJ-1QWz34oQg0RPRKVe8dI31k,2,"Bland and Over priced meal. Service is slow but the waiters are nice. There is no vibe,the place is small"
ChIJ-1QWz34oQg0RPRKVe8dI31k,5,"It was a nice Italian restaurant, we had authentic pasta and tiramisu."
ChIJ-1QWz34oQg0RPRKVe8dI31k,1,"Ordered Americana breakfast. Potatoes were cold, beans were not what were pictured. ""Forgot"" bacon and pancakes. Should have come with chorizo, but came with hot dogs. For ‚Ç¨15 euro, what a joke. Furious"
ChIJ-1QWz34oQg0RPRKVe8dI31k,4,Really big portions. Recommended to dine after a day-long walk in the city. Pizzas are big Italian-sized and could be ordered perfectly for couples. Prices are very affordable.
ChIJp82wcpwoQg0RzIeUDrLpwhI,5,"A great option to stay in Madrid!
This hotel is unique not only for its welcoming environment but also for an amazing group of professionals that know very well how to make you feel like home.
The front desk team is amazingly always willing to help and to support you in any request you may have.
The team at the restaurant are the best part of this hotel, as you can feel how they really care for you to have a great breakfast experience. This is the place to be!"
ChIJp82wcpwoQg0RzIeUDrLpwhI,3,"The hotel is well placed for visiting the art museums, the park and the Botanical Gardens. It is on a busy street, but the noise level is very low due to good double glazing. The breakfast choice and quality is superb, plus plenty of tables. All of the staff we met were very cheerful, helpful and polite, and dealt with our complaint quickly. However we were a bit disappointed by the room. My bedside reading lamp was clearly broken, it was a modern LED swan neck affair, but it‚Äôs neck was broken and flopped all over the place, and for a long time looking at the marks on the bed head. There was a huge old fashioned telephone on a small shelf next to the bed which left no room for anything else. The fridge was incorporated into the wardrobe without ventilation, therefore the wardrobe was very hot inside a suitable for storing heat sensitive articles. The bathroom looked modern, but lacked function. The black shallow sink always looked stained even though clean. The tap, at the side was too far away and only just put water in the sink and not the floor. It was very difficult to rinse hands or toothbrush without splashing water everywhere except the sink. The plug only worked after many attempts to keep it down. We would have liked a bidet, and there was room for one. The shower spilled water over the bathroom floor, drenching the small bathmat.
Looking at some the photographs of the other rooms we felt we were a little bit short changed."
ChIJp82wcpwoQg0RzIeUDrLpwhI,5,"The hotel is clean, very well located, and good value.  The staff is friendly and attentive... special shout out to Lautaro who helped recommend and reserve restaurants and call taxis."
ChIJp82wcpwoQg0RzIeUDrLpwhI,5,"Modern rooms, clean, and great location.  My room had a small enclosed balcony. Great price in a more expensive area . Room had a hair dryer, fridge, and kettle for tea, coffee. Right across from the park."
ChIJp82wcpwoQg0RzIeUDrLpwhI,5,"We had a two night stay and the service was wonderful, Fernando was very friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating to our requests. If you're visiting Madrid you would find it difficult to book a better stay than at this hotel."
ChIJrY52EigmQg0RVxyJhQxX9t0,4,Great food and well worth the money for fast food. They don‚Äôt make Burger King like this in Canada or America anymore. The place was clean and staff were nice despite it being very busy.
ChIJrY52EigmQg0RVxyJhQxX9t0,1,"I had to wait 30 minutes to pay, the lady at the desk was on her phone and kept telling me she would take me later- she didn‚Äôt and I left after 45 minutes. My friend had ordered and paid an ice cream and didn‚Äôt get it because ¬´¬†the ice cream machine was broken¬†¬ª. When she asked for a refund, they told her they wouldn‚Äôt give her the money and gave her a small yogurt from the kids menu. Every one of my friend who went had to wait longer than 20 minutes. Do not recommend."
ChIJrY52EigmQg0RVxyJhQxX9t0,5,"I had an amazing experience at burger king, Madrid. The service was incredible and the staff went out of their way to help me with my order, since being a vegetarian has its cons being in Europe! :)"
ChIJrY52EigmQg0RVxyJhQxX9t0,4,"I was craving for a Burger King burger, and this location didn‚Äôt disappoint!"
ChIJrY52EigmQg0RVxyJhQxX9t0,1,"Worst service. When I pay at the front desk, the waiter doesn't look at me even once. Ordered eat-in with food delivery to the table which ended up in my order in takeout packaging on the front desk, ignored.
Food is just so so as I had imagined. But the bad service really pissed me off."
ChIJrSMK3IIoQg0Rav9ooGbsHMY,5,"Great Starbucks as always! Staff speaks very good English, too."
ChIJrSMK3IIoQg0Rav9ooGbsHMY,5,"‚Ä¢	Great location
‚Ä¢	Very friendly staff
‚Ä¢	Plenty of seating
‚Ä¢	Reasonable prices"
ChIJrSMK3IIoQg0Rav9ooGbsHMY,1,"It's -2 degrees, the main door is fully open. I came to have a hot coffee, did not enjoy"
ChIJrSMK3IIoQg0Rav9ooGbsHMY,1,"I order pistachio cream latte which is seasonal menu, as a tall size. it price will be 4.9 euros but they paid me 5.10 euros. I asked why and one of the staff answered me because it is seasonal menu so they use special coffee been automatically so It included 0.20 additional fee. This is so stupid!! If is it true, staff will be explain me before I paid. And I bought same menu 2 days ago and the asked me right price only which was 4.90 euros. It was so awful. I hope this kind of thing must be changed."
ChIJrSMK3IIoQg0Rav9ooGbsHMY,3,"A beautiful building to rest in. And a very affordable way to take a break in an area lacking affordable options.  Drinks are not so great. I think this is a business that has better products in the States.
Bathroom was out of service."
ChIJ6WD00SkmQg0Rl3gRjChd5Zw,5,"We stumbled upon this place as it started to rain and quite enjoyed it in the end. The place brings French vibes, with funky music and an interesting menu. We ordered tamales, smoked sardines and pickled quail breast. The dishes were tasty and flavorful. Good wines, good music, good atmosphere, you can easily spend several hours here."
ChIJ6WD00SkmQg0Rl3gRjChd5Zw,4,"Great pub that focuses on microbrews.  Over a dozen on tap!

Enjoyed this micro beer pub.  Lots of great choices, and was very pleased that they had samplers where you choose your own four tastings.  That is a great way to experience a lot of different beers, without overindulging.

Liked the modern beers in a classic pub environment, if you enjoy craft beers this is a must-stop."
ChIJ6WD00SkmQg0Rl3gRjChd5Zw,5,"Stumbled upon this place on a rainy Monday evening. Quirky, well stocked with an eclectic choice of music and very friendly service. What a great little bar. Will definitely visit again on a return trip to Madrid.üëçüèºüëçüèº"
ChIJ6WD00SkmQg0Rl3gRjChd5Zw,5,"We LOVED it here, so much that in our couple of days here in Madrid, we came twice. The bartenders remembered us and even remembered the exact beers we had the day before. The place has a nice homey feel, the food is great. We got the tamales (one of each) and they were great. There were many different beers on tap from across Europe. They even had a beer from our hometown, Seattle!! I was so shocked to see this. I‚Äôd highly recommend this place and if it‚Äôs not too busy, strike up a good conversation with the people working there. They like the things that are different and special in life."
ChIJ6WD00SkmQg0Rl3gRjChd5Zw,5,"The selection of beers is like a bible, it‚Äôs beautiful and they offer various styles. Not only do they offer exotic beer but they also offer exotic food such as the Oaxaca style tamale. If your looking to explore something unique, this is the spot!"
ChIJz0fhKCQmQg0R5vK66nH38Zw,3,Good food but a little bit too expensive. Nice service and quiet room.
ChIJz0fhKCQmQg0R5vK66nH38Zw,1,"What can I say about this place... The waiters are disgusting people, unwilling to work and quite rude. I went there because it was close to the station and to have a coke and a beer for ‚Ç¨6.75. At ‚Ç¨3.25 for a CAN of Coca Cola and ‚Ç¨3.50 for a CANE on tap. The stupid look on our faces was impressive. A real scam with the prices.

Terrible customer service, three waiters who took a quarter of an hour to serve us the soft drinks at a golden price and not a single sad tapa. Their education is inversely proportional to their prices. What I don't understand is how the site is still open. I sincerely hope it doesn't last too long."
ChIJz0fhKCQmQg0R5vK66nH38Zw,2,"From the look of this restaurant I wasn't expecting much.

It is a place with old decoration and somewhat peeling paint. The staff is not very friendly... it seems like they have a hard time talking to you... and the price of the drinks is quite high.

However, they are filled with food. Many starters, appetizers and the lamb shoulder make it very delicious.

I wouldn't go back, but my experience was through a coupon that I bought online, so with the discount and taking into account that I left there with a full stomach, the rest didn't bother me much."
ChIJz0fhKCQmQg0R5vK66nH38Zw,3,They pour the beer very well and serve it cold with your tapa (in our case some good torreznos and some croquettes).  The daily menu is very normal and simple for ‚Ç¨12. If it is true that in the area... You cannot ask for something cheap.
ChIJz0fhKCQmQg0R5vK66nH38Zw,2,"I found out about the site thanks to an offer on those coupon pages. The restaurant is well located, next to one of the exits of the Atocha metro station. So first of all, let's say that the place does not impress with its beauty, it has that old air, almost as if it had not been renovated in the last twenty-five years, some could define it almost as ""caste"". It doesn't help much that it isn't as clean as it should be, nor that the paint on the walls is completely cracked.

It was entering there and the waiter receiving an instant attack of extreme laziness, it took him almost ten minutes to place us at a dining room table... which by the way was empty. The living room had windows, but they were completely closed by blackout curtains, so the light there was was not natural, and the experience was not the most pleasant one could hope for.

The food, contrary to what the place led one to believe, was quite good, everything was on point, tasty and well cooked. I was pleasantly surprised that leaving them, they brought a couple of appetizers that were not included in the deal.

The final cherry on top was the absurd and exorbitant price of the drinks, ‚Ç¨3.5 for a small 200ml Cocacola and almost ‚Ç¨4 for a 1.5L bottle of water. I don't know where they went for them but they must have taken at least three planes to set that price.

In the end the cons outweighed the pros, a shame, because with that cuisine and a little care they could make that place a pleasant place."
ChIJwX94zoMoQg0Rb-eqc-uGllI,5,"Excellent food, beautiful restaurant and incredible service. Christmas dinner was outstanding! Recommend 100%"
ChIJwX94zoMoQg0Rb-eqc-uGllI,2,"Visited the restaurant for afternoon tea, service is very very slow before someone brings over the menu! Then took another 39 minutes for afternoon tea to arrive.

I personally disappointed since this is a Westin hotel restaurant!

The afternoon tea pastry is not up to expectation for Westin Hotel , there are 3 sandwich , cheese, Salmon and Spanish ham , some restaurants offer a bid of celery, these sandwich are way too plain.

Do not enjoy the pastry , nothing visually attractive.

After all, I asked for the wifi password, they gave me the wrong password then disappeared completely after couple of attempts to give the correct login password.

The restaurant is not busy , only 3 tables therefore I cannot understand the reason behind the poor service."
ChIJwX94zoMoQg0Rb-eqc-uGllI,5,"An escape to fancy with luxurious atmosphere, impeccable service, delicate flavors, and perfect drinks. Fine entrees and selection. Stunning scallops. Relaxing. Gorgeous details. Worth the splurge. Memorable meal."
ChIJwX94zoMoQg0Rb-eqc-uGllI,4,"The food was either too salty or too bland. However, the millefeuille was the best I've ever had. The egg custard was okay. The beautiful decor and piano playing kind of made up for some of the food though. It gets an extra star for ambiance. (I am vegetarian so my options were limited)"
ChIJwX94zoMoQg0Rb-eqc-uGllI,5,"A true fine dining experience! The food was spectacular and the chef is very talented! My fave was the Caesar salad even tho it‚Äôs a common dish :pp I found the one here really good :)))

The glass dome is also so so beautiful ü•π I felt like I was dining in a palace hall üòÅ and the staff were so kind, accommodating, and friendly :>

If you want a dining experience on the posh side, this place is definitely worth your money :D    I would recommend this place to my fellow tourists in Madrid ü§ì"
ChIJrV93tSkmQg0RXI9ZwkWEyhs,5,"This is my third visit, and I would like to say its a restaurant that ‚ÄúI need to go‚Äù everytime I‚Äôm in Madrid.

This restaurant never disappoints you and always have pleasant surprise on the way they present the food.

Please do the reservations before you go to the restaurant because you‚Äôll not going to get a place if you just show up.

The food taste just from the other world, completely Spanish authentic food with a touch of elegant..

Pairing it with wine, I guarantee you‚Äôll taste a little heaven in the world!üî•üòá"
ChIJrV93tSkmQg0RXI9ZwkWEyhs,5,"I reserved this hotel based on a reddit recommendation, and I was NOT disappointed!

To be honest I was a little confused when I found the place with such high praise to be very small and unassuming. When we entered I was even more confused as we were the only people, but when we sat and the food started to come I knew why it had such raving reviews!

Squid: very good. Well cooked and not chewy. The hummus was excellent and full of garlic flavour. Really nice!
Octopus: Some of the best octopus in Madrid cooking-wise. Perfectly-cooked! The guacamole was really good, but the mashed potatoes were okay.
Cod: the star of the show, and the main reason I wrote this review. The potatoes with it are the best I have ever eaten probably. The cod itself was creamy and light. Amazing plate!

Thank you, la Malontina, for such a great experience!"
ChIJrV93tSkmQg0RXI9ZwkWEyhs,5,"Delicious, cute and more delicious.
Walked in off the street and we were wowed. I could've eaten 10 layers of that creamy sauce on the lasagna.
The pork belly and croquettes (melt in your mouth lobster center) were phenomenal, but to be shared!
The only dish that could've used a little something was the leeks. Good but maybe a little char would've given another texture to the dish.
Otherwise 10/10."
ChIJrV93tSkmQg0RXI9ZwkWEyhs,5,"We came here for lunch after visiting the Prado because we couldn‚Äôt get a table for dinner the night before. We were so happy we came back. We spent two weeks traveling and eating in Spain and this stands out as one of our best meals (and that includes three Michelin restaurants - two BGs and one 2*). It‚Äôs a beautiful restaurant, we had great service, and enjoyed everything we tried."
ChIJrV93tSkmQg0RXI9ZwkWEyhs,5,"Very good service, very impressive. I ordered braised pork and a glass of red wine which were tasty. They gave me a kind of pepper which were grilled for appetizer, really good. I would love to try other dishes but too full."
ChIJ3cMdrikmQg0Rl5Yua_eReoE,5,Their paella is delicious! With one portion you can feed at least three people. The waiter is patient and lovely. Even with the language barrier we were able to figure out the order.
ChIJ3cMdrikmQg0Rl5Yua_eReoE,4,"Friendly staff, good food, fun atmosphere. Great place to watch the game. Paella was enormous- 2 servings could easily feed 5 people. Everyone, including regular customers, were welcoming."
ChIJ3cMdrikmQg0Rl5Yua_eReoE,5,Our favorite place in Madrid.   We went there for every meal.  I will miss it so much when we go home.   Very nice people   Very inexpensive.  Delicious
ChIJ3cMdrikmQg0Rl5Yua_eReoE,5,"Can‚Äôt put a 4.5 (unfortunately) so I‚Äôll put a 5
Really good typical Spanish bar. Had some calamares that were fresh 5‚Äô before my plate, 1 tortilla and a glass of (good) Albari√±o for 8.5‚Ç¨.
The bartender is really friendly and looks like the people coming there are regulars. They even offered free pieces of fried chicken that were also good üôåüèæ"
ChIJ3cMdrikmQg0Rl5Yua_eReoE,5,"Such a great spot that we stumbled onto by chance - portions are huge (we were advised by the staff member to get three tapas dishes between us instead of five, and he was right!) and food was delicious. We had three dishes between us, three glasses of wine and three beers and it came to just under ‚Ç¨40 - excellent value and amazing quality."
ChIJbzIh_SkmQg0RdmTIzdzsDLg,5,Beautiful restaurant with excellent variety of cuisine. Every bite is a fountain of flavours. My favourite dish is the ceviche - zestful and fresh which made me craving more. The staff is attentive to the presentation of every dish. It looks too wonderful to consume. Definitely recommend everyone to partake in this wonderful dining experience in the heart of Madrid.
ChIJbzIh_SkmQg0RdmTIzdzsDLg,5,Food was truly revolutionary. Service was amongst the best I have ever received. Gabriel and staff outperformed all night. A Michelin experience all around!!
ChIJbzIh_SkmQg0RdmTIzdzsDLg,5,The experience is highly worth it! I had the best dishes in Madrid so far. Sergio's attention and kindness took it to a whole new level. Strongly recommend!
ChIJbzIh_SkmQg0RdmTIzdzsDLg,5,"If you wanna visit this restaurant and you're a single traveler like me. Go for the tasting menu. So you can experience the staffs knowledge of wine and food to the fullest.

Thanks for having me!"
ChIJbzIh_SkmQg0RdmTIzdzsDLg,5,"This is our fourth time here, and it‚Äôs an absolute must every time we‚Äôre in Madrid. The seasonal menu, crafted by a fantastic chef, never fails to impress. Each dish is a journey of flavors, from the first bite to the last. Plus, they have a great selection of wines to perfectly complement your meal. I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough‚Äîreservations are a must!"
ChIJ3Rd5gigmQg0RzkCQl0gnAO8,5,"Definitely recommend it.
Quality and price worth it.
For daily menu, you paid 14‚Ç¨."
ChIJ3Rd5gigmQg0RzkCQl0gnAO8,5,A local told us that the paella at the second floor was very good. And it was true. A lot of flavors and a lot of seafood. We couldn't finish two portions with 5 people. We are very happy about our experience.
ChIJ3Rd5gigmQg0RzkCQl0gnAO8,5,"Two beers one big plate of Jamon and a small generous plate of Chorizo for 6‚Ç¨. What more can you ask for?! Simple place, great atmosphere, no frills. Highly recommended."
ChIJ3Rd5gigmQg0RzkCQl0gnAO8,5,"Love this place.  I go there every morning for breakfast.  The food is very good.  If you like jamon, you will be in heaven.   You can buy some to take with you."
ChIJ3Rd5gigmQg0RzkCQl0gnAO8,5,"Wonderful food, the relationship between price and quality is perfect. I strongly recommend this place. The waitress was beautiful and kind."
ChIJwX94zoMoQg0RLmOM_sZHcy8,5,"Had a fantastic lunch at Asia Gallery inside the Westin Palace Hotel. We enjoyed Crispy Fried Prawn Rolls, Duck Dumpling w/Boletus & Foie Gras, Dim Sum Platter, 1/2 Pekin Duck (made 12 rolls), and Cheesecake for dessert. Everything was exceptional, the food made fresh, the service was extremely polite & professional. Will definitely return! This restaurant is normally more on the pricey side, but they had a promotion through El Tenedor (The Fork) for 50% off, so in the end, very reasonable. Special shout out to the Yow, the Manager, who was extremely professional & friendly and made our dining experience an absolute delight! Give him a raise!"
ChIJwX94zoMoQg0RLmOM_sZHcy8,4,"üçΩ Food: 4/5
ü§µüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èService: 3/5
ü™ëAmbiance: 4/5

üìùNotes: The food is good, probably the best Chinese in Madrid. I just wasn‚Äôt wowed by the food at the end of the day, but it was good. The service was a bit slow, especially when it came to ordering the check :( I wouldn‚Äôt mind coming again and maybe tryin other things for a change, but its hard for me to recommend the place when it felt a bit out of place"
ChIJwX94zoMoQg0RLmOM_sZHcy8,2,"It‚Äôs not often that I‚Äôll leave a restaurant with suggestions of what not to order, but this is one of them. This is way over-priced for what they offer. Don‚Äôt order the ‚Äòsolomillo caramelizado‚Äô or the ‚Äòpollo estilo Asian Gallery‚Äô. They both will leave you cold and with a bad taste in your mouth a literally. Unfortunately, I‚Äôll give this one a skip in future."
ChIJwX94zoMoQg0RLmOM_sZHcy8,2,"The interior is beautiful, but way too dark and cramped.

We ordered a lot of things out of which we only liked the pad thai. Which still had ingredients that do not belong in pad thai and didn‚Äôt contribute to the taste in a good way. The duck came with sheets of bread and onion, which we could have gratefully skipped.

Sometimes trying to be fancy and to do a lot is the wrong way to go. In this case, we felt that the restaurant was overrated and way too expensive for the food served.

It was good to go and see what it was, but we would not be coming back.

The interior of the hotel was quite nice, the lobby especially."
ChIJwX94zoMoQg0RLmOM_sZHcy8,4,Did not expect to find such a good (and spicy) Chinese restaurant in a Hotel. Even a high quality hotel like this one. Beautiful place and great service. Definitely recommend.
ChIJfUu6XIIoQg0Rb79ey-fvRy4,4,"This is a great little taverna that is away from the crowded tourist streets and restaurants of Madrid.

Be prepared to order in Spanish (which just means reading the menu and pointing when in doubt), as the waitress didn‚Äôt speak much English. This is also a plus in my book, since the place was more patronized by locals.

We had the house salad (Ensalate de Casa) which looks s bit daunting, but is delicious. Just be sure to pair the salty bits, like the anchovies and olives, with the tuna and tomatoes. We were honestly surprised by how well the flavors (tuna belly, tomato, anchovies, green olives, and olive oil) went together.

The chorizo is a must. In many places chorizo can get really salty, but this one was not. Very fresh, juicy, and the perfect amount of heat. Like the salad, the fries that came with the chorizo weren‚Äôt salty and added even more balance to the dish.

We also tried the tripe. It was not at all what we feared. No weird odor or ‚Äúfunk‚Äù to it. Super tender, but unfortunately, way too salty to enjoy even with bread.

We also"
ChIJfUu6XIIoQg0Rb79ey-fvRy4,5,"The food was amazing - well-cooked, tasty, juicy, and cost-effective. Our server was amicable enough to provide us with suggestions, which we deeply appreciated. Can't wait to be back!"
ChIJfUu6XIIoQg0Rb79ey-fvRy4,5,Fantastic atmosphere and food. Good prices and friendly staff.
ChIJfUu6XIIoQg0Rb79ey-fvRy4,5,"We somehow stumbled into this tapas bar and it impressed us so much. The owner was very efficient and friendly and everything we ordered was great! Especially pleased with the Galatian octopus as it was flavourful and fantastically tender! The iberico cheek was a rare sight on the menu and was a delight to eat with the potato, Demi glaze sauce and bread!"
ChIJfUu6XIIoQg0Rb79ey-fvRy4,5,"Local tavern with amazing food and good service. The waitress didn't know any english, so she took out some pictures of the food and helped us understand the menu. We had the artichokes with ham and the steak with potatoes and both were out of this world. At the end they gave us two mini magnum icecream bites, which was really appreciated. Definitely recommend!"
ChIJ4fErpSgmQg0R4ARbhnDWBiE,5,"We ordered Bolognese pasta, 4 cheese pizza. Both dishes were very tasty. Paste is a large portion, the pizza has delicious cheese. Pizza on thin dough. The order was delivered quickly. The waiter is very friendly.For a sufficiently touristic place, the food is inexpensive and tasty. Each position cost us 13 euros. But drinks are quite expensive, about 3.5-4 euros. But in general, the check is not very expensive."
ChIJ4fErpSgmQg0R4ARbhnDWBiE,2,"Restaurant is directly opposite the museum. Service was fast, not overly friendly. We ordered pizza, pasta and salad. The chicken in the Cesar salad was cold, the dressing tasted very much like store bought dressing. Was ok. The Pizza was cold, tasteless, very small and reminded a lot of frozen Supermarkt pizza. Pasta was warm but nothing special. Like tomato sauce from a jar. Tables were clean though as well as the toilette.

But be aware that the bread, butter and chips are not free. They put it one the table without you ordering it and will charge you for it.

You won't leave hungry, but we had much better food in Madrid for the same price."
ChIJ4fErpSgmQg0R4ARbhnDWBiE,4,"We accidentally discovered this wonderful gem while walking around the area finding a place for dinner. Quirky theme of marrying da Vinci s work with Pinocchio. The staff doesn't speak any English and barely understands it, but the menu is helpful and they are able to figure out what we want quickly. We relished both our spaghetti dishes... In pesto and arabbiata sauces. The bread basket with sticks and freshly baked bread was heavenly. Go for the veggie soup only if you can stomach a thick, flavourful broth. The brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce was also a good reminder of sizzling brownies available across Bombay. We also ordered a Margherita pizza with mushroom toppings which was decent, but we've had better. I particularly liked the fact that it didn't have a very thick crust.
Also go for the sangria if you want a refreshing but sweetish beverage."
ChIJ4fErpSgmQg0R4ARbhnDWBiE,5,"I had the best carpaccio entrance ever! Witch is the biggest thing for Italian food amateur like me! The pasta al pesto was fresh and simply delicious and the service was excellent. Going back to eat there again before my end of holiday ü•∞ Thank you so much for the quick and efficient service, plus the quality of the food and beverage.  üëåüíéüíØ"
ChIJ4fErpSgmQg0R4ARbhnDWBiE,2,"The food was barely edible.

My pasta was not cooked completely.

We've been charged the bread that is served upon sitting."
ChIJP3LusoMoQg0RGuQ1bOtHDZ4,3,"Disappointing menu del dia, i went to my favourite place Edelweiss, when i saw an advertising poster and made a mistake deciding to try menu del d√≠a here. I ordered Noodles üçú langostinos üç§ y pollo, it was tasteless like grass with the cheapest pasta ever, wine üç∑ was awful and included desert was like the cheapest chemical option from the supermarket üòîüòûüòïüôÅ. wooden spoon, I hope they wash it. The toilet button is broken. I was absolutely disappointed after visiting this place. Only one plus: positive staff and administrator speaks Japanese."
ChIJP3LusoMoQg0RGuQ1bOtHDZ4,3,"Welcoming staff, food is good. The Shrimp sushi rolls could be better, the spring roll is average as well, overall good as to go. The food we selected I believe can get better recipe to get better taste & rich flavor."
ChIJP3LusoMoQg0RGuQ1bOtHDZ4,5,"Great Japanese food!! And I mean it from several points: We went on a Monday for lunch so it was not too crowded as many people claim. We ordered the 57.Pork Ribs Noodles with a drink and the strawberry cheesecake (included in the Noodles menu), the 75.Tempura prawns and the 80.Tonkatsu (deep fry pork). Everything was delicious plus the service was great and very friendly"
ChIJP3LusoMoQg0RGuQ1bOtHDZ4,5,"Fantastic food, great price. Not what you‚Äôd expect from buffet all you can eat, but the quality is really good and the ambience is fantastic! Really quick and friendly service too. No surprise that it gets busy every evening! Recommend any of the sushi / sashimi dishes. The hot food is ok, but not as great as the fish."
ChIJP3LusoMoQg0RGuQ1bOtHDZ4,5,"Excellent food, everything is delicious. The staff is also fantastic. When I mistakenly ordered a dish with something I'm mildly allergic to, they were very quick to confirm that was in it, and offered to have it remade without the allergen. I just switched dishes with my partner instead, because he liked mine better anyway. We will definitely be back."
ChIJk0v-84IoQg0RF9tVe8GYhnc,5,Good priced on fixed lunch menu. Very happy with food. Clean bathrooms. Plenty of space on table and space between tables. You are not squished in like some places. Enjoyed the food good flavor and portions for the price. Good location across the road from the Prado.
ChIJk0v-84IoQg0RF9tVe8GYhnc,2,"Rule #1 in Spain, never NEVER order nachos. I know that rule, but my son ignored it. Thus we were served the worst nachos ever eaten. Truly disgusting. The rest of the food was barely edible. The waiters argued about the table numbers everytime a dish came out of the kitchen."
ChIJk0v-84IoQg0RF9tVe8GYhnc,5,"Amazing place, food and people. Fernando served us so well, amazing experience!!"
ChIJk0v-84IoQg0RF9tVe8GYhnc,5,"Excellent service, great selection of wine and most importantly the food was delicious."
ChIJk0v-84IoQg0RF9tVe8GYhnc,5,We were so lucky to find this restaurant. The staff were super nice and the food traditional Spanish plates that were delicious!
ChIJS6RrDyomQg0RfuacppbbFlU,3,"We got there at 8:19pm on a march friday night and already there were about 10 people lined up.  Pretty much everyone that got there by 8:25pm or so got a table as they do have a rather large seating area.  You can preview the menu outside their front door while you wait.  Two of us had the fancier 32E 2 course meal, and another had the more simple 16E 3 course meal.  For apps we had the house made croquettes, battered eggplant, and cooked chard (actually tasty).  Comes with rather dry table bread.  For mains my T bone steak had a nice crust and had decent seasoning, but for a steak barely 1.5 cm thick, the insides were almost raw.  The quality of the steak was also quite poor.  Lamb chops were very thin (under 1cm) but tasted good and were cooked all the way thru.  My wife had the tripe dish served stew like but it was way overcooked and mushy (I like a bit of chew in my tripe).  The fries were hot but not quite crispy enough for my liking.  For dessert we had a cooked banana with whipped cream and chocolate.  Wine was the bottle shown in my photo, which tasted like a cheap red wine that I would use for cooking.  Overall a quick and hearty meal with large portions and affordable, but don't expect expertly prepared dishes to come to your table."
ChIJS6RrDyomQg0RfuacppbbFlU,4,"A place you can eat and enjoy Spanish food and drinks. The restaurant is not so big and was full at lunch time. You can choose from big variety of starters, main meals, desserts üç® and drinks üç∏, just for 17 euro per person. The service was good and fast."
ChIJS6RrDyomQg0RfuacppbbFlU,5,"We've been for lunch 5 times in a 2 week trip. Delicious, traditional, lively, friendly staff, efficient, great value.
In addition, what keeps us going back is a wide range of vegetable side dishes - it's often so hard to eat healthy while traveling.
¬°Muchos gracias, La Sanabresa!"
ChIJS6RrDyomQg0RfuacppbbFlU,5,A place that we chose on the run but which did not disappoint us. They have menu options through which you can create your perfect meal. The prices are also very affordable for the location they have. I recommend this place
ChIJS6RrDyomQg0RfuacppbbFlU,5,"A part of me didn't want to leave this review because I don't wish this place becomes touristy and lose it's charm. So if you're going just going quietly without sharing all over the Internet.

The restaurant has many 3-course-meal packages to select and each of them has many choices. The local food served were tasty. The waiter are very attentive, although they don't speak very good English, but they're very friendly.

My wife and I had a dinner with 36 euros, that's very cheap isn't it?! Too bad we didn't have second chance to come back and taste other menu during our trip."
ChIJuZPf4ikmQg0RamNqvGvOaCs,5,"If you‚Äôre in Madrid, Chocolat Madrid is an absolute must-visit! The food here is simply amazing ‚Äî fresh, flavorful, and perfectly prepared. I had the classic combination of fried egg, crispy potatoes, and jam√≥n, and it was absolutely delicious. The toast was perfectly crunchy, and everything was served with a warm and authentic touch.

The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, making the whole experience even better. You can really feel the welcoming vibe from the moment you step in.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a true taste of Madrid with great service!"
ChIJuZPf4ikmQg0RamNqvGvOaCs,5,"If you're looking for Chocolate & Churros in Madrid, this is the place. We visited for breakfast and / or lunch every day of our stay in Madrid. My family loved it, and I was in heaven. Everything on the menu is amazing, but the highlights for me were the chocolate and churros and orange juice. The breakfast food surprised me! It was so delicious as well. I dream about this place every night! Make sure to get the orange juice!!!! The owner was such a gentleman.. I appreciate the memories he helped me build!"
ChIJuZPf4ikmQg0RamNqvGvOaCs,4,"Chocolate Madrid is a great spot to enjoy Chocolate con and a variety of other chocolate flavors. The ambiance is pleasant, though fairly typical. It‚Äôs a nice place to sit, relax, and chat while indulging in rich, flavorful chocolate treats."
ChIJuZPf4ikmQg0RamNqvGvOaCs,5,"July 5th, 2024.

Best churros experience I have ever had.
I ordered churros, porras, chocolate and coffee.
Churros and Porras weren't sugary which is perfect, because the mild sweetness of the chocolate balances the flavour and makes it delicious.

Speaking of chocolate, I love how thick and dense it was compared to others, it sticks on the churros when you dip it. It's also a little bit darker and smokier than the others.

If I come back to Madrid, I'll definitely go there again."
ChIJuZPf4ikmQg0RamNqvGvOaCs,5,"Chocolat Madrid is highly recommended. The churros are delicious and airy, especially when paired with their thick hot chocolate. The chocolate cake is exceptional ‚Äì moist, rich, and perfectly sweet. Service is fast and efficient, and seating is plentiful."
ChIJWeHejismQg0RBICxZJYIUeU,5,"I went to Madrid the last week and I was in LA PLAYA drinking with friends. It was such a good time‚Ä¶ Diana, Rafa, Tito haha they were amazing. The best service‚Ä¶ üçª"
ChIJWeHejismQg0RBICxZJYIUeU,5,"Very very cool little bar that makes you feel like you're at the beach. Great specials on certain days of the week too. The food looked awesome, and they serve Vermuth and Alhambra (beer) on tap!"
ChIJWeHejismQg0RBICxZJYIUeU,5,Hip small bar with a full bar. Came in for a glass of wine and had a great time.
ChIJWeHejismQg0RBICxZJYIUeU,4,Vermouth was great. Atmosphere outside great. Friendly staff. Food was ok.
ChIJWeHejismQg0RBICxZJYIUeU,4,Cool little place I visited a few weeks ago with some friends. Very lively atmosphere and pleasant. Stayed several hours and it got a little crowded but not unbearably so. The nachos were very good and I would certainly have no problem with going back soon. Bartender was very good and efficient making getting a drink not too difficult even when packed full of patrons. Nice neighborhood vibe.
ChIJkSX-tYMoQg0RHosqp803P-g,4,"Loved the interior and the atmosphere of this restaurant. Food was delicious but mind you the portion is small.
(You need to check out a little museum collection on the way to the bathroom)"
ChIJkSX-tYMoQg0RHosqp803P-g,5,"One of my favourite restaurants in town! They serve the best traditional Spanish dishes, the tortillas and the beef tartar! ‚ú®"
ChIJkSX-tYMoQg0RHosqp803P-g,5,"We tried 7 dishes on the menu. They have new Tapas menu, price would be more reasonable than previous. Food was great! I recommend Octopus and Duck gratin. Shrimp ravioli was also good! Service was so friendly and lovely.
Thanks!"
ChIJkSX-tYMoQg0RHosqp803P-g,5,"Our experience in this restaurant was SO GOOD! The waitresses were very friendly and attentive, and the food simply DELICIOUS..we've both been dreaming about the ""virutas de foie"" the last days and everything we ordered we would definitely repeat next time!!"
ChIJkSX-tYMoQg0RHosqp803P-g,5,"Upscale restaurant.
Great dishes and good service.
Restaurant is a part of Villareal Hotel so if you go to this place you should see the the hotel as well, it's a masterpiece.
Don't expect a cheap place."
ChIJEWoWVYIoQg0RS4rabN17Y2U,5,"Casual place to grab coffee, snacks, beer. We had a lovely brunch while sitting in the sun."
ChIJEWoWVYIoQg0RS4rabN17Y2U,5,"Perfect place on Wednesdays and Sundays where you can get mini sandwiches for 1‚Ç¨. You have so many options to choose from and definitely will appreciate it as a different type of lunch/dinner. I would recommend getting like 4-6 sandwiches to actually feel full, but with that you're getting a handful of free chips. Good place!"
ChIJEWoWVYIoQg0RS4rabN17Y2U,4,"Plenty of these restaurants all over Madrid and they fill a gap when you are
Peckish, lots to chose from on the menu and
Lovely freezing cold pints of Tinto de verano to cool you down (for medicinal purposes of course)."
ChIJEWoWVYIoQg0RS4rabN17Y2U,5,"This is just near the Museum de Prado, in Madrid. Amazing outside seating with a usual atmosphere in all over Europe, this place will make you feel better with the food and the vibe. When you get down at Sol metro station and start your walking spree (a must do activity from this place which is called the gate of the sun), you‚Äôll find various restaurants like this. I fortunately tried this one, I really liked it."
ChIJEWoWVYIoQg0RS4rabN17Y2U,4,Easy place to have friends together with budget
ChIJnRHo64EoQg0RAlPsgcBO2XY,5,"My most favourite place in Madrid ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you love wine, cheese, fabulous and friendly service and a warm atmosphere this should be your very first restaurant/shop to visit. To add meat is served also but I didn't try it (I'm vegetarian).

I went to a different wine and cheese bar before this and received very unhelpful and unpleasant service so left (see my other review) BUT I am so glad I did. Casa Gonzalez is a gem I would wholeheartedly recommend.

The gentleman who served me made several recommendations for a Vermouth, wine and cheese which was helpful, but not pushed in any way.

I decided to have a Spanish cheese board, which comprised of 5 cheeses and a quince jam chutney with crackers and bread. They were all utterly delicious although I was a little sceptical about the goats cheese.

My total bill was 23 euro... which was for a Vermouth, 2 glasses of wine and the cheese as well as a dish of olives.

My only regret was finding Gonzalez on my last evening.

I'll be sure to return!

Enjoy ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJnRHo64EoQg0RAlPsgcBO2XY,5,"The best casa in Madrid. Real local food, excellent wines, absolutely perfect service. Don't hesitate to visit and enjoy delicatessen. If you have to wait for table, just wait - it's definitely worth. One of the rare places which I really want to visit again."
ChIJnRHo64EoQg0RAlPsgcBO2XY,5,"What a brilliant find! We came here hoping to have some cheese and wine, and stayed for much longer than we anticipated because the service, the food, the wine, the atmosphere, the decor was phenomenal. The server (the one with the Keith Haring tattoo) was amazing, attentive and full of zest! I also had a Spanish omelette with padron peppers and it was by far the best omelette I have had in Spain so far. Highly recommend stopping in here!"
ChIJnRHo64EoQg0RAlPsgcBO2XY,5,"How lucky we were to stumble upon this little gem. We had no idea of where we were or what we were going to find. Casa Gonzalez is a wonderful, quaint shop that sells Iberic ham and other specialties, cheeses, wines, Olive oils, etc. It looks much like a butcher or deli shop, but also features some tables where you can sit and enjoy a nice meal. The place is small, yet very popular with the locals especially. The service was wonderful and personable, the food very fresh and interesting, and the wine selection is very impressive, all for a very reasonable price. We had an Iberic charcuterie plate, a cheese plate, wines and a very enjoyable time. It was all delicious and perfect."
ChIJnRHo64EoQg0RAlPsgcBO2XY,5,Casa Gonz√°lez is a super Deli and wine store with a small area to have small plates made either their own deli products. It is an incredible experience for anybody wanted to try good Spanish wines with selected cheeses and cured meets like Spanish ham.
ChIJ30BYHyomQg0ROe5I71ixlGs,3,I honestly used to be a regular customer ordering to pick up and also ordering delivery but after many different errors in my orders I stopped almost in October. I decided to give it another shot again and I ordered off their own app and once again one of my orders was mistaken on top of that apparently they don't cut the pizza anymore on delivery which makes sense their reasoning saying that they don't know how the pizza will arrive if it's cut up previously but at least give us a warning. Or at least give us the choice to have it cut or not maybe some of us don't have the tools. I can imagine someone ordering from a hotel getting the pizza and not having any way to cut them. I love Domino's Pizza and it's amazing cheese filled crust but this service has really Fallen.
ChIJ30BYHyomQg0ROe5I71ixlGs,4,"Some  people talk really bad about this place!  Don‚Äôt know WHY!
It is a decent domino‚Äôs, very small yes (around 6 tables), usually crowded yes, and the staff is not always super happy to receive you YEAH but for being a Domino‚Äôs it‚Äôs very decent!
We usually ask for the (eat and drink ‚Äúbuffet‚Äù for 7,25‚Ç¨) and the fin√≠sima or ‚Äúslim or thin‚Äù pizza for us is the best option!
Be patient with the staff, understand that their busy, say hello and smile to them, be kind(like you should be everywhere) and they‚Äôll make their best effort to give you a good service!
We go there at least 3 times per month and never had a bad experience!"
ChIJ30BYHyomQg0ROe5I71ixlGs,5,"Must go and get the all you can eat! They‚Äôll ask you to wait for a table, which can take some time but it‚Äôs totally worth it!
The staff is very kind and helpful. üçï"
ChIJ30BYHyomQg0ROe5I71ixlGs,1,"Horrible experience, do not try to eat there. First they dont speak english and acnt comunicate with them.Second they have 7 seats in the restaurant. After we placed a order we were told to get outside.There was a table but after 3 mins another person came speaked with the cashier and then the cashier told us that the table is for that guy. The pizza taste like nothing and the service is terrible"
ChIJ30BYHyomQg0ROe5I71ixlGs,5,"Great place to eat & always good offers to go with a large group to eat the Buffet!
To consider only that the Buffet is valid for +2 people so it does not allow to take the beneffits of it when going alone.
Pizza Pecado Carnal & Cabramelizada, the best choices! üòâ"
ChIJWU-lKygmQg0RGcCKk6a4m6Y,5,"Los Rotos has a wonderful, warm, and cozy cafe vibe. I would‚Äôve loved to visit for dinner as well! We went early for breakfast and the food was amazing (huge portions of egg and ham, I could‚Äôve gotten away with sharing!) everyone was so kind there too, the next time we visit Spain, we‚Äôll make a stop here again"
ChIJWU-lKygmQg0RGcCKk6a4m6Y,5,Amazing place to eat here in Madrid. You have to get the huesos rotos. The skillet plate with Chistorra is absolutely amazing and a must. They have really good potatos and seafood as well. I think this is a nice lowkey place to try. Not super touristy either.
ChIJWU-lKygmQg0RGcCKk6a4m6Y,4,"Loved the decor, loved the neighbor, loved the serrano mollete but service is bad.

You‚Äôre most likely going to have to wait but the food is worth. The bread of the mollete is soft and tasty. Small portions so try at least 2. Service is bad and slow."
ChIJWU-lKygmQg0RGcCKk6a4m6Y,5,"We stumbled upon this gem while on our mission to find a local spot, and let me tell you, it was absolutely worth the hunt. The menu offered an impressive range of options, from pans and cold mollets to a variety of veal, pig, and seafood dishes, as well as some fantastic seasonal choices. After some contemplation, I went with the Duck and Foie under *Rotos De Luxe*, the Castilian soup from the seasonal section, and the Taquitos de Pincho Moruno from the ""Of The Pigs"" category.

The lean pork was so tender it practically melts in your mouth. The Duck and Foie were perfectly succulent, rich in flavor, and the Castilian soup had just the right balance of warmth and depth. It was the kind of meal that makes you forget about everything else going on around you.

The vibe of the place added an extra layer to the experience.Can't wait to go back!"
ChIJWU-lKygmQg0RGcCKk6a4m6Y,5,"The molletes (muffins) were very good and the portion was huge!! Great supper option - although they serve pretty much the same kinds of food in different forms (like muffin or pan). Ambience was great, cosy and authentic. There was a short line at 10pm on Friday but it cleared quickly (also a line at other times of the day actually). Staff were friendly and their service was prompt. Note that drinks menu were not included in their main menu, so you need to refer to somewhere else or ask the service staff. Overall - Recommended!"
ChIJfxQE-SgmQg0R2InCvpU3-pE,5,"Definitely the best crispy duck, crispy lemon chicken and Cantonese fried rice I have tried during my travels in Europe. The hot and spicy soup was also good. . Very friendly service and great atmosphere. The price is reasonable and the servings were generous. Highly recommended and definitely will return when we visit Madrid again in December 2024."
ChIJfxQE-SgmQg0R2InCvpU3-pE,5,Very nice and friendly restaurant. Food and service was great. Not easy to find a good Chinese restaurant in Spain.
ChIJfxQE-SgmQg0R2InCvpU3-pE,5,"We visited Spain for 10 days and my children missed Chinese food on day eight. So, we checked out this restaurant, the servers are kind . We order a plate of sushi, some dimsum and a mix stir fry vegetable.

This is not a dimsum or sushi place. I recommend the food in their authentic Chinese menu."
ChIJfxQE-SgmQg0R2InCvpU3-pE,5,"Great service and authentic!

Had tempura beef teriyaki and pickled fish. Very good!"
ChIJfxQE-SgmQg0R2InCvpU3-pE,5,Fantastic men√∫ del d√≠a options! The Indonesian fried rice was really tasty.
ChIJow5ZXCgmQg0RgZSiCPgkLRA,5,"We came here hoping to try the brunch, but unfortunately, by 12:00 there wasn‚Äôt much food left. So we just had a coffee, fresh orange juice, and the carrot cake with homemade cream, which was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is truly unique, as if you‚Äôre sitting inside someone‚Äôs cozy home, having tea in their living room. A charming spot for a quiet break, even if the brunch options run out early!"
ChIJow5ZXCgmQg0RgZSiCPgkLRA,5,This is a quaint and cozy cafe serving delicious home cooked meals. Staff were warm and friendly and very accommodating. Excellent value for money.
ChIJow5ZXCgmQg0RgZSiCPgkLRA,5,The place is small and cozy. Great lunch for two. Service was impeccable and the food was great. Desserts were delicious also. Would love to come back!
ChIJow5ZXCgmQg0RgZSiCPgkLRA,5,"Excellent breakfast and lunch spot.  Very reasonably priced and delicious Menu del Dia‚Äù. The owner speaks English very well (and I also heard him speak French), so he was able to help us out with menu choices."
ChIJow5ZXCgmQg0RgZSiCPgkLRA,5,"Amazing place in Madrid with the most delicious Spanish homemade food. We found this place by accident on our first day in Madrid and came back all days of our stay for lunch. Menu del dia is changing everyday, food is super tasty, atmosphere is very cosy and staff is super friendly and welcoming.
You can't miss this place if you're in Madrid!"
ChIJic1aHSYmQg0RvCHkY5r00XM,5,"Small shop but so much to offer! Yogurt so refreshing with different toppings. I tried also the watermelon juice ; topped with frozen yoghurt and dark chocolate sauce! The best! Special shout out to super friendly staff Maria who assisted me with my order, with language barrier I managed to order and also trusted her recommendation, she is amazing!"
ChIJic1aHSYmQg0RvCHkY5r00XM,5,Delicious frozen yoghurt that people can combine with many different toppings. My favorite mix is pistachio cream with white chocolate and mango.
ChIJic1aHSYmQg0RvCHkY5r00XM,4,"Tastyyy! Very good option for a snack or a dessert. The froyo itself tastes sweet, but not too artificial. You have different toppings: chocolate, nuts, fruit and sauces. The fruit tastes fresh and is available according to the season. I had a medium froyo with three toppings and an extra topping of sauce. If you want more than the recommended toppings for the size you choose, you pay ‚Ç¨0.60 extra for every topping."
ChIJic1aHSYmQg0RvCHkY5r00XM,5,"I have tried the SANUM yogurt (with mango, strawberries and kiwi) and I found the quality pretty high. Fruit was fresh and well cut, the yogurt was creamy, not too sweet with a nice mango topping. Fairly priced for that portion."
ChIJic1aHSYmQg0RvCHkY5r00XM,5,Amazing place. I love llaollao everywhere and this branch is awesome
ChIJy7v_pygmQg0R-yQ0eJBMJPw,4,"Decent spot for cheap food! Don‚Äôt expect anything fancy. But it‚Äôs a good spot for cheap food and beer. The sandwiches were decently good and the service was quick. There‚Äôs tons of sandwich options depending on what you like, as well as a few other food options. It was very crowded around 8:20pm and not many tables open. Grab a table and order at the counter."
ChIJy7v_pygmQg0R-yQ0eJBMJPw,5,"Had a fantastic lunch here. They are generous with the portions, at least for me"
ChIJy7v_pygmQg0R-yQ0eJBMJPw,4,overall it is really nice! good price for snack and beer! to go option is 0.5 euros added. food was good and i liked it
ChIJy7v_pygmQg0R-yQ0eJBMJPw,4,"Great kind of fast food, very reasonable prices.
Outside were a lot of pigeons sitting on the tables and eating leftovers but stuff ignored it, disgusting! In women's toilet was no lock."
ChIJy7v_pygmQg0R-yQ0eJBMJPw,4,"The food was good and cheap. I would suggest to scan the QR code on the menu to see the set menus in order to save time when ordering. I chose the ‚ÄúNa Ni No‚Äù, ‚Ç¨5 for five of them. Keep in mind that they are small so don‚Äôt be shy to order many of them"
ChIJDcQ1Yh0mQg0Rr9-U2qBbqJY,5,"We loved this restaurant! The environment is amazing, the foods were delicious and they pay attention the gluten sensitivity."
ChIJDcQ1Yh0mQg0Rr9-U2qBbqJY,3,"I‚Äôve been to other locations of this restaurant. The ambiance of this restaurant was the best, but the service wasn‚Äôt great. First of all we made a reservation and still had to wait 20 minutes for our table. Secondly it took quite a long time to order. With that said, the food was amazing. (As always!!)
There probably weren‚Äôt enough waiters for the amount customers in the restaurant. I‚Äôll definitely be back, but at a less busy moment."
ChIJDcQ1Yh0mQg0Rr9-U2qBbqJY,4,"By far the best mexican food i have tasted in Madrid. The soup was a large portion, was delicious. The nachos, enchilladas, and quesdiellas was perfect üëå.  Only downside i would say was the fajitas which was a bit steep on price and low on portion ( also felt it was dull ). Overall service was quick, staff was friendly and food was perfect. Definitely a revisit to try more of their menu."
ChIJDcQ1Yh0mQg0Rr9-U2qBbqJY,5,"This is TRUE MEXICAN restaurant. The Flavor is pretty legit!!!
Ad for corn tortillas because by default they will give you wheat and those are not as good as the originals.
The service is ok and the best recomendaci√≥n for drinking is a michelada with camato and a traditional Corona.
The best way to do the reservation is via TheFork.es"
ChIJDcQ1Yh0mQg0Rr9-U2qBbqJY,4,Good food with Excellent friendly service
ChIJv9OX-RkmQg0RPfsrHa2xQx8,5,"Flavorful food, made without pretentious explanations or fancy names. great service well informed and reliable staff. Chill atmosphere, what I expect when I go to a beer bar. Both beer and food menus are simple and easy to choose. Thanks, will definitely return next time I am in Madrid"
ChIJv9OX-RkmQg0RPfsrHa2xQx8,5,"Modern but not cold, upbeat, welcoming place... Have figured out the food vs. craft beer balance well (often one or the other suffers when trying to do both) Service was outstanding, food excellent and great beer.  What more could anyone ask for?"
ChIJv9OX-RkmQg0RPfsrHa2xQx8,5,"Great burgers and a solid list of draft craft beers.  Also, cans and bottles"
ChIJv9OX-RkmQg0RPfsrHa2xQx8,5,"Great beer. For a hazy guy like me this was a great find!  good appetizers, good food and ambience.  Family friendly atmosphere.  Friendly staff. Would come again and recommend!"
ChIJv9OX-RkmQg0RPfsrHa2xQx8,5,Their vegan burger is delicious. I highly enjoyed their selection of crafted soda. Large selection of craft beer on draft and in bottle. Amazing service and friendly staff.
ChIJg7X6HQMmQg0RLtUxnHnyhuo,4,"Tapas. ¬°Las mejores anchoas, boquerones, verduas al horno! Todo buenisimo.
Four years after posting this the price to quality is not the same. S
But it is still very good."
ChIJg7X6HQMmQg0RLtUxnHnyhuo,5,I love the food.. the ambient.. the most important the friendly owners Carlos and Mar..
ChIJg7X6HQMmQg0RLtUxnHnyhuo,5,"The food is great but the service is outstanding, out waitress was the best, such a sweet and caring person ü´∂üèª"
ChIJg7X6HQMmQg0RLtUxnHnyhuo,2,"Average and dull. Food was really average. We took several dishes for sharing and were disappointed. When we ordered icecream my girlfriend tasted dish soap, which I also tasted then we saw some green deposit at the bottom of the bowl. Staff responded quite well and thats the reason for the two stars.

Setting was nice"
ChIJg7X6HQMmQg0RLtUxnHnyhuo,4,"Great unlikely restaurant, looks like a small bar. But go in go down and be ready for a surprise. Good service food and ambiance. We will be returning."
ChIJ4yFBjqcoQg0R6UfC74oXz5E,5,"This is what is meant by a ""Hidden Gem""

I think nobody will walk past this restaurant by accident. It is hidden down a dull looking alley in a primarily residential area.

But, once you start to walk down the alley, you see lights, you see a beautiful outdoor dining terrace behind green foliage, then you enter the restaurant.

First there is the bar area, which is very inviting. When I announced my reservation, I was shown to a table inside. It was clean, sharp, white linen, and a much larger room than I had thought. There even appeared to be a 'private' table on an upper mezzanine for larger groups.

My servers and I had fun with Spanglish, resorting to Google translate when needed.

I ordered three appetizers, as the first two were not available. What did this mean? I'm guessing if they can't get it fresh, they don't get it !

I ended up with a 1/2 order of grilled cuttle fish followed by very lightly battered hake, with fries(sorry) and a lovely glass of rose wine.

Cuttle fish was a very nice 8/10, but the Hake, WOW ! I think 10/10 did not do it justice. This restaurant specializes in MULTIPLE preparations of Hake.

When I'm next in Madrid, my only decision is do I eat here my first night or my last, it's FANTASTIC !"
ChIJ4yFBjqcoQg0R6UfC74oXz5E,5,"Absolutely a great destination worth making a reservation the restaurant is a galician type food with great meats like Lomo alto and awesome fish like merluza and pichin. We had a side of pimientos rojos and fries.
The atmosphere is great
The service is well done very professional and I must admit we will be back because it is well worth it
The wine list is actually very good they have a well stocked cellar and the place gets very busy.
The outside has a well heated covered area and it is worth trying to be seated there inside it gets a little load.
Parking is a challenge but there is a parking location not far away.
Save  room for dessert because the flan or the cheesecake are well worth the sin."
ChIJ4yFBjqcoQg0R6UfC74oXz5E,5,"Found via Google Maps. What a gem, place has been running for 40y. It‚Äôs more on the pricey side but super good quality with food and service. Also on the terrace they have water mist cooling and fans."
ChIJ4yFBjqcoQg0R6UfC74oXz5E,5,"Was taken there by local colleagues, nice food, nice big terrace, great local (Galician) wine. Desserts will raise the temperature of the place ;) Not in the city centre, but I feel it's worth the walk."
ChIJ4yFBjqcoQg0R6UfC74oXz5E,5,"Awesome place, food is great, good selection of Galician food to choose from. Luis, the waiter, was an excellent server and a wonderful human beingüëç"
ChIJA5uz76YoQg0RIk6U_WD_mX0,3,Good pizzas for a good price. The problem is that we cannot take away our pizzas home when we didn‚Äôt finish it. The AC is turned on so it is a bit cold
ChIJA5uz76YoQg0RIk6U_WD_mX0,5,"Great food. As with the rest of Madrid, it is difficult to get around if you do not speak Spanish"
ChIJA5uz76YoQg0RIk6U_WD_mX0,2,They bring you a pizza (15 min late) with half the box completely soaked in oil and say it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
ChIJA5uz76YoQg0RIk6U_WD_mX0,5,Service was great and fast. catered for alot of people and the pizza was lovely! We ordered 14 pizza's and all say outside at the table enjoying the great weather of Madrid.
ChIJA5uz76YoQg0RIk6U_WD_mX0,5,Every time we must go to eat pizza when we near there.like it very much.
ChIJb6xBbqgoQg0R-VfzVEnZWvI,5,"Honestly one of the best places I've had a meal in Spain. The amazing service to the delicious food. This is truly a gem of a place. If you're looking for a great place for good food. This is the go to!

I'm typing this as I am sitting here and just wow!!!!"
ChIJb6xBbqgoQg0R-VfzVEnZWvI,5,"Big night ! Thanks again, i'll come everytime i go to Madrid ! üòÅ
Bon prix et superbe accueil !"
ChIJb6xBbqgoQg0R-VfzVEnZWvI,5,Great food and service in the Retiro District!
ChIJb6xBbqgoQg0R-VfzVEnZWvI,5,We his tired the restaurant because my son wanted to eat pasta bolognese. I ate lubina. All was very good. Family friendly.
ChIJb6xBbqgoQg0R-VfzVEnZWvI,5,The best Restaurant in Madrid. excellent service. We had a great time with the family üòä. Highly recommend. Thank you Osvaldo. You Rock!. The best chef in Spain. Magaly y Leandro Castano.
ChIJGUl4jKcoQg0RxAPCXZwC_Ps,5,"Last minute was trying to get some food on Friday evening at 10pm and luckily stumbled upon the Lima Limon in our area. We were a bit on the cautious side as we didn't know what to expect due to some previous reviews.

Outcome ? The food was amazing - actually exceeded our expectations. The service was fast, the food was tasty.

We got lomo saltado and ceviche and was very good couldn't have asked for more.

This seems to be a family restaurant and if too busy likely to be understaffed quickly.

Also note that there's an extra charge for eating at the terrace which will likely put some people off - for example chevice came with 2 euros extra on the bill."
ChIJGUl4jKcoQg0RxAPCXZwC_Ps,5,"One of THE BEST experiences during my stay in Madrid. The food was phenomenal. But beyond that, the service. The servers waited with us and even stayed to explain things to our non-spanish speaking friends. The flavors were new and am so glad we stumbled over this."
ChIJGUl4jKcoQg0RxAPCXZwC_Ps,5,"very tasty and good service.

they offer set dishes with starter, one main dish, one desert and one drink, which cost only 15Euros.  The food is delicious and the house wine is also nice.

highly recommend"
ChIJGUl4jKcoQg0RxAPCXZwC_Ps,2,"Based on 1 experience.
The place is nice, and clean (I appreciated that).
Service/staff is ok.
Food was not that good. The fish, in a ceviche, was not properly cleaned (the skin). The rice was dry/overcooked. Some food too salty.
Price was rather high for the received quality."
ChIJGUl4jKcoQg0RxAPCXZwC_Ps,4,"The food was great, perhaps the best I have eaten in a Peruvian restaurant. Not the cheapest but not expensive given the quality. I'll definitely be back"
ChIJQwHSjgImQg0RjsubTT5wyHE,4,"A very pleasant ambiance in modern decor with pleasant music - tour group food, always a risk for minimum cost, was 8 dishes all pleasantly satisfying with the right amount of salt (many restaurants fail this - are they seeking ‚Äòhealthy low salt‚Äô ? - resulting in low or no taste ‚Äôif it has no salt - spit it out‚Äô) - cabbage and broccoli had the right amount of crunch - everyone in our tour group loved it and was very happy afterwords - other Chinese tour group restaurants could take a lesson from here."
ChIJQwHSjgImQg0RjsubTT5wyHE,1,"Cucumbers were sour, and the denialist  waitress denied that it was sour, having not tasted it. The waitress then had the audacity to argue and debate for 15 minutes. The waitress then left the argument  and, not even 5 minutes later, attempted to call us liars and attempted to decieve and lie she also attempted to reignite the argument. People with me then shut her attempts at arguing and lying down and for the rest of the evening whenever she served us she had a horrific attitude and  muttered comments. She then forced us to pay half price even though we had only 3 medium sized plates of sushi. The food was really bad quality and the avocado's were black."
ChIJQwHSjgImQg0RjsubTT5wyHE,5,I was very surprised with this place! Everything we ordered tasted amazing. My favorite dish was the Oyster sauce beef! The staff fast and polite and the restaurant very clean and modern. I would definitely come back.
ChIJQwHSjgImQg0RjsubTT5wyHE,5,"We ate there because our hotel was next to it. The food was freshly made and tasted very good. We liked the concept of ""all you can eat"", but without a buffet."
ChIJQwHSjgImQg0RjsubTT5wyHE,5,This is an amazing restaurant with a wide range of excellent food at a reasonable price. The restaurant is very clean and the staff are lovely and friendly.
ChIJ6f4mGKcoQg0RbimgEc5i7L0,5,"One of the few cafes open past 10pm in Madrid. Great and cozy environment with a charming decor and a lovely owner who really takes care of his customers. The Lotus cookie is a must try.
Would definitely recommend, and the coffee really hits the spot too."
ChIJ6f4mGKcoQg0RbimgEc5i7L0,5,"I was looking for a good coffee spot (not a restaurant) in the area of Parque del Retiro, which wasn‚Äôt easy, but I found this really nice caf√© where I had excellent specialty coffee from Peru and a tasty pastry. The place is small but cozy and also has a terrace on the street. Dani provides the best service. I highly recommend giving it a chance."
ChIJ6f4mGKcoQg0RbimgEc5i7L0,5,"On our stay in Madrid we discovered this very nice little street cafe because it looked very good. We came back a lot of times because the coffee was really good and we really liked it there. You can also order every coffee and drink with almond milk, soy milk or oat milk so it‚Äôs a very good place if you are vegan or don‚Äôt want to drink milk. When it‚Äôs hot outside I would recommend trying an iced latte as it‚Äôs really refreshing. You can sit outside and enjoy your cold drink while enjoying the nice weather. The food is also really good the focaccia and the tamale was great and tasted really good. I should not forget that this carrot cake was outstanding and you should really try it if you come here. The barista Leo is a very nice and friendly person. It was really nice talking to him even though we only spoke a bit of Spanish. We are the next time in Madrid we will definitely come back."
ChIJ6f4mGKcoQg0RbimgEc5i7L0,4,Good place for a cafe and chill with people. Many varieties of cafes and cakes are available.
ChIJ6f4mGKcoQg0RbimgEc5i7L0,5,Best place for a quick meal all day. 7:30-10:30. Amazing service. Leo and Daniel gave us great recommendations and we have been here 3 times in 4 days! Great prices and great quality food. Avocado toast is a must!
ChIJrf6so58oQg0RmYi1aRqOQVU,1,"Had a very nice small ice cream cone. Delicious but a rip-off. I assumed that it would be the same price as other food stalls around the park (around ‚Ç¨3),  incorrect - it was ‚Ç¨6.  üò≠"
ChIJrf6so58oQg0RmYi1aRqOQVU,1,"Terrible service. We sat there for at least 20 minutes and we were totally ignored regardless the reminders to staff. The place was not full. In any case, at some point we left,  dissapointed, without having being served or been given any attention."
ChIJrf6so58oQg0RmYi1aRqOQVU,2,"What's good of this place? The park where it is. That's it.
Located in the middle of the beautiful park Retiro this place is absolutely awful.
Dirty, crowded with really disgusting expansive food.
We ordered some Nachos with cheddar. The cheers was super cold and the plate costed 9‚Ç¨. 9 euro for a small plate of nachos!!!
Two stars only because the waitress was friendly and because the well location in the park.
In any case I discourage to come this place!"
ChIJrf6so58oQg0RmYi1aRqOQVU,5,"Stopped for a quick bite while waking the park. Got 2 short beers and a margarita pizza that were both brought out promptly and tasted good. Can‚Äôt speak much for price comparison, our total was 17 euros. Contrary to the negative reviews, had quick service that was  responsive and brought by the check and had us resolved with ease."
ChIJrf6so58oQg0RmYi1aRqOQVU,1,"We sat for more than 15 minutes watching the waiters serve others and clear tables. Then, when we were not served and could not attract the attention of waiting staff, we left, still thirsty:-("
ChIJy0DN4KYoQg0RzMQDh09dBRU,5,"The paella was super nice. Lovely place with great family like atmosphere.
Highly recommend if you are around Retiro ‚ù§Ô∏èWould go back any time!"
ChIJy0DN4KYoQg0RzMQDh09dBRU,4,"I love their mixed paella. Much better than other places. So good I had it twice while in Madrid.  Near Retiro Park and definitely worth a stop to this great find.  Not touristy,  but a local place you shouldn‚Äôt miss."
ChIJy0DN4KYoQg0RzMQDh09dBRU,5,Very nice experience. The Paella was very good.
ChIJy0DN4KYoQg0RzMQDh09dBRU,3,"it was nice local food, but not very tasty, and the service was not bad but not very good as well. i think that the price was too high for what we have ordered a t-bone steak, prones in garlic salad with avocado and 2 beers around 75 Eur including service. it was also quite noisy,"
ChIJy0DN4KYoQg0RzMQDh09dBRU,5,"The paella was delicious, we met the owner Miguel was very nice and helpful"
ChIJ8dHBcQQmQg0RTmAUw4EbIDI,5,"One of the best vegan restaurants in Madrid! The food is amazing, the portions are great for the price and the quality and the staff is super friendly!

Maikki, the tartar and the banana burger were some of my favourites! Next time I will try the cheesecake which looked amazing

All of my family, who isn't vegan, loved it too!"
ChIJ8dHBcQQmQg0RTmAUw4EbIDI,5,"The food is amazing! For me it‚Äôs the best vegan restaurant I‚Äôve been to;the service is amazing too ,kind ,casual and attentive .
Thank you so much for a great time."
ChIJ8dHBcQQmQg0RTmAUw4EbIDI,5,"The food was awesome! We ate the Americana burger and the babaganush, both were very good. The burger could fool me (its vegan obvisously)
The desserts were equally good and with big servings.

The staff is super friendly and helpfull!"
ChIJ8dHBcQQmQg0RTmAUw4EbIDI,5,My first day in Madrid and I came across this great vegan cafe.  I got the La Plantano burger and it was absolutely delicious.  The atmosphere is cozy and warm.
ChIJ8dHBcQQmQg0RTmAUw4EbIDI,5,"Very good experience. Creative cuisine, beautifully presented and full of flavours.
The atmosphere is cute and staff is super friendly.

All in all, an excellent option in Madrid.

10/10. Well deserved."
ChIJU9hxgQMmQg0RBoLHac6tgvU,2,"Spacious restaurant and ideal to enjoy meals here with friends. They have indoor and outdoor dining covered for winter. The service we received was disingenuous, unfortunately. We were also very disappointed that the sauce for the patatas bravas was very little we can barely taste it. I don‚Äôt understand why they are putting so little sauce. Providing enough sauce will not make the business bankrupt so why not put a good amount of that sauce? It will make a lot of difference to the customer."
ChIJU9hxgQMmQg0RBoLHac6tgvU,1,"Would not recommend this place. Went here today (November 29) for dinner. We were greeted and seated by a good staff member but our waiter was a tall, big, bald dude with a bad bad attitude. While I ordered the whitetail my wife ordered a vegetarian dish. He was irritated and impatient when my wife ordered a vegetarian dish. As for the whitetail, he smirked and asked ""is that all"" for my order. He dropped off a bread basket while we waited for the food. My whitetail came with no sauce, no flavor and some fish on paper. He rudely dropped off the plate and walked off. I couldn't finish much and we asked for the bill/check. When the bill arrived we noticed another item on the check which we hadn't ordered for. It seems he had added the bread basket which we neither ordered not ate. While pointing this out, he walked off in anger and dropped the updated bill without the bread basket. Neither the food nor the attitude helped with the evening and has been the only BAD EXPERIENCE in our 6day Madrid trip."
ChIJU9hxgQMmQg0RBoLHac6tgvU,5,"The best experience and taste, the best "" patatas bravas and croquetas ""
They are keeping the traditional dishes in which is a plus.
I recommend it to everyone who wants to taste and enjoy the best Spanish dishes!"
ChIJU9hxgQMmQg0RBoLHac6tgvU,5,"This is the best Cruz Blanca in Madrid, very good food and friendly service. Prices are reasonable for the quality offered. It is the right place for having a well served men√∫ del d√≠a or for a tapas diner."
ChIJU9hxgQMmQg0RBoLHac6tgvU,5,Awesome food especially the pulpo
ChIJibJyqacoQg0RXslA1Re4JTg,4,"This is a local place and we were excited to try it. The tamale did not have meat and was a lot of masa. They served it with pickled onions and it was good. The chicken and rice was fine too, we would've used black pepper or hot sauce on both. The staff is very friendly and helpful."
ChIJibJyqacoQg0RXslA1Re4JTg,4,Fantastic venue. Personal and very impressive. Had a great time for my 40th. Definitely deserve a repeat visit.
ChIJibJyqacoQg0RXslA1Re4JTg,5,"Outstanding service and delicious food! It was affordable, home-made and so tasty! The turkey wasn't dry, and that's really hard to achieve. The owner is very warm and welcoming. We'll be back!"
ChIJibJyqacoQg0RXslA1Re4JTg,5,Delicious home-made food!
ChIJibJyqacoQg0RXslA1Re4JTg,5,"For about a month and a half I have been eating in from time to time or ordering takeout. Everything is delicious and super well priced (especially the lunch menu). If you go on a Friday for lunch or dinner, you will enjoy its typical Peruvian dishes. Besides, a very calm place with a very good atmosphere to talk."
ChIJg7eb6aYoQg0RXpu0Cdo49lA,5,"Great mexican dinner.
The selection of food and beer was wide (they had a vegan option as wel) and everything was .delicius. the staff was nice and the service quick and precises. loved this mexican beer.

The space is nice and cozy. I will be back for sure to try different plates."
ChIJg7eb6aYoQg0RXpu0Cdo49lA,5,"I love the tacos in this place, I wasn't  so confident about this place, but the service was really good and the food was really really good also, loved the tacos we ordered and the orchard was ok, a little over sweet. But the tacos was really similar to the ones I have tryed in Mexico."
ChIJg7eb6aYoQg0RXpu0Cdo49lA,5,Tacazzo has incredible Margaritas and other mixed drinks. The food is moderately upscale and delicious. Highly recommended!
ChIJg7eb6aYoQg0RXpu0Cdo49lA,5,"We were in Madrid for the weekend and went to watch a match and eat nachos and drink beer here and it was so good ü•≥ service is very welcoming and friendly, the interior is so vibey and unique and overall everything perfectttttt"
ChIJg7eb6aYoQg0RXpu0Cdo49lA,5,The tacos and staff are in a stiff competition to be the best. I loved the food and the care they took during the pandemic
ChIJC6A_waYoQg0R27-kaGsP3ZQ,5,"I went to lunch the other day with a friend and we left very happy. We ordered two pizzas, two drinks, two desserts and a coffee and paid just over ‚Ç¨12 per head. Delicious food at a good price"
ChIJC6A_waYoQg0R27-kaGsP3ZQ,3,"We were a group of four when they were starting, the place was empty so the service was good and the atmosphere was pleasant. The pasta was somewhat hard, it didn't surprise us too much. We will return to find out if it has improved.
That's if the owner is charming and willing to improve."
ChIJC6A_waYoQg0R27-kaGsP3ZQ,1,"Unfriendly waitresses, bad treatment, slow, all the dishes came out with a big difference in time, so the food stayed cold. The food is reheated. The only thing worth it is the pizza"
ChIJC6A_waYoQg0R27-kaGsP3ZQ,4,"Good food. Good service especially from the manager, very attentive. The menu is good quality/price"
ChIJC6A_waYoQg0R27-kaGsP3ZQ,1,"I give 1 star because you can't give 0, because they didn't even attend to us. 20' waiting for them to at least bring us the letter...and they had no problem. Finally we left because we had to be invisible."
ChIJt7QU96YoQg0R6J58tNlScTk,5,"El Talgo is a fantastic choice any day of the week, but Sunday lunch is especially delightful. Their tartar menu is incredible, and the atmosphere is fantastic.  Make sure to add it to your list of must-try restaurants in Madrid! Reservation is recommend"
ChIJt7QU96YoQg0R6J58tNlScTk,5,"El Talgo was an incredible experience! The atmosphere was warm and inviting, the wine was excellent, and the waitress was especially charming and friendly. The tapas were fantastic, especially the potatoes ‚Äì absolutely delicious. Truly more than 5 out of 5 stars!"
ChIJt7QU96YoQg0R6J58tNlScTk,5,"I cannot say enough about El Talgo and what a lovely evening we had! It's perfect for lunch or dinner after a stroll in the Parque Retiro. The service was wonderful, and the food was absolutely delicious (the brownie with lavender ice cream was to die for - would have included a picture but it was eaten too quickly). The owners, Ana and Jorge, will take care of you as if you were a member of their family. You will be so happy you strolled into this sweet place! Highly recommend!"
ChIJt7QU96YoQg0R6J58tNlScTk,5,I come back in my memories to this place and wonderful owners who were so kind and welcoming! This is by far one of the most delicious and happy places we found on Earth! All the best from my wife and a little Ignacio! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
ChIJt7QU96YoQg0R6J58tNlScTk,5,"Great discovery. This tapas bar is fun, it preserves the essence of Madrid, and you can delight some revamped Spanish tapas while enjoying the kindness of the staff and the great ambience. I recommend trying the 'Torrezno', you can't go wrong with this one. Also the rice with duck, delicious.
5 stars"
ChIJa71raRsmQg0Rxn9xT0wwg1M,4,Tasty food and correct service. The cinnamon roll is a bit expensive for the size offered. Nevertheless it is tasty and served lukewarm.
ChIJa71raRsmQg0Rxn9xT0wwg1M,5,The staff was very friendly.  Food and drink came out in a reasonable time.  Food is great for the price
ChIJa71raRsmQg0Rxn9xT0wwg1M,3,"Since the franchise ownership changed, some time ago, the dish sizes went down, and the prices increased. Use to be a favourite stop for a nice breakfast or quick bite, but not any longer.
On the bright side, Maria, the waitress was exceptionally effective, kind and a real pleasure to deal with.
Unfortunately, the kitchen was not up to it. Scrambled eggs are not a shredded omelette, bacon in the American breakfast was 3 tiny slabs, eggs benedict should be pouched, or at least not the solid yolk of a fried egg.
Once again only the waitress's attitude and hard work saved the experience."
ChIJa71raRsmQg0Rxn9xT0wwg1M,5,"I came here with my family after a busy day around Madrid, the food was lovely and the service was excellent."
ChIJa71raRsmQg0Rxn9xT0wwg1M,4,"We booked a table for eight people. The service was really quick. We ordered hamburgers,sandwiches and drinks. The hamburgers there are incredible, the best in the whole city, however,we also ordered pancakes for dessert and they were a little tough."
ChIJeUFHeScmQg0Ri1pU0-X38gg,5,"Looking for a place to eat on Christmas Eve and this was open! We ordered the Spanish omelet- well done and medium- both yummy. We also got the Iberian flatbread- good flavor, the crust was a hit for some and not for others. Loved the place and service was great + fast. The waitress was wonderful and helpful!"
ChIJeUFHeScmQg0Ri1pU0-X38gg,5,Lucia was an amazing waitress. Pretty area. Nice menu. Decent wine by the glass and they were very accommodating to one of the 6 of us who needdd ‚Äúsin gluten‚Äù.
ChIJeUFHeScmQg0Ri1pU0-X38gg,5,They were very nice and even made an espresso martini for me even though it wasn‚Äôt on the menu. They also had complimentary snacks which were delicious!
ChIJeUFHeScmQg0Ri1pU0-X38gg,5,"We stopped here for a nice lunch and shared some tapas. The superfood salad was our favorite, and we also really enjoyed our flat bread, gyoza and grilled vegetables, and Spanish omelette. This restaurant had a relaxing environment and top notch service. I would highly recommend."
ChIJeUFHeScmQg0Ri1pU0-X38gg,4,"If you want to sit outside, you need to pay extra and I didn‚Äôt know that ofcourse!
But this truffle, cheese mini pizza thing was delicious"
ChIJSzafRKEoQg0RUFQEqRGP2xg,5,"So glad I did my research to eat at this place, the perfect combination of Jam√≥n Ib√©rico with wine. We ordered another side of chorizos and it did not disappoint, everything that we had here was 10/10. The ambience is so homely that you don't know where the time goes."
ChIJSzafRKEoQg0RUFQEqRGP2xg,5,"Great place to have a beer, wine, cheese and ham. The place offers great jamon and cheese dishes so you can enjoy great wines. Highly recommend!"
ChIJSzafRKEoQg0RUFQEqRGP2xg,5,"This place is brilliant!
The ham and cheeses that the host put together for us was amazing.
I highly recommend this to anybody who wants to try Spanish specialties."
ChIJSzafRKEoQg0RUFQEqRGP2xg,5,Very nice little tapas bar. Service was excellent and when ordering a drink you get really good tapas. Can recommend it.
ChIJSzafRKEoQg0RUFQEqRGP2xg,1,"We ordered an 8‚Ç¨ cheese tapa and got charged a 20‚Ç¨ whole plate. From the begining the waiter seemed pushy and was trying to get us to order more and more. Wouldn't recommend the place at all.
On the contrary, the new young waitress was really nice and tried to apologize on his behalf."
ChIJj1vKOqEoQg0R38BqgkYAvak,5,WOW what a find a proper traditional Spanish restaurant offering fresh cooked honest authentic meals. After having spent a few days eating meals in the tourist areas trying to capture the Spanish cuisine but not really hitting the mark it was then a delight to find this humble and very friendly staff restaurant. It‚Äôs ideally situated next to the El Retiro Park so makes a real add-on to your day when visiting the park. It has a very comprehensive menu and a very efficient service - best restaurant and value we had visited in our stay in Madrid.
ChIJj1vKOqEoQg0R38BqgkYAvak,5,"Our server Maria was super attentive, helpful and patient. She had great dish recommendations and was very kind. We really enjoyed our time here. The ambiance was calm but lively. I felt it was customary Spanish food."
ChIJj1vKOqEoQg0R38BqgkYAvak,5,Late afternoon service was excellent. Food and drink were very tasty and the servers were attentive to your needs.
ChIJj1vKOqEoQg0R38BqgkYAvak,5,"Warm tostada con fresh real tomatoes. Clean and calm ambience. Staff are cordial.

Menu del dia has large serving size at affordable price, taste good, service was fast. Highly recommend."
ChIJj1vKOqEoQg0R38BqgkYAvak,5,Breakfast was good but not menu so had to order from options given by waitress. Service was fast and bill seemed reasonable. Could see many locals having coffee so must be popular
ChIJCTjtVRomQg0RX8LSo-T1L-I,1,Took a gamble on this place and lost‚Ä¶both my husband and I got food poisoning and ended up running from bathroom to bathroom the following day. My guess is it was the croquettes that did us dirty.
ChIJCTjtVRomQg0RX8LSo-T1L-I,5,"This place is absolutely wonderful! They provide great food and even greater service. It‚Äôs a perfect place for an authentic, local Spanish experience!"
ChIJCTjtVRomQg0RX8LSo-T1L-I,3,Basic menu but very tasty fresh juice
ChIJCTjtVRomQg0RX8LSo-T1L-I,5,Good place for get one pause ‚èØÔ∏è
ChIJCTjtVRomQg0RX8LSo-T1L-I,3,Nice staff and prompt service
ChIJAQBAaBkmQg0RRREfbRm52K0,4,"Very good for the price bracket. Friendly staff, nice experience, very clean toilets too."
ChIJAQBAaBkmQg0RRREfbRm52K0,5,I had a nice local breakfast with a fast service and very friendly staff!!
ChIJAQBAaBkmQg0RRREfbRm52K0,5,A good choice on this side of the park for breakfast and coffee. A good bread selection for takeout too. Good prices.
ChIJAQBAaBkmQg0RRREfbRm52K0,1,"Our order two beef steaks, one salad. Our steaks full of fat. Our salad nothing special. For my opinion to expensive."
ChIJAQBAaBkmQg0RRREfbRm52K0,4,A favourite spot. Great service. Relaxed atmosphere. Good grub
ChIJg1-9GBkmQg0R4l1EX3xbRP4,5,"Incredible value, lovely food and such hospitality from the staff. Absolute angels who dealt very well with my bad grasp of Spanish.
I recommend the ensalada casa Ruth (lovely fish salad with thinly sliced onion) and pollo asado al moscatel.
The menu of the day is not to be missed."
ChIJg1-9GBkmQg0R4l1EX3xbRP4,5,"Tiny, but fantastic restaurant! The owner makes her food in-house and has some fantastic meal options. Highly recommend the house specialties!"
ChIJg1-9GBkmQg0R4l1EX3xbRP4,5,"Casa Ruth is small just like Ruth.  But good things come in small packages.  Two coffees, 2 orders of eggs, bacon and potatoes, all cooked to perfection, ‚Ç¨16.   Ruth is lovely and speaks enough english.  Locals come here."
ChIJg1-9GBkmQg0R4l1EX3xbRP4,5,The food was really good the prices were good as well. The service wasn‚Äôt the best. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a friendly place but not rude either.
ChIJg1-9GBkmQg0R4l1EX3xbRP4,5,Casa Ruth was excellent. The set menu for lunch was amazing and the service was perfect!
ChIJG-dflnInQg0R_sao0a10KoI,5,Amazing pizza with great topping choices. Staff was friendly and food came fast also the place looks really nice.
ChIJG-dflnInQg0R_sao0a10KoI,5,"Truly delicious food in a very lovely place. Service was fabulous! Our waitress Fiorella was so chatty and polite, nothing was too much trouble for her, she made our visit here very relaxed and enjoyable."
ChIJG-dflnInQg0R_sao0a10KoI,5,Fast and friendly service. Fair prices for pizza size. Good and tasty options. After visiting 2 times I can recommend thin crust family pizza as enough for 2 ppl.
ChIJG-dflnInQg0R_sao0a10KoI,1,"Apparently if you get a large pizza, they will just transport it at a 45 degree angle"
ChIJG-dflnInQg0R_sao0a10KoI,1,"Ordered through Uber Eats. Delivery 45 mins late from the latest estimated (1h30mins in total). Pizza bland, tasteless. Not even cut into pieces. I can add order reviews for all the other orders through uber eats but not for this order. Wonder if they purposefully turned the option off because their pizza and service is bad."
ChIJewKnXOAnQg0RbZXQpxCaALc,5,"I come here when I feel homesick, there's nothing like a good, cheesy, hot and crispy cheese empanada, A VENEZUELAN EMPANADA, the best kind! (And with guasacaca of course, it's a must!!)"
ChIJewKnXOAnQg0RbZXQpxCaALc,4,√âpico is a good option for tasty Venezuelan food. The empanadas are great. The cachapas have room for improvement.
ChIJewKnXOAnQg0RbZXQpxCaALc,5,Terrific food and friendly service every time. Best arepas in the barrio!
ChIJewKnXOAnQg0RbZXQpxCaALc,5,Went in for a burger and staid for two.
ChIJewKnXOAnQg0RbZXQpxCaALc,5,Venezuelan food at its best. Just a couple of blocks from Atocha train station...
ChIJefvtKaYoQg0RmV_hn3XpBNI,5,"This place is seriously good. Guillermo has a fantastic knowledge of Gin and Whisky and my aperitif was wonderful - but this is to say nothing of the food which was fantastic -  as well the gentle but excellent music and the ambiance. I had the truffle pasta - its Michelin star quality. Seek this place out, it is very near the east side of the Retiro and the Ibiza metro station - you will not be disappointed."
ChIJefvtKaYoQg0RmV_hn3XpBNI,5,Fresh pasta and thin pizza. Amazing terrace
ChIJefvtKaYoQg0RmV_hn3XpBNI,5,"I have been coming here for years and just realized that I never gave a review. The food is excellent. Not many dishes on the menu, especially during the pandemic, but all great. Love the original carbonara, the pasta with wild boar ragout and the pizzas. The whiskey menu IS extensive, as is the gin one. Simply great and highly recommended."
ChIJefvtKaYoQg0RmV_hn3XpBNI,5,"Small, cute Italian restaurant with amazing food, a extensive spirits range (literally hundreds of whisky, rum, gin, vodka and champagne brands) and a nice outdoor spot to have dinner in summer. Owner is a great connoisseur of whisky and rum so take advantage of his wisdom."
ChIJefvtKaYoQg0RmV_hn3XpBNI,3,"Menu a bit more interesting than a usual Italian although a bit pricey. Really extensive gin and whiskey list possibly gain an extra star, but the service wasn't friendly enough and the food was no more than ok."
ChIJeXfJOwImQg0R2zCOcQ873c0,4,This is one of a few places that were open on a Sunday afternoon near my hotel. One can order from the menu or get some of the already prepared dishes. We had a delicious chicken and vegetable paella which was a steal at 7.50 euros per serving. The cheesecake was rich and not too sweet. The glass of  tinto montecil was refreshing. This lunch was a bargain except for the banana that cost 3.50 euros.
ChIJeXfJOwImQg0R2zCOcQ873c0,1,"Could not be uglier, did not go in because it looked nasty!!!!!"
ChIJeXfJOwImQg0R2zCOcQ873c0,5,"Nice kid friendly restaurant. Had a wonderful lunch there. We don't speak Spanish, and still our waiter could understand us and recommended great dishes for us. Will definitely go back. Fast service too!"
ChIJeXfJOwImQg0R2zCOcQ873c0,1,"Bad quality, hard and dry meat (beef). I do not recommend."
ChIJeXfJOwImQg0R2zCOcQ873c0,4,"We visited for a coffe, and didn't try the food menu. It's a nice placen to have a coffe."
ChIJPclpD_8lQg0RBKWy_pyhH_g,5,i always come here when I'm hungry. I love it and I recommend it for any type of circumstances if you are looking for good and cheap food. I have already made it a tradition to come here every Friday.
ChIJPclpD_8lQg0RBKWy_pyhH_g,4,"Normal McDonald's. Has totems for selecting and paying. Few people working there though, so sometimes people make a little of a mess with their plates."
ChIJPclpD_8lQg0RBKWy_pyhH_g,3,Always a reliable Maccas very fast and super friendly
ChIJPclpD_8lQg0RBKWy_pyhH_g,1,Not fast food. Waited 10 minutes at the counter inside and was told I had to order outside. The manager is a clown
ChIJPclpD_8lQg0RBKWy_pyhH_g,5,Just like any other McDonald's in the US. This one is open late at night through the express window
ChIJ_31N2f4lQg0R5hnckMThwz0,5,"Good food and price.  Meal including two rounds of soft drinks came to ‚Ç¨100.50 which works out better to be ‚Ç¨14 each.

Great service and good doing burgers and platers of various types.

Parking outside the shop which is great!!!"
ChIJ_31N2f4lQg0R5hnckMThwz0,1,"Despite de fact that only 3 customers were on the restaurant, I had to wait over 25 mins to get my order, plus I had to listen to a terrible Latin music the whole stay, although I went to the American restaurant to enjoy the American music and environment as the company stands for, food was ok, won‚Äôt come back"
ChIJ_31N2f4lQg0R5hnckMThwz0,4,"Good Foster's chain restaurant place.
Food is varied: texmex + burguers.
Expect kids + families around, lunch menu m-f is great value."
ChIJ_31N2f4lQg0R5hnckMThwz0,5,Super deli¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°
ChIJ_31N2f4lQg0R5hnckMThwz0,4,"Very well attended, the place very clean and tidy, quite a good atmosphere, the food is good but it is not anything out of the ordinary either, I ordered an entrec√¥te and it was a piece of grilled meat with salt, no more no less, the The chili sauce for the nachos is from the supermarket and was sour, apparently old, the beans were soft to the point of falling apart, but from there, the rest was good, the highlight was the carbonara, it was delicious. A good place to go with the family, quite well organized and with space to enjoy without disturbing or being disturbed."
ChIJ57jEIAEmQg0RbWyVZSBIqGA,5,Great customer service. Food was great lots of options and big portions. We sat in the terrace had some ribs and a a small cachopo and we were completely full.
ChIJ57jEIAEmQg0RbWyVZSBIqGA,1,Either the prices are super high or they overcharged us.  For this kind of bar it is extremely expensive.
ChIJ57jEIAEmQg0RbWyVZSBIqGA,5,Great!
ChIJ57jEIAEmQg0RbWyVZSBIqGA,5,"Unbeatable food and service. Andr√©s was very attentive and kind. The dishes arrived super coordinated, little by little and without rushing. We loved all the dishes but I would highlight the shrimp purulents, the ribs and the croquettes.
We will return for sure!"
ChIJ57jEIAEmQg0RbWyVZSBIqGA,4,"I EDITED REVIEW and raised a star for the attention of the owner. After the review he was interested in knowing what happened and paying attention to the future.

I went to eat with some relatives and we ordered several portions, a main dish and desserts.
I liked the portions and the alfajores for dessert were also very good.
However, I noticed the cod main dish was stale and had a bad smell. I mentioned it to the waiter so he could take it to the kitchen and report it. I received no response; Since there were many of us at the table, they ignored him. Another person also confirmed to me that their cod dish was not good. I hope it was something specific and that in the future they check the fish before serving it."
ChIJq4Zf_qgoQg0Rs1FBzgo-bBY,5,I'm English and they tried to communicate as I also tried to use Spanish and everything was amazing.
ChIJq4Zf_qgoQg0Rs1FBzgo-bBY,2,"The service is very rude. They don't even want to try to communicate in English. A lady of about 40 years old said in a raised tone that she would only speak Spanish. Tourist, I do not recommend"
ChIJq4Zf_qgoQg0Rs1FBzgo-bBY,5,"We were visiting from Canada and was staying at a nearby hotel.
The place has great food,reasonable prices , and attentive staff."
ChIJq4Zf_qgoQg0Rs1FBzgo-bBY,5,"You may think portions are small, but each and every simple dish would be delicious. Staff is very attentive and always with the smile. This place makes me come back again and again."
ChIJq4Zf_qgoQg0Rs1FBzgo-bBY,5,"Every dish was perfectly balanced and tasted better than anything else I've eaten in Spain. An incredible find, highly recommend!"
ChIJEWXLjagoQg0RqrqFeKHI248,4,"Homemade food service, the lasagna is very decent, they always have anchovies in vinegar, they specialize in roast chicken. A good option to avoid complications"
ChIJEWXLjagoQg0RqrqFeKHI248,1,"Roasted chicken more done inside and out would be more appetizing. I had to bake it when I got home because it was super pale. There were no people, so I think there is little outlet for the dishes, because the chicken had been off the grill for a while.
I expected other quality and more care.
A grill without a simple carver, but with the blow of an ax, leaves much to be desired."
ChIJEWXLjagoQg0RqrqFeKHI248,1,"Good robbery.
‚Ç¨8.60 for a mini tupperware of cooked potatoes with aioli (the typical bad bar potatoes) and a mini tupperware with two Russian fillets in tomato sauce (it looked like fried tomato from a jar).
I had been in the neighborhood all my life and I had never dared to buy food, my intuition was right!"
ChIJEWXLjagoQg0RqrqFeKHI248,3,"The food seems healthy. The right price/quality ratio. The place is small, so now you have to wait on the street. They serve well and quickly. The place is not well decorated, although the food looks good. There are better looking but more expensive establishments in the neighborhood."
ChIJEWXLjagoQg0RqrqFeKHI248,1,"Yesterday I bought a Villeroy brisket. When I cut it to eat, the stale smell of the chicken made me get up from the table and go to the store to return the breast. They refunded my money without even apologizing. I suggest a visit from Health since I don't think it's the only thing in bad condition in those chambers."
ChIJMWnaLKgoQg0R7pwqjMaSosc,2,"Living in Italy for 8 years I have minimum expectations from an Italian experience. Fair expectations.

First being in Spain with Sangria on the menu I thought a jug would be good, to see the quality, I was told it wasn't available in a jug only a glass and after much discussion, I ordered a glass of house wine.

Yay for Italy, not so yay for a bit of Spanish
influence. If you have it on the menu, have it available. It's Sangria IN SPAIN!! Don't disappoint your customer! There are hotels all around you.

My waitress was just disgraceful, honestly in ALL MY YEARS I've never been served by a waiter/waitress that was actually talking on the phone while serving. Do you even have the slightest comprehension what message this sends REGARDLESS how good your chef is. Wow, I know Steve Jobs and Johnny Ive wanted the iPhone to be an extension of our bodies, but really? You need to get your front house in order.
Back of house, bread came out, it was fine, what I expected, and then the main, well I could pick it apart like a vulture could a carcass. Why? Because your waitress has made me feel so much like an inconvenience I could taste it.
So here goes.
The bread was fine, see the pic, nothing special, the main came out and looked GREAT..... however, the oil, damn, did you produce this in Saudi Arabia? There's more oil in this meal than Saudi Arabia.
Your front of house let you down. Big time. It doesn't matter how good your food is, if your front house isn't, your customer isn't happy, but the food just wasn't that good anyway.

The Red wine I'd preferred was Sangria was great and a solid pour, so I included that in the review because fair is fair.

You're back end would last in tourist traps in Italy but wouldn't survive local justice with the oil you use and your front end would have your doors closed in a week. Time to wake up Mr Gino, your employees are letting your name slide."
ChIJMWnaLKgoQg0R7pwqjMaSosc,4,"Four of us ate here as we were staying in a local hotel.
The food was excellent (we had three different main courses) and the portions quite large. A surprise that they had no bread though - apart from Garlic.

There was no real atmosphere, but overall, a pleasant experience."
ChIJMWnaLKgoQg0R7pwqjMaSosc,5,"The pepperoni pizza was good if, perhaps, a bit greasy.  Beer was reasonably priced. I enjoyed my time at Gino‚Äôs. It was very convenient that they are open between lunch and dinner."
ChIJMWnaLKgoQg0R7pwqjMaSosc,3,"I had the risotto with mushrooms, and it was evident that they had the rice precooked and only mix it with some sauce before serving. They didn‚Äôt even mix it well, there were parts of plain rice (see pictures). The flavor was decent, but still too salty.
They served me as a starter some olives that looked dry and like they‚Äôve been sitting outside for hours. Also had the tiramisu, which was ok, but a little too soggy.
The waitress was un-attentive, and all of then looked like they didn‚Äôt want to be there.
Wouldn‚Äôt go back."
ChIJMWnaLKgoQg0R7pwqjMaSosc,4,"Other reviews are quite accurate, food is very good, didn'ttake the picture ofvthe salmon ravioli until half way throughbut oh so tasty, price is also good, service is a bit iffy"
ChIJMWnaLKgoQg0RFrga94aFunI,2,"This is what happens when you try to serve plain, regular Chinese food in a white tablecloth five star setting. Neither the service nor the food quality match the high-end look of the interior.

It's a shame they didn't put the effort and energy into their food and recipes as they did into making the place look so fancy inside. The place delivers in atmospherics, but not in service or food freshness, quality or taste. I walked in around 10:00 pm so let's blame it all on it was late and the food wasn't at its freshest or best tasting.

The sweet and sour pork and the hot and sour soup both tasted as if they were about to go bad. More like bittersweet than sweet and sour. The complementary rice crisps were the best tasting item on the table. It was an interesting experience, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return here."
ChIJMWnaLKgoQg0RFrga94aFunI,5,"Nice
Is a very acceptable Chinese food in Madrid
Well recommended"
ChIJMWnaLKgoQg0RFrga94aFunI,5,Very nice and authentic Chinese restaurant. The decorations so China like. Spacious too. The food is delicious and great. Many choices. The owner and staffs very friendly. Location is good and ample parking. Will be back
ChIJMWnaLKgoQg0RFrga94aFunI,5,I had a lunch there for less than ‚Ç¨12 and that was very tasty. The service was great and the menu seems to be huge in general. Definitely worth coming back.
ChIJMWnaLKgoQg0RFrga94aFunI,2,"I could not get a ‚Äúmenu del dia‚Äù as there was no vegan option. So I ended up taking a miso soup, which was alright, and I asked for the mapo tofu (without meat), which was average and not done with sichuan pepper, rice, and a soft drink.
It cost me 18‚Ç¨.. While the lunch menu is 11‚Ç¨, and the main dishes where more expensive than the mapo tofu and yet they didn‚Äôt want to make me a menu price. That‚Äôs 7 ‚Ç¨ difference, without even having dessert. I definitely not recommended for vegans and vegetarians. Too expensive for the quality offered."
ChIJn9e6A_8lQg0RugLxxmpYPGY,5,"Try the sandwichs! They are awesome and include just made french fries! To die for

I had the cheese ham and egg
My husband had the chicken one and bothe were delicious

Kobe hamburger is super as well specially the bread they use

100% recommended"
ChIJn9e6A_8lQg0RugLxxmpYPGY,5,Unbeatable location in relation to the nearby public service offices
ChIJn9e6A_8lQg0RugLxxmpYPGY,4,Cafeteria
ChIJn9e6A_8lQg0RugLxxmpYPGY,2,√ü
ChIJn9e6A_8lQg0RugLxxmpYPGY,2,"The tapas are delicious but the attention of the waitresses is terrible, they serve you with a bad face and throw the plates at you, it is a shame that being a Gambrinus the staff acts in such a way (I speak for the girls with red hair because the brunette is very attentive) I hoped they take this into account to perhaps return."
ChIJbYaCJaYoQg0Ru-fiagC6nBg,5,"Best homemade pizza near retiro, great prices and offers , super easy to take out or delivery! Highly recommended!"
ChIJbYaCJaYoQg0Ru-fiagC6nBg,5,Good pizza
ChIJbYaCJaYoQg0Ru-fiagC6nBg,4,"These pizzas are really good. I usually order them often. However, the last one I ordered arrived charred. I had to call and the girl who helped me, despite telling me that she had not seen any pizza come out burnt, suggested sending me another one. This is the first time this has happened."
ChIJbYaCJaYoQg0Ru-fiagC6nBg,5,"Great picnic-pizza plan at the retreat.
Local delivery/pick up. It doesn't have tables.
We ate them at the retreat which is a 5 minute walk away.

Homemade pizzas with quality and original products... VERY VERY good.

ChIJbYaCJaYoQg0Ru-fiagC6nBg,1,We ordered the pizza through JustEat. On a Monday at 8:55 p.m. It took them 1h30m to deliver a burnt pizza. We had to have something else for dinner. The only thing they offered afterwards was to send another pizza at 11:30 p.m. when we had already had something else for dinner.
ChIJJ-AJIKkoQg0RRRehYI3LM-Q,2,Was okay. Eggs over done. Fries soaked in grease. Green peppers lacked salt. The shrimp on the toast with shrimp was extremely tiny. Staff was nice though
ChIJJ-AJIKkoQg0RRRehYI3LM-Q,4,I just had a coffee but the waiter was welcoming and nice
ChIJJ-AJIKkoQg0RRRehYI3LM-Q,5,Great place great staff very generous with the tapas. You won't be disappointed.

ChIJlfPluP4lQg0RxgiWbO8mFwI,5,"I tried the kebab at Ankhara Doner Kebab, and it was delicious! The meat was tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned, with just the right amount of char from the grill. The pita bread was soft and fresh, and it held the kebab and toppings together nicely. It came with a generous serving of crispy veggies and a creamy sauce that added a nice balance to the flavors.

Overall, a tasty and satisfying meal that I‚Äôd definitely recommend to anyone craving a good kebab. I‚Äôll be coming back for more!

Rating: 8/10"
ChIJlfPluP4lQg0RxgiWbO8mFwI,4,"Halal food was tasty. Cooking was nice but chicken a bit dry. Any way we really enjoyed the food. The tables were clean, and the TV was playing World War 2 film full of firing :) I think I ordered full chicken roast that comes with fries and drink and also ordered chicken wings with fries."
ChIJlfPluP4lQg0RxgiWbO8mFwI,5,"Great place, friendly staff and cheap prices."
ChIJlfPluP4lQg0RxgiWbO8mFwI,5,Such delicious food. Served by super friendly people in a pleasant shop. Absolutely worth a stop. A full meal cost me ‚Ç¨6.50.
ChIJlfPluP4lQg0RxgiWbO8mFwI,5,"The food was amazing and their staff were very friendly ,I prefer every one ."
ChIJH6rGiKgoQg0RmhkBSgQtN4U,5,"If you are looking for typical Spanish bar - highly recommend!
Huevos fritos, tortilla for breakfast and flan or natillas for dessert :)"
ChIJH6rGiKgoQg0RmhkBSgQtN4U,5,"I love to recommend navajas. It is a great and refined seefood dish. Together with the ensalata and a pincho tortilla, it is a great meal for two! The tortilla tasted marvelous too! Quality, klaro qu√© si!"
ChIJH6rGiKgoQg0RmhkBSgQtN4U,5,"I have tried multiple dishes at this restaurant, and I must say that both the quantity and quality are exceptional. It's quite rare to find such a combination in Madrid. Each dish is generously portioned, easily serving two people. I highly recommend trying the Salachipas, Calamares sandwich, Chopitos frito, Chistorra con patatas y huevos, fillet de ternera, and Pincho de Tortilla. They are all absolutely delicious!"
ChIJH6rGiKgoQg0RmhkBSgQtN4U,5,Very friendly waiter. English better than most. Good traditional Spanish food with standard to unique dishes
ChIJH6rGiKgoQg0RmhkBSgQtN4U,1,"Expensive and extremely slow service. Four waitresses to serve about 15 tables yet they needed 30+ minutes to take our order and another 30 to bring the food. Almost ‚Ç¨30 for two cokes, some calamares and a salad. Best avoided!"
ChIJq9ND6_cnQg0RimpZyWmYp1E,4,Been a couple of times this week. Food is awesome. Servers are good and managed well with my lack of Spanish. Would recommend.
ChIJq9ND6_cnQg0RimpZyWmYp1E,5,"Great little sports bar with a good atmosphere and fantastic service.

Food was very good,(I ordered the Boston Burger) good menu choice and very good value, definitely worth a visit if in the Madrid area.  Provides a good option if eating or just going for drinks."
ChIJq9ND6_cnQg0RimpZyWmYp1E,5,"Great place, great food. Miguel Angel was the best!"
ChIJq9ND6_cnQg0RimpZyWmYp1E,5,"We had an amazing time here! Perfect place to watch a game with great drinks and even better food. The owners/staff were very welcoming & made us feel right at home. We will definitely be back soon!

Side note: try the chipotle wings, they are INCREDIBLE"
ChIJq9ND6_cnQg0RimpZyWmYp1E,5,"Food is amazing (Especially the Dogs) and service is great.
Always have the game on the big screen. Fun place to come and hang."
ChIJ64i4jgAnQg0RTNuiQbtrf6c,5,"During our recent business trip to Madrid, we had the pleasure of dining at La Vinatera Taberna, and it truly exceeded our expectations. From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, setting the stage for an unforgettable culinary experience.

One standout dish was the burrata salad which was not only absolutely delicious but beautifully presented on elegant plates. Each bite was a delightful blend of creamy and fresh flavors that left us raving about it long after the meal.

The anchovies with pepper were another highlight. They were expertly seasoned, resulting in a dish that was both simple and simply fantastic. And of course, the Iberico ham Bellota was top notch - rich in flavor and perfectly cured, it was a real treat for the palate.

What made our experience at La Vinatera Taberna even more memorable was the excellent customer service. Despite our limited Spanish, the staff was attentive and accommodating, ensuring we felt welcome and valued. Their willingness to assist us made our dining experience all the more enjoyable.

Overall, La Vinatera Taberna is a gem in Madrid, combining delicious food with outstanding service. We highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city, and we can‚Äôt wait to return on our next trip!

Bon App√©tit!"
ChIJ64i4jgAnQg0RTNuiQbtrf6c,5,"A hidden gem! Very friendly service and one of the best and delicious food in Madrid. Though it might be a bit complicated with English.

Kitchen opens at 20:00, but the place is open before, so you can start with some drinks before the dinner. They have great selection of wines.

Regarding the food: croquettes were the best I've tried so far. Pork secret was a big surprise ‚Äì way more better that I was expecting. And a beef entrecote was prepared just perfect.

If you want to have something really really good, visit La Vinatera for a dinner. I definitely will go there in the first turn my next time in Madrid."
ChIJ64i4jgAnQg0RTNuiQbtrf6c,5,"La Vinater√≠a is a standout in Madrid's dining scene, offering delicious dishes and a welcoming atmosphere. Their Zamburi√±as a la Plancha are perfectly grilled scallops with a delicate char and tender interior, bursting with natural sweetness. The Ensaladilla Rusa con Ventresca adds a luxurious touch to the classic potato salad, thanks to the rich tuna belly.

The friendly and attentive staff enhance the experience, making guests feel right at home. For anyone looking to enjoy authentic Spanish cuisine, La Vinater√≠a is a must-visit."
ChIJ64i4jgAnQg0RTNuiQbtrf6c,5,"We spent a wonderful time last on June 1st, and the owner gave us excellent entrances while the kitchen was opened. He cared and shared a very good recommendations to enjoy an excellent moment. Thank you for all."
ChIJ64i4jgAnQg0RTNuiQbtrf6c,5,It is a very nice restaurant. The staff were very friendly and polite. We liked everything we ordered and we definitely will visit again.

ChIJE9-EeQMmQg0Rxl44LGqliRo,5,Great place.
ChIJE9-EeQMmQg0Rxl44LGqliRo,5,The new coffee and menu offer is excellent üëåüèº 100% recommended!!
ChIJE9-EeQMmQg0Rxl44LGqliRo,5,"Today we tried the menu for ‚Ç¨11 and it was really delicious
In addition, the waiters were super efficient, attentive, fast... really. A 10 for this site! I recommend yes yes yes"
ChIJE9-EeQMmQg0Rxl44LGqliRo,5,"Be careful with the tortilla they make... it is spectacular, juicy and very very delicious, they gave me a very generous tortilla skewer. I repeat place and tortilla as soon as I am in the area. A 10 üòâ"
ChIJE9-EeQMmQg0Rxl44LGqliRo,2,"I was passing through to do some business and I had breakfast there. Unlike many other bars, they had lactose-free milk and the waitress gave me the coffee exactly as I asked for milk temperature and coffee quantity. The tomato bars were good. Breakfast ‚Ç¨2.10, I thought it was a pretty good price. They were also friendly upon entry and exit. It has a bar area and a separate area with tables to have a drink or eat. The place is cozy. The only drawback was the bathroom, small and old and not at all clean, it looked like it had been like this for days and the smell was a bit unpleasant. If the cleanliness of the bathroom improved they would earn a lot of points."
ChIJlR46S9snQg0R3qTeqPDBy8c,5,"Wonderful Italian restaurant in walking distance from El Retiro Park. Menu is plentifully and the quality is excellent.
Decoration is a an intersection of Spanish bodega and Milano trattoria.
The food would be equally appropriate in an upscale modern setting. Quality is that good.
Highly recommend."
ChIJlR46S9snQg0R3qTeqPDBy8c,5,"Fantastic experience.
From the moment I stepped in, it felt like Italy. Italian music, Italian speaking staff, and a serious Italian menu. Can't say too much. A picture is with 1000 words. 100% 5 star experience. Well done guys. Absolute MUST visit here. I even got an Amuse-Bouche. House wine was excellent. Enough said."
ChIJlR46S9snQg0R3qTeqPDBy8c,5,"The food is delicious and It's also a good option for delivery. At the restaurante, I ordered sea food risotto and for delivery pizza. Both good option. ACQUA became my 1st option for pizza in Madrid."
ChIJlR46S9snQg0R3qTeqPDBy8c,5,We were staying at a nearby hotel and found this on TripAdvisor. Loved the food and service. Very friendly staff. Dessert was awesome.
ChIJlR46S9snQg0R3qTeqPDBy8c,5,"Loved my pizza. It was Pizza Parmigiana, with mozzarella, sliced aubergines and Parmesan cheese. It was thin and very fine, and when I cut it and brought it to my mouth, it was the most delicious morsel I‚Äôve had in many years. And I love pizza! It sort of reminded me of the ‚ÄúRatatouille moment‚Äù in the movie.
My partner said the Taglioloni al Nero di sepia were clearly fresh pasta, tender and wonderful, and the sauce reminded him of the one we do at home.
The only thing I would improve is that the place where we sat did not make the most of the atmosphere of the place. I kept wanting to turn my chair to face the street and the nicely illuminated street half of the restaurant. Perhaps if they made the interior, the part near the kitchen where the table I sat at was, more like the rest of the restaurant, this little qualm would be eliminated."
ChIJNUZ33_4lQg0RXJgA2GEtSQA,4,"100 montaditos is always a nice cheap way to spend time with friends, and go to when it‚Äôs raining doing your vacation in Madrid. In other town like Almer√≠a, el Ejido, Gabo de Gata, it‚Äôs cheaper to get tapas, and more satisfying. ‚ÄúThis location‚Äù it‚Äôa small, but nice, if you eat outside there is a churro truck park right in front of it most of the time, you can get some churros and eat it there together with hour montaditos."
ChIJNUZ33_4lQg0RXJgA2GEtSQA,5,"I love the food and the variety of beer / wine.
It's close to the bus stop and the local supermarkets.
Amazing prices and great service!"
ChIJNUZ33_4lQg0RXJgA2GEtSQA,5,Excellent option for a short time hang out. Cold drinks and a variety of snack at great prices.
ChIJNUZ33_4lQg0RXJgA2GEtSQA,3,The food is great and I like the concept but the crowd at this location was mostly dozens of young kids so it was insufferably loud and food was slow.  Perhaps it was just an off night for them.
ChIJNUZ33_4lQg0RXJgA2GEtSQA,4,"Excelent choice for quick get togethers, specially on wednesdays at special prices."
ChIJZZnrU_AlQg0RRNwREbXE5R8,4,"We ordered 2 burgers with  fries,salad and beverages. Salad sauce was too salty but lettuce was fresh and the chicken pieces tasty.The burgers were good but the fries weren't what we hoped for."
ChIJZZnrU_AlQg0RRNwREbXE5R8,4,"Decent burgers and hot dogs. They have daily deals (much like ""menu del d√≠a"") that are worth checking out."
ChIJZZnrU_AlQg0RRNwREbXE5R8,5,"A great place to indulge yourself!
Amazing burgers and delicious desserts. You have to try the cherry cake!
Also the beer catalog is huge and curated.
The place is really clean and the service is thoughtful and pleasant.
I tried it on delivery before, with the best delivery I've ever had... And knew we had to try it in person. A great experience!"
ChIJZZnrU_AlQg0RRNwREbXE5R8,4,"The atmosphere is great very friendly staff and good setting. The service is fast and efficient and the drinks good. The brownie was nice, different to what I usually have but it was a good change. Very sweet and soft texture as a brownies should be with a chunk of chocolate. Ice cream, cannot go wrong with ice cream cold and soft with a delicate chocolate taste. The only bad thing was the burger. Now the beef was good cooked as requested and had a salty flavour, but was ruined by the lump of cheese that was smacked onto it. Feta is nice cheese but overwhelming in high quantities, I asked for a cheese burger not a feta burger. This also made it taste rather dry so a bit of sauce would not be missed here . Chips crunchy and flavoursome with a soft fluffy interior. Overall a good experience here good friendly staff background music and football."
ChIJZZnrU_AlQg0RRNwREbXE5R8,3,It's an all burger menu but there's a large choice. Very tasty and friendly staff. Outdoor dining is great but be prepared for noisy kids running around.
ChIJ28b2A_ElQg0Ra71av89aQhI,5,For young People. Good ambience. Drinks ultra cheap even for Madrid standards.
ChIJ28b2A_ElQg0Ra71av89aQhI,3,"Food is just ok. Nice terrace, plenty of people."
ChIJ28b2A_ElQg0Ra71av89aQhI,5,It's fantastic
ChIJ28b2A_ElQg0Ra71av89aQhI,1,"It has left me speechless..... Expensive beer, without a pinch. If you want tapas it goes separately for ‚Ç¨1 (olives, potatoes or crusts) but we go with the main course, frozen potatoes with jar sauce 6 turkeys, 8 frozen croquettes from Lidl 7 turkeys, pizzas the size of a hand and of mediocre quality 10 turkeys. But what is this? Shameful, my cousin makes that kitchen when she is 7 years old and has two liters of oil."
ChIJ28b2A_ElQg0Ra71av89aQhI,2,"This place is self-service. You have to go inside to the bar to order, and pay on the spot. (If you go with a large group of people, this is great because then you don't have to split the bill).

Bad? Zero appetizers and you have to pay ‚Ç¨1 for them.

I ordered the hamburger for dinner that has jam, and it didn't taste much (it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either). If I go back I think I would try the classic.

The waiters were friendly, except for a couple who didn't treat us very well."
ChIJvfu2VJclQg0RSeVHnkb0L6w,5,"Great value sushi, have been a client for 10 years!"

ChIJvfu2VJclQg0RSeVHnkb0L6w,5,"Everything is too rich! My favorite is the fried rice with shrimp, the rubber/wakame salad and the crazy dragon roll üòç. Excellent delivery, fast and everything arrives hot! I will repeat!"
ChIJvfu2VJclQg0RSeVHnkb0L6w,5,"It has three menus of the day to choose from. They serve you quickly and the food is very good. If you like shushi, one of the menus has it. They always give you a starter, which is delicious and a little bit spicy. If you go with someone else, I recommend ordering dishes and sharing, so you can try a little of everything. One of their best dishes is fried wamtun."
ChIJvfu2VJclQg0RSeVHnkb0L6w,5,"I ordered takeout.
Very good quality of fish, and very good price. To add a drawback, so they can improve that, the rice was a little dry.
I think it's one of the best shusis I've ordered lately (moderately priced)"
ChIJ_31N2f4lQg0ROdoJAExoxNU,5,Not a lot of people. Clean bathrooms. Tasty food
ChIJ_31N2f4lQg0ROdoJAExoxNU,1,"I ate in burger King Moratalaz with my son around 7pm,this is not pick hours but the food are totally rare,french fries are like you're eating a rubber, the wings is very strange or we can say it was burnt but cold..i ordered nuggets because this is my son favorite everytime we eat to this particular restaurant we use to order this but he didn't ate all but it was only six little nuggets..31/10/2017"
ChIJ_31N2f4lQg0ROdoJAExoxNU,2,The serving was very fast and the food not hot enough. Besides every time I ate there I ended up with diharee. The kitchen staff never uses gloves every time I went there no one used glove manipulating food.
ChIJ_31N2f4lQg0ROdoJAExoxNU,5,good
ChIJ_31N2f4lQg0ROdoJAExoxNU,2,"The board outside says they close at 00:00, I pulled to open the door last night and asked if it was still open, they said no. It was 23:36. I went to MD instead."
ChIJi3W-5fklQg0RwVnGwz5obAg,1,"It‚Äôs my 1st, and will be my last! Don‚Äôt buy your pizza & other food at this place, specially if you place your order on line via app #Glovo . They tell you you‚Äôre supposed to receive your pizza home between within 30-40 minutes, and in reality they take over TWO hours, yes, no joke: over two hours to deliver your order. And, in my case, it‚Äôs just 20 minutes walk away from my place! As it‚Äôs very cold outside, I didn‚Äôt walk to the restaurant and decided to place the order via Glovo. What a repentant, what a regret! And the not so good taste of the pizza, nor the fries, nor the chicken wings‚Ä¶ jaysus, it‚Äôs a no go! Also the pizza wasn‚Äôt even sliced, it was whole: I had to use my kitchen scissors to do it! I don‚Äôt recommend it! Avoid this place!"
ChIJi3W-5fklQg0RwVnGwz5obAg,4,I go here for the weekly special and its great!
ChIJi3W-5fklQg0RwVnGwz5obAg,3,"Tasty pizza, a lot of possible choices. Best fast food pizza restaurant in Madrid"
ChIJi3W-5fklQg0RwVnGwz5obAg,1,The pizza was totally different from what I saw in the menu
ChIJi3W-5fklQg0RwVnGwz5obAg,5,"The normal pizza was good. Very good and very friendly service. The place was clean and tidy, very pleasant to eat there. As in most fast food places, one person to do everything, however, even better than the food was the attention."
ChIJRXSAX_clQg0RHYwqawM6B5U,5,Very good local eatery. Even though the staff didn‚Äôt speak english we managed to communicate with the lovely lady and enjoyed our food! Very local and tasty.
ChIJRXSAX_clQg0RHYwqawM6B5U,5,"Fantastic pincho de tortilla ,one of the best I've ever tasted!"
ChIJRXSAX_clQg0RHYwqawM6B5U,5,Top
ChIJRXSAX_clQg0RHYwqawM6B5U,5,We went to have their famous omelette for breakfast (which had been recommended to me on many occasions) and the truth is that it is spectacular!! Without a doubt we will repeat. It's nice to have places like this to have breakfast in the neighborhood.
ChIJRXSAX_clQg0RHYwqawM6B5U,5,"Very nice people, the waitresses of 10 and Jose the owner, an excellent person and what is the subject, very delicious food, all the omelettes, surely one of the best in Madrid and I have eaten many and the torreznos are equally spectacular and the breakfasts are all very delicious."
ChIJOSxHtf4lQg0RChnI8-aaF4E,5,We were looked after very well and the food was great.
ChIJOSxHtf4lQg0RChnI8-aaF4E,4,"Waitress was attentive, food was good. Apple tart not very tasty and a bit pricey. Good value with the discount from el tenedor/the fork."
ChIJOSxHtf4lQg0RChnI8-aaF4E,5,"All wonderful. The quality, the served and the great experience. We will go back to dinner or lunch here. The wine is also great.
All delicious. Thanks."
ChIJOSxHtf4lQg0RChnI8-aaF4E,5,Best food in Madrid! Ask for croquetas and Arroz con bogavante!!! Delicious!! the owner is so nice and waiters are very polite! Reccomended 100%
ChIJOSxHtf4lQg0RChnI8-aaF4E,4,"We had a meal with a big group and they accommodated us, and while the food was not great the service was good and the company excellent"
ChIJB9bvXf4lQg0RVM3kLZTPLV0,5,"The best service I got. A nice place yo drink something and eat tapas after a football game in the Elipa. The lady's are really nice, and always offer good tapas. Nice bar"
ChIJB9bvXf4lQg0RVM3kLZTPLV0,4,Nice food
ChIJB9bvXf4lQg0RVM3kLZTPLV0,5,Super
ChIJB9bvXf4lQg0RVM3kLZTPLV0,1,"We have never had a complaint, but the last time we went in for a coffee, they served us and when we paid the guy told us that they closed at 4:00 p.m., it was 3:53 p.m. If he had told us before serving us we would have left. Some gentlemen came in right after and did the same thing to them, I think you have to let them know before paying and serving."
ChIJB9bvXf4lQg0RVM3kLZTPLV0,5,"A wonder. We have had family food at ""El Azoguejo"". Exceptional food (very good cheeks and entrec√¥te), perfect service, all facilities. We have been on the terrace and despite the fact that there have been some ""hot spots"" the atmosphere has been very pleasant.
I recommend it without a doubt."
ChIJ2yWGafwlQg0RNUHUrz96MvU,5,"Great service, cheap drinks coming along with tast tapas. As a bonus, they have late afternoon sun... Which is great when Madrid is not scorching hot ;)

Ps: you may or may not have to fight some birds off to protect your food"
ChIJ2yWGafwlQg0RNUHUrz96MvU,5,It's about the best bar around moratalaz. I only had a beer but they also have food.
ChIJ2yWGafwlQg0RNUHUrz96MvU,5,"Great place for ""tapas"". You buy your drinks and get lots of tapas for free. Excellent atmosphere."
ChIJ2yWGafwlQg0RNUHUrz96MvU,4,Ok
ChIJ2yWGafwlQg0RNUHUrz96MvU,5,"My favorite breakfast place, even though they have changed owners, it is still cozy and very quiet.
I have breakfast there sometimes alone or with my children. And have tapas afternoons with friends.
Everything is very delicious, it's worth it ü§≠
Tannia is very efficient, fast and friendly.
Dani is attentive and very kind.
And Antonio who is attentive to the minimum so that you are comfortable while you are in the premises.
They are all lovely, I will always repeat until they ban my entry hahaha"
ChIJJxQELLYlQg0RNpEYrt1yrmE,5,Really amazing food with amazing staff(specially Romina who was really kind)! Totally recommend that!
ChIJJxQELLYlQg0RNpEYrt1yrmE,4,"A very nice Chinese restaurant where they serve full plates of delicious meals. The menu is not costy as I thought. The drinks are sweeter, especially the jar of Sangria drink. Their dessert is top!

The place is a little crowded and it was difficult to pass in front or behind people eating. It's a big place but I think it will be better to create a bit more spaces between tables."
ChIJJxQELLYlQg0RNpEYrt1yrmE,5,"Food was very good. Enjoyed lemon chicken,  Tempura chicken with Thai sauce, and almond chicken.  Miso soup was good but hot and sour soup wasn't. Water was horribly priced at 5 euro each.  People were very nice and spoke many languages."
ChIJJxQELLYlQg0RNpEYrt1yrmE,5,"We really enjoyed both the service and the food.
The waiters were really kind and they prepared some dishes at the table."
ChIJJxQELLYlQg0RNpEYrt1yrmE,3,"Not one of the best Chinese restaurants I've eaten at, but neither was it one of the worst. Menu del dia is a good idea if youre there for lunch. Everything was good except the breaded shrimp I'd say - which consisted in just very few pieces of shrimp. Still not too bad overall."
ChIJ3YOkCgAlQg0RCYhq5JvjFZ8,4,"Restaurant is incredibly cool inside. Attention to detail top notch, without losing the authentic appeal. All the staff wer super friendly and really nice. Food was good but unfortunately there was only one vegetarian Ramen option. It was more like a noodle soop, tasted really good but nothing super special. Would have liked to see a vegetarian miso ramen as well. Owner was awesome and offered some shots at the end :) Highly recommend if you're eating meat/fish. As vegetarian it's quite limited."
ChIJ3YOkCgAlQg0RCYhq5JvjFZ8,5,"Thank you so much for the best food!
Good pasta for the ramen,the takoyaki is the best!the bean ice cream is sooooooo noiiiice!I love it!
Great ambiance and service from mommy Roma!up to the cook.I would also like to say thanks to the owner for fiving us free dessert!wowwwww!"
ChIJ3YOkCgAlQg0RCYhq5JvjFZ8,5,Wow! The ramen that I ordered was so delicious and it was one of the best ramens that I ever had!! Everything from the very kind staff to the restaurant atmosphere was amazing and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for an authentic meal!
ChIJ3YOkCgAlQg0RCYhq5JvjFZ8,5,"Food was amazing! Service excellent!

I had the Shoyu Ramen and it was really good!

Definitely I will recommend it!"
ChIJ3YOkCgAlQg0RCYhq5JvjFZ8,5,"Their menu is very various from a la carte, hotpot to bbq. Food also tastes very decent and the price is reasonable. The ramen and hotpot taste very good, not salty like any other ramen place. It‚Äôs very authentic."
ChIJZ9qc4_slQg0RVWCaFxzdhxY,5,Friendly staff and lovely food üòã
ChIJZ9qc4_slQg0RVWCaFxzdhxY,1,"I used to go to the terrace quite often with the family, mostly because I could bring my dog. I have to say that both the service and the portions are as normal as anywhere else. But from now on I'll go somewhere else where dogs are welcome."
ChIJZ9qc4_slQg0RVWCaFxzdhxY,2,"I will not return, except when they change their service attitude: We were a group of 15 co-workers and we booked with a deposit. We order, to reserve, of all the hypothetical group menus, 2 same menus and the rest, portions. They told us days later that it is not possible, that some will eat a menu, and others rations, from which they asked us to choose again, between meat and fish, but still, nothing. That is, let the waiter tell us what we eat. Even so, I decide to go to see my colleagues, since I don't see them every day, but rather busy. At this point, eating is almost secondary. Well, once everyone was prepared, 3 of us requested the wine list. We continue waiting for her a day later, because the slowness in bringing out the dishes (flat omelet, good sausages (thank goodness), and scrambled potatoes with eggs that taste like a burnt pan and not washed for a month, the height of laziness in the kitchen) we have to chase the waiter for the bread, more beers, more summer reds, that is, they passed on us. We had the time and ability to have drinks until the evening, but we lost the desire. We ordered coffee and it took another half hour, thank goodness we are good at talking about our things. The quality of the food does not exceed 4, the quantities are very fair, the eggplants are sweet but we don't know why, they should have cane honey, but there was nothing of that, other than seeds. We would have ordered menus of 65, but the portions were 28. We couldn't even order a steak to share as portions, but it wasn't possible. We wanted to order a reserva or reserva for 3, but nothing. What a pity, it will be another year, when they learn to serve customers, customers that are very easy to satisfy, not at all demanding. We already eat fries and eggs from the daily menu, better served than in a Moratalaz that I knew years ago. It took them a while to even ask for the bill, if we had made a sinpa, they wouldn't discover it until today."
ChIJZ9qc4_slQg0RVWCaFxzdhxY,5,"It is a place where we always go as a family. The portions are very rich. I love the grilled ear. The last time I was there, I ordered half a menu and the Roquefort sirloins were very delicious. Without a doubt, I want to return."
ChIJZ9qc4_slQg0RVWCaFxzdhxY,5,"A pleasure to visit this restaurant, very good atmosphere and a lot of cordiality, the truth is that it is a pleasure to be received so well, the food is very delicious, thank you very much"
ChIJ7afmp58lQg0R5VSe73wU35o,1,"Puking and vomiting all day after. Terrible choice while being on a trip, NEVER recommend. We got super pepperoni, Hawaiian and Carbonara. Typing from the toilet..."
ChIJ7afmp58lQg0R5VSe73wU35o,1,Hi..Uber charged me on my card and the delivery person who came to deliver named Olga said it‚Äôs a cash order and took 37euros‚Ä¶horrible experience..not expected from a brand like papa John‚Äôs..please reply back at the earliest and sort this issue
ChIJ7afmp58lQg0R5VSe73wU35o,5,Jeff crack
ChIJ7afmp58lQg0R5VSe73wU35o,3,First time to try their pizzaüòä
ChIJ7afmp58lQg0R5VSe73wU35o,5,"It's very good, I like the pizzas, they have natural tomato sauce, I like their sauces, it's very good. They have a children's menu and it is very good."
ChIJr-pMNu8lQg0RtGscVxMAsp8,4,"Familiar taste mostly, skip the mash and gravy though, the Spanish version is not what we are used to"
ChIJr-pMNu8lQg0RtGscVxMAsp8,4,"Great KFC, nice people and fast service"
ChIJr-pMNu8lQg0RtGscVxMAsp8,5,Riquisimoooo
ChIJr-pMNu8lQg0RtGscVxMAsp8,5,"Very good experience. On Saturday I placed an order online and everything arrived, quickly I recommend it at üíØ"
ChIJr-pMNu8lQg0RtGscVxMAsp8,5,"Very good attention. I love the place, it's always clean. It should be noted that the original parts are the best"
ChIJZe2hrRwlQg0RMxHNPyKewnk,2,"Order some noodles and some Meatballs in prepared dishes. He says he wanted to have it at the Bistro. They heated the food a little, they didn't have bread, when it is a service they provide for eating in the Bistro and it was 8:43 p.m. In the bakery, 50 meters away, there were a lot of loaves of bread, they could have bothered to look for one. Before, they would give you a plate, now, not even that. In the prepared dishes, the person who served me almost spared my life. I was mopping the floor and I arrived at that moment. His quite angry face.
Very badly."
ChIJZe2hrRwlQg0RMxHNPyKewnk,1,"Terrible treatment.
Of two glasses, both dirty, I ask them to change them and on top of that they make a bad face at me and change them in a bad manner.
He doesn't give us an appetizer like the rest of the people, and when we tell him so, he gives us 3 empanadas drier and harder than a stone that we couldn't even eat."
ChIJZe2hrRwlQg0RMxHNPyKewnk,5,"Very clean. Great variety of things and everything super delicious and well priced. My ideal place to snack when we go there, plus the portions are large."
ChIJZe2hrRwlQg0RMxHNPyKewnk,2,"Bacon sandwich completely empty as seen in the photo, they tell me that it only has one bacon fillet, what you see in the photo is a fillet and a half, so it has too much."
ChIJZe2hrRwlQg0RMxHNPyKewnk,2,Great variety to choose from and good prices. But the last time I went my toast didn't have tomato prepared on the same day because it tasted stale. Some of the women who serve should be friendlier since they are facing the public.
ChIJZRgJFwAlQg0Rs1DbfCa6Y6o,1,"Pretty bad sushi, it shows that the ingredients are not fresh. The grain of rice is barely distinguishable, it seems like you are putting a paste in your mouth. On the other hand, the noodles are refried with excess soy sauce, which is not recommended."
ChIJZRgJFwAlQg0Rs1DbfCa6Y6o,1,"Fish with a bad taste, very soggy, I had to stop eating halfway through for fear that it would make me sick. Zero recommended."
ChIJZRgJFwAlQg0Rs1DbfCa6Y6o,5,"I really like their food and they give it in quantity, although the best are the rolls"
ChIJZRgJFwAlQg0Rs1DbfCa6Y6o,5,
ChIJZRgJFwAlQg0Rs1DbfCa6Y6o,5,
ChIJ77QvLPUlQg0Rxf4BUSMR2tA,5,Good selection of beer in the fridge. The staff were great and made an effort to speak English with us.
ChIJ77QvLPUlQg0Rxf4BUSMR2tA,3,"Small range of beer.
I just arrived in madris.
Looking for a San Miguel.  Or mahou
Maybe a Corona  job luck
The Caesar Salad was good"
ChIJ77QvLPUlQg0Rxf4BUSMR2tA,5,I strongly reccomend this place! 100%
ChIJ77QvLPUlQg0Rxf4BUSMR2tA,5,"Five years coming to this bar. The staff, the menu and the TVs have changed. Friends, girlfriends, ex-girlfriends, mothers and even children have come. We have come in good times and bad. Tuesdays, Sundays and some occasional Wednesdays. In winter with stoves and in summer with iced coffee.

A neighborhood bar, with real people and taking care of what's important. Excellent, close and familiar service. A great genre and an unmatched atmosphere.

If you don't have a bar, this is yours. No visa is required and we can all be adopted children of Bar Moraima.

A ten in everything. Happy to be part of this."
ChIJ77QvLPUlQg0Rxf4BUSMR2tA,4,"We were there yesterday afternoon. Wines and tapas. Very good croquettes. The shrimp omelet was good and I expected the lacon hot, but it was good. The attention of the staff of 10. The space between tables is wide and appreciated. We will return"
ChIJ286-DPolQg0Rv872zg2ZAbs,5,Absolutely lovely. A true hidden gem! Family owned and most comforting home made food. Went for brunch and ended up having all kinds of wonderful foods. The scrambled eggs with onion and garlic are mind blowing. Also highly recommend arroz con Leche!
ChIJ286-DPolQg0Rv872zg2ZAbs,4,Very attentive personnel. Nice home style food
ChIJ286-DPolQg0Rv872zg2ZAbs,5,"Very good attention
Very fresh products of very good quality, very good cleaning, the taste of grandmother, you have it here all your life.
Congratulations"
ChIJ286-DPolQg0Rv872zg2ZAbs,4,"They recently told me that at La Alfarer√≠a they had changed owners or cooks and, unfortunately, it is no longer what it was, especially the migas that ""before"" were made for breakfast on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Well, last weekend the planets aligned, the goddess Fortune wanted me to be near the inn and I decided to check if the drop in quality was true. Well no. Far from having gotten worse, in my opinion, the crumbs were even better: softer and tastier, but with less oil; As always, it's a shame to add fried eggs to the dish. Now, there are some buts to be raised: very little chorizo, in terms of the portion itself, much less quantity than before and, damn: crumbs and a coffee ‚Ç¨6.25, which made me choke on the last spoonful.

I will return, it is worth it, but there are the buts..."
ChIJ286-DPolQg0Rv872zg2ZAbs,2,"It should be called ""la alfa-careria"", a 3-slice bacon montage like cigarette paper on a peak of bad bread (they could already put the bread from the bar for the montanas). ‚Ç¨6.10 in a working-class neighborhood like Moratalaz. The only saving grace is the waitress, very nice."
ChIJkcAcjs0lQg0R9_yMwB1wlXw,5,"Nice halal food. The food was very delicious, and the staff was very friendly. The price is very reasonable or maybe they did special hospitality and charged us very less. We ordered a lot of food with drinks and the bill was only Euro 20 (¬£17.17). The food was very tasty, and the quantity was a lot. One of the thing I miss of Madrid is Khan baba restaurant :)"
ChIJkcAcjs0lQg0R9_yMwB1wlXw,5,"Great , Halal food. The food was very delicious, and the staff was very friendly Especially Nassar Abbas. The price is very reasonable or maybe they did special hospitality and charged us very less. We ordered a lot of food with drinks. The food was very tasty, and the quantity was a lot. One of the thing I miss of Madrid is Khan baba restaurant :)"
ChIJkcAcjs0lQg0R9_yMwB1wlXw,5,"As a Turkish I can say it was very good quality, the people working there are extremely kind and friendly. For 5‚Ç¨ you can eat great durum. Price/quality is exclusive. Make sure to ask for extra onion because then it‚Äôs amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJkcAcjs0lQg0R9_yMwB1wlXw,3,"Meat was nice,the  bread was fresh,a little difficulty in finding it as it is surrounding by a few housing schemes."
ChIJkcAcjs0lQg0R9_yMwB1wlXw,5,Super
ChIJlbZZKvclQg0RfNXt8Ki8z94,5,Raquel thank you so much for your overwhelming service. We had signature pizzas of Lab84 -  Gamberi and Nolan 2024. We loved both.  Highly recommend to try.
ChIJlbZZKvclQg0RfNXt8Ki8z94,5,"We came to this pizza place bc it was close
To our Airbrb. It‚Äôs small and there was 8 of us and we wanted to sit inside bc of the July heat. They made it work and the pizza was awesome. We have 2 salads (caprese and tuna salad-both were delicious) and 5 pizza (3 cheese and 2 vegetarian) both were all devoured by 2 adults and 6 kids. They didn‚Äôt speak English but the cook did so he translated for us. Very simple place but a big taste! The pizza could feed 1 person. Excellent place!!"
ChIJlbZZKvclQg0RfNXt8Ki8z94,5,"They make really good pizzas. The owner is Italian and is dedicated to treating his customers well. The desserts are home made and not too sweet, which is a plus. Salads generous and fresh.
They have a covered terrace for the winter months, very little space inside. On a weekend, must reserve with some advance."
ChIJlbZZKvclQg0RfNXt8Ki8z94,5,Amazing pizza üòçüçï
ChIJlbZZKvclQg0RfNXt8Ki8z94,3,"It was fine. Good food,and decent price"
ChIJs7QOGFMnQg0Rytcqpu8ilus,5,"A place where tacos taste like tradition, live music surrounds you and the attention makes you feel at home. Each bite brings with it the authentic flavor of Mexico, accompanied by a warm and festive atmosphere. Ideal for those looking for more than just good food: an experience that is felt."
ChIJs7QOGFMnQg0Rytcqpu8ilus,5,Traditional and homemade flavors but with innovation in its exclusive GRILL! Delicious BLUE TORTILLAS and a GLUTEN-FREE menu for everyone to enjoy without exception! Spectacular sauces and attention of 10! Let yourself be recommended and you will enjoy it twice as much!  And be careful with the cocktails! üéâüéâüéâ
ChIJs7QOGFMnQg0Rytcqpu8ilus,5,"One of those places that leave you wanting to repeat. Delicious food, great service. I'll be back!"

We were served by a super friendly waiter.
üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
We allowed ourselves to recommend the dishes and everything was very delicious ü§§
The sauces we tried were good although very adapted to the Madrid palate, not very spicy, I missed some spicier sauces such as morita chile or chipotle. üòâ
The Michelada is not its strong point, but acceptable‚Ä¶ üòÖ
For dessert we had some wonderful margaritas, they prepare this cocktail very well"
ChIJs7QOGFMnQg0Rytcqpu8ilus,5,"Wonderful Mexican in the Estrella neighborhood, delicious homemade food that makes it unique, it is a delicious experience, almost the entire menu is gluten-free. I am 100% recommended for celiac disease. I love all their cocktails, especially the mango one. My favorite dishes are cochinita pibil, al pastor, cochinita quesadillas and of course the De Lote dessert, an incredible cake with ice cream and popcorn, it's quite a party... thank you guys, I really enjoy when I go. An endearing attention üòò"
ChIJH0AVvfYpQg0RcZExlkWnN5Y,4,"First experience picking up Too Good to Go food at this legendary swimming sports center. As a sports venue it is amazing. The food I collected was holy. An excellent cheesecake, as well as the mixed paella and the breaded steak"
ChIJH0AVvfYpQg0RcZExlkWnN5Y,1,"We ordered two hamburgers, the bread was frozen so it broke on its own, the frozen and cold meat was served with a plate of potatoes as an appetizer and they didn't even offer it to us. Based on our experience, we would not recommend dining here."
ChIJH0AVvfYpQg0RcZExlkWnN5Y,5,"We had dinner for six people with the special canoe salad, the burrata with dried tomatoes, the Iberian ham, the entrec√¥te and, for dessert, the chocolate-filled teque√±os, and everything was spectacular. The meat is clearly of top quality. The service is very friendly and the terrace is great. 100% recommended."

The food is delicious and not expensive at all.
The delicious cachopo."
ChIJsc6cWvslQg0RVUwTQ6Tg-9g,5,"Hemos comido el men√∫ del d√≠a, la comida casera de buena calidad, buena cantidad, bien cocinada y con muy buen sabor, la presentaci√≥n no muy cuidada, el sitio es un restaurante de pol√≠gono,  sin pretensiones pero la comida muy buena y cuidada que para nosotros es lo m√°s importante."
ChIJsc6cWvslQg0RVUwTQ6Tg-9g,4,"The menu was delicious, well cooked and everything homemade. The place is in a workshop square, but the food was worth it."

ChIJXZk-d54lQg0R_ZI4_D7voEE,5,"Quite cozy, very good service and quality"

ChIJedhDPponQg0RlxrfNII8imk,5,"Nice little restaurant. At first glance, it may does not seem like it but the food is very very delicious. If you decide to go there, don't forget to not consume anything a day prior to your visit, as it is so much that you won't be able to eat anything the following day neither. :)! (I am a brave eater) Service ist also very welcoming! Ambience feels like you are in Ecuador and not in Madrid. They could easily charge double the price and it would still be cheap!
5/5!!!"
ChIJedhDPponQg0RlxrfNII8imk,5,"Good value for money. The food is very good and serves large portions.
My family and I left satisfied"
ChIJedhDPponQg0RlxrfNII8imk,5,"Exquisite, the truth is that for a neighborhood bar the food has nothing to envy of the most prestigious restaurants. We ordered a house salad, a shrimp ceviche and an onion and the truth is that everything was delicious, the presentation was very well cared for, with details and the prices were more than reasonable. I recommend it."
ChIJedhDPponQg0RlxrfNII8imk,5,"The food is very tasty, the portions are very generous and they have quite a variety of dishes. Without a doubt a good option to try Ecuadorian food. The service is very friendly and they make sure you feel comfortable and enjoy the food. The place looks clean. Without a doubt it is highly recommended."
ChIJedhDPponQg0RlxrfNII8imk,5,"The attention of 10, and the very delicious food, above all makes you feel as if you were in Ecuador. I will return with more people. One hundred percent recommended and it is close to the Vallecas bridge metro or bus 8,113 and 141."
ChIJn5skEAgmQg0R6vWBxm_NGwk,5,RECOMMENDED 100% EVERYTHING VERY TASTY AND PLEASANT THE ATMOSPHERE VERY TASTY AND LARGE QUANTITY DISHES

ChIJhydy45AlQg0RZaxhYYgdiGM,5,"IF you want to eat authentic Venezuelan food this is the place. Of all the places in Madrid where I have eaten Venezuelan food, Delicatessen Sohe Internacional S.L is the most authentic to our traditional flavors.
Don't hesitate, go and you will corroborate it.
Success guys, you have the greatest potential of our traditional and true Venezuelan food."
ChIJhydy45AlQg0RZaxhYYgdiGM,5,"The food is very delicious, they have good prices, the staff is very attentive and nice, the sauces are delicious and everything is very good!! it really is a very good place"
ChIJhydy45AlQg0RZaxhYYgdiGM,5,"Very good place to eat quality and service 100 out of 100, the taste of the food very very good recommended to everyone good prices and service. The attention of Ram√≥n and Nereida is excellent, without a doubt, the best place for Venezuelan food that I have eaten in Madrid."
ChIJhydy45AlQg0RZaxhYYgdiGM,5,"Well, I'm telling you that you won't be able to eat one from the pavilion on your own. Quality, SIZE and price ratio is the best I have tried. Also try the seafood ones and the pastries ü§§"
ChIJhydy45AlQg0RZaxhYYgdiGM,5,Rich and abundant Venezuelan food. I love the pies and the cachapas! üòç
ChIJFZrH3PcnQg0RnY3JCkL__tQ,5,"I've only ordered delivery and it seems like the best focaccia I've had in a long time: the ""fluffy"" nature of the focaccia, the delicious flavor of each ingredient: the mortadella with truffle, the tomatoes... it's an explosion of flavors!"
ChIJFZrH3PcnQg0RnY3JCkL__tQ,5,"I ordered delivery with Uber eats.
Zia Antonieta was her name, generous portion and above all very very delicious.

Plus point that despite being more than 3km from home, it arrived hot and not chewy. So highly recommended"
ChIJFZrH3PcnQg0RnY3JCkL__tQ,5,Finally ‚Äúla Parigina‚Äù in Madrid. Very good dough and raw material. We will be back soon.
ChIJFZrH3PcnQg0RnY3JCkL__tQ,5,"We were looking for a place in the area and luckily we found this restaurant a little hidden in the star market, the best focaccias we have tried and the incredible service, all super friendly, to give you a recommendation, Nonna Franka is incredible and not too itchy. Highly recommended for us, it is already a trusted site."
ChIJFZrH3PcnQg0RnY3JCkL__tQ,5,"Delicious focaccia, one of the best I've ever had and close to my house! Wowwww!"
ChIJUZ5KtzonQg0RNN2FTV-jFXM,5,Came in for tapas on a beautiful day. We were looking for outdoor seating. At first glance the tables in the middle of the courtyard didn‚Äôt seem like a great ambiance but it came recommended by our hotel and it did not disappoint. The food was amazing and service was fast. Would come again!
ChIJUZ5KtzonQg0RNN2FTV-jFXM,5,"AMAZING! I didn‚Äôt expect to find this jewel in a typical neighborhood in Madrid. I am vegetarian and was a visiting a very carnivorous friend and there were plenty of options for both of us. I‚Äôm a craft beer drinker and he likes spirits and we both were super satisfied. The staff was super friendly, patient, and helpful. (The owner Jose was sooo nice and respectful of my needs.) Prices were comparable for the area but the quality of food was better. If we visit this area again, we will definitely be back!"
ChIJUZ5KtzonQg0RNN2FTV-jFXM,5,"Great choice!!! Absolutely delicious food!!! Great hospitality and the staff was very helpful, even though they don't speak English we manage to order everything. You should visit it!!!"
ChIJUZ5KtzonQg0RNN2FTV-jFXM,1,Incorrect open times in Google
ChIJUZ5KtzonQg0RNN2FTV-jFXM,5,"An unforgettable experience in Rinc√≥n del Conde! This place has a special charm and the attention of the waiters is simply spectacular, always attentive and friendly. We ordered a grilled emperor from the menu, generous and delicious, cooked to perfection. I opted for the menu: first, a paella with bomb rice that was finger-licking good, and second, a tender and flavorful cider chicken. We accompany everything with a Toro Piedra Lagarona wine, a true pleasure for the senses. Without a doubt, a place to repeat. Highly recommended!"

ChIJFcjwMgImQg0RMiJ7pnHul6c,5,The staff are very helpful! Highly recommended
ChIJFcjwMgImQg0RMiJ7pnHul6c,5,I can only say good things about both Fredi and the business. I have known Fredi for many years. As a person he is exceptional and it shows in the closeness and treatment with which he treats you. The business is run with great care and all the product it has is of superior quality. He advises you and advises you on what you can take and what you can't. He is a great person and a great professional.
ChIJFcjwMgImQg0RMiJ7pnHul6c,5,Very good quality and treatment
ChIJFcjwMgImQg0RMiJ7pnHul6c,5,Excellent service. 100% quality
ChIJ42eYMQImQg0RJsp4N3FDqFU,5,I really like your products! There is a great variety not only in chicken but also in sauces and preparations for chicken.
ChIJ42eYMQImQg0RJsp4N3FDqFU,5,Good professionals. Good genre. Good deal. Good experience going there. 100% recommended
ChIJ42eYMQImQg0RJsp4N3FDqFU,5,"It is worth it just for the kindness with which they always serve you, but they also have a product of unbeatable quality that they always prepare according to your needs."
ChIJ42eYMQImQg0RJsp4N3FDqFU,5,"Not only do they have very good gender, but they are beautiful people!
best in the gallery!"
ChIJ42eYMQImQg0RJsp4N3FDqFU,5,It's a pleasure to see them working on gender and dealing with neighborhood clients. They have an excellent product and unbeatable service. Going to the market to see Luis is going home with a smile and a product that has nothing to do with the prepared trays at the supermarket and at a very similar price. 100% recommended
ChIJ--1GM-QnQg0RUorff7LPyFY,5,Probably the best food I have eaten in 3 weeks in Spain. Cannot complain at all and they were super nice and attentive. The Mixed Paella was amazing and the pork belly super tasty. Excellent staff!!
ChIJ--1GM-QnQg0RUorff7LPyFY,4,"Amazing food, great service and a toilet like a train station McDonalds. Small tweak would make this place perfect."
ChIJ--1GM-QnQg0RUorff7LPyFY,5,"Across the street from Voco hotel. The food and the service is amazing! Had the Ox Tails, delicious!"
ChIJ--1GM-QnQg0RUorff7LPyFY,5,"We traveled from US, Paris then Madrid. We walked around the hotel in the morning for coffee. We found this restaurant on the way. One of staff saw us wondering around flipping their menu :). He helped us with Cafe con Leche and told us that we can sit anywhere. Another lady staff came with hot coffee with milk. We really love the coffee and obviously their exceptional service. We don‚Äôt speak Spanish. However, both staffs were able to communicate with us in English.

We then ordered two more items for breakfast. They are delicious. We plan to visit this place for dinner and breakfast for our remaining stay in Madrid.

The price is very affordable and they do accept credit card and Apple Pay.

I highly recommend.

Thank you
Dr. Niwech de Madrid"
ChIJ--1GM-QnQg0RUorff7LPyFY,5,"Excellent service and great food...prices, in addition,  were reasonable. Very busy this evening both both waiters coped brilliantly.   Top Marks"
ChIJset5QiomQg0RCWIbmvAg-J8,4,"This restaurant is situated in Casa de campo (near metro Lago).  A nice outdoor place with a beautiful view of the lake and a pleasant atmosphere in summer days. The staff was attentive and friendly and the service was quiet  fast.
The dishes were delicious and I‚Äôd recommend the traditional Spanish dishes such as calamari, Lac√≥n (pork), Spanish omelette and typical Galician style octopus dish as starters.  For the main dish we‚Äôd rice with scarlet shrimps.
For desserts we had cheese & chocolate cakes which were awesome. They served us liquor shots on the house.
I‚Äôd recommend this place to all types occasions for families, friends and groups."
ChIJset5QiomQg0RCWIbmvAg-J8,5,"We planned to stop for a drink and saw the food being served. We wanted to try braai our own meat at the table, and it was a very fun experience. The service was very good and would recommend this place and go back."
ChIJset5QiomQg0RCWIbmvAg-J8,5,Amazing outdoor restaurant. The staff is super friendly and the tapas were delicious! The owner wanted us to try his wine and brought us extra dishes to try.
ChIJset5QiomQg0RCWIbmvAg-J8,4,"It is a big restaurant but only have 1 toilet for all the customers. Bystanders also cue for the toilets, it was a nightmare! So you can spend around 20 minutes waiting for your turn. Place is gorgeous, although the waitress have no experience what so ever, and they ask us for the bill, already paid few times."
ChIJset5QiomQg0RCWIbmvAg-J8,5,"Best service you can imagine in a lovely setting. The waiter, Vicente, was so attentive we'll sure be back. Perfect place for a summer date night."
ChIJr8CDuwUoQg0Ro6nUFZ2jwYE,3,Not great service. Other people who arrived later without a booking were sat before us. Food was yummy. Asked for a refill of wine but never came. Asked for the bill three times and ended up waiting 20 minutes. Overall not the best experience. Good views.
ChIJr8CDuwUoQg0Ro6nUFZ2jwYE,5,Excellent food - nice ambience with river on the side. Well recommended place!!
ChIJr8CDuwUoQg0Ro6nUFZ2jwYE,5,Beautiful area and the restaurant offers outdoor sitting and it was perfect. The food was amazing. Highly recommended.
ChIJr8CDuwUoQg0Ro6nUFZ2jwYE,2,"We sat down at a table outside, and their first sentence instead of greeting us was an unfriendly yell, that we should wait by the door to be seated. There was no sign which would indicate this. To the best of our knowledge, it is not a common practice in this country, hence our surprise.

So we stood up, went to the door and waited for the waiter to accompany us to the exact same spot.

We got no menu, offers or anything. Of course we came for a coffee, but we would have been happy to order something sweet.

The coffee was expensive, low quality and served with an attitude. The mug was dirty and the waiter spilled the milk all over the side of the mug and the saucer.

I understand that we are not high paying customers, but this is no reason to be that rude. The restaurant wasn't even full, so we weren't taking up the place from anyone. We just wanted to enjoy a nice cup of coffee with a slice of cake by the lake. We should have made a takeaway at home."
ChIJr8CDuwUoQg0Ro6nUFZ2jwYE,5,"This is such a great place by the lake, really beautiful and authentic. Went there with a couple of friends and we ate almost every vegan plate they had on the menu. I strongly recommend the grilled artichokes and the rice, that was some kind of vegetable paella that was amazing. Definitely going back!"
ChIJa65_X2QpQg0RT16RbGVpT4s,5,"A no frills place right by the lake. Very nice service, polite to foreigners, and good food! They have a menu del dia they let you share. I always come here when I eat by the lake."
ChIJa65_X2QpQg0RT16RbGVpT4s,5,"Had a lunch at this place and decided to celebrate my wedding here.
Wonderful place with a great view, very friendly and attentive staff and lovely food. Plenty of space and super nice atmosphere.

Tried a bunch of things from their menu, and honestly, loved everything.

Thank you guys for making our special day even more special"
ChIJa65_X2QpQg0RT16RbGVpT4s,5,"We had a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner here with a large group of American students.  The decoration, quality of the food (delicious!), and the staff's attention to detail and professionalism made the experience very special and authentic.

The restaurant's glassed in patio with beautiful views of the Casa de Campo lake and Madrid skyline is another highlight of the dining experience."
ChIJa65_X2QpQg0RT16RbGVpT4s,5,Not only was the food excellent but the staff was incredibly nice and entertaining. And a wonderful view on a wonderful day.
ChIJa65_X2QpQg0RT16RbGVpT4s,5,"Great food and atmosphere. The waiters were very friendly, especially Karla and Adri√°n. Highly recommended!"
ChIJw5xbe4QpQg0RxKFhbDI9wOY,5,"We went to see Casa de Campo without a plan as to where to eat. We went to La Taberna El Urogallo as we felt it was for us. We sat outside and enjoyed the great views, the birds, outstanding service and most importantly the food. The waiter immediately brought us a complimentary plate heaped with a salad of potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, tuna and olive oil. It was so good that we decided to add it to our menu the next time we entertain our friends. I had the Pulpito a la Parilla, the most tender, tasty octopus I have had here in our month in Madrid. My partner had the Lubina a la Espalda, very fresh and flavourful accompanied with great tasting sliced / lightly fried potatoes. The whole sea bass had been halved and the bones removed, nice touch! Thanks to Oscar and the staff for a great, memorable meal!"
ChIJw5xbe4QpQg0RxKFhbDI9wOY,1,Good service. Discreet food. Very good location. Exorbitant prices. It doesn't make any sense. I leave you the photo of the ticket and you gotea add 10% VAT.
ChIJw5xbe4QpQg0RxKFhbDI9wOY,2,"I really wanted to like this place. It belongs to the Urogallo owner next door, sadly it does not have the same level. A little over priced. We had Octopus which was‚Äùok‚Äù a little hard and chewy, razor clams a little sand but tasty, and a sea bass Lunina that sadly was not done well it was undercooked, as mentioned I would pass to repeat and would not recommend sadly, I really wanted to like it but will stick to the other one the Urogallo. By the way seating arrangements are 100% terrible the hostess has not a clue and is overwhelmed by any number of guests. So sad"
ChIJw5xbe4QpQg0RxKFhbDI9wOY,5,"After walking to the Casa de Campo from the Royal Palace, we decided to eat here because of the attractive outdoor seating and the men√∫ del d√≠a posted at the entrance. Although neither the hostess nor our waiter spoke much English, we managed just fine, and thought we received excellent, friendly service.

We were overwhelmed with the choices available on the men√∫, and were literally amazed by the large portions served with each course. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious!

Our expectations were far exceeded. This turned out to be the most memorable and enjoyable meal of our entire Spain trip, and we've been reminiscing about it ever since."
ChIJw5xbe4QpQg0RxKFhbDI9wOY,4,"Visited for dinner on a midweek night so wasn't busy at all.  As such, the atmosphere was a little lacking. However, the view over the city and the quality of the food (in particular the 'solomillo') was more than fair recompense."
ChIJNZuYanMpQg0RCVI3aV2GvJc,5,"Wonderful cozy restaurant. Beautiful atmosphere, incredible food. Christian was a perfect waiter, personable, and took care of things."
ChIJNZuYanMpQg0RCVI3aV2GvJc,2,"Absolute terrible service, we had to ask/remind to bring our drinks and food several (more then 5) times. Plus, they kept forgetting orders. Overall, we waited 1,5 hours for our food to arrive and drinks had to be reminded constantly. We never received any apology or compensation. Most of the other tables had the same problem and were getting frustrated, creating a negative atmosphere across the terrace. The food is good but pricey, which would be justified if you can enjoy good service. I would not recommend this place, they used to be good. Not sure what happened management wise."
ChIJNZuYanMpQg0RCVI3aV2GvJc,5,"What a great spot by the lake. The food was great, service good and would definitely return to enjoy the terrace outside. Recommend: steak tartare & the cheesecake."
ChIJNZuYanMpQg0RCVI3aV2GvJc,5,"Superb atmosphere with romantic lighting and lake views.  The service was extraordinary.  Christian was the best!  He helped us, even though our Spanish was terrible.  Ask for the Caipirinha cocktails!"
ChIJNZuYanMpQg0RCVI3aV2GvJc,5,This is my third time coming back and the food was good! The pulpo was tender and the entre√±as was flavourful. The staff are friendly and very accommodating too!
ChIJI7MQNxwpQg0RuSFEgNQ2g8s,5,Very chill spot on the lake. Cold beer and good food. Relaxing atmosphere. Beautiful view. The Burgers are awesome. I love how you get chips and olives with your glass of beer.
ChIJI7MQNxwpQg0RuSFEgNQ2g8s,5,"Didn‚Äôt end up sitting at the cafe but on a bench nearby, next to the water. Recommend visiting a little before sunset. You can also feed the ducks!
Also! Take a walk around the lake, through the ‚Äúwoodsy part‚Äù!"
ChIJI7MQNxwpQg0RuSFEgNQ2g8s,4,"The portion of food was huge. Even the food from children menu. I hate to waste food, but I have never seen that much of spaghetti in my life before. I hope the management could consider about this matter. Anyway, the waitress was very lovely, I ordered food for myself and my kids first, while my husband was still on his way to the restaurant. When my kids almost finished their starter, I ordered the steak. The waitress found her manager told me that the steak was too much for me, I then explained that the steak was for my husband. Then they said it‚Äôs ok for a man. But, the moment we saw the steak, I knew my husband couldn‚Äôt finish the whole thing. It‚Äôs big enough for two men. Overall, whole meal was quite expensive, and it‚Äôs shame we didn‚Äôt enjoyed them that much."
ChIJI7MQNxwpQg0RuSFEgNQ2g8s,5,"Very good menu! This restaurant has a very nice view. The waiters are very friendly, they didn't force me to pay and leave the place for other customers after I was done eatung. I could stay there and enjoy the day for another drink! The fish had a few bones but that was ok. Prices are fair, 16.50‚Ç¨ for the menu!"
ChIJI7MQNxwpQg0RuSFEgNQ2g8s,2,"It was a shame because the place is great near the casa de campo's lake, and the terrace was also very nice. However the service was incredibly bad. We order menu for all of us, 9 people, and we had to ask for the second dish and complain in order to get the desert. As per them, they were short on people, but it was obvious that they don't have any kind of organizational skills to serve the tables. I don't specially complain of this kind of things if this is not extremely annoying.
Food was only ok. I order a salad as first, that was mainly sauce with pineapple and lettuce, and got a very small portion of fish as my second. In short, I'm not sure whether I would try again. :("
ChIJS8ropk8pQg0Rho-ud6qVnZs,5,"It is difficult to find a place in Madrid where the service and food are still 10 at a reasonable price. Don't be fooled by the name because the food is Mediterranean with incredible quality. The treatment of Paco the person in charge of the room, Sergio as a technician and Daniel as waiters make the difference for 10. We will hold an event there again"
ChIJS8ropk8pQg0Rho-ud6qVnZs,5,"We have been coworkers with our respective families and we have had a great time. We ate late, but then we were able to have a drink with music and then a live performance.
Great attention. The truth! What will we repeat"
ChIJS8ropk8pQg0Rho-ud6qVnZs,1,"Hello, I am a regular at the Friday dance session and I would like to explain that since the strong storm in Madrid, the bathrooms have not been closed due to an incident but......an incident that the clients have been suffering for a month, having to go down to the ground floors, please ask the person in charge in this respect that we are owed respect and conditions and I understand the breakdown but I also understand that with a little effort those bathrooms could be fixed, and well, the owner of the establishment would also like to explain to me why he offers a non-alcoholic beer an increase of 2 euros when I already Page for the entrance and two beers 12.60 euros which does not specify the increase and I would not even understand that a non-alcoholic beer was called a special checkered beer, I stayed, otherwise the people at the cashier, bar and organizers of the event are charming, congratulations from me! Thank you"
ChIJS8ropk8pQg0Rho-ud6qVnZs,1,"We knew the place when it was the superbrewery and we wanted to see the change, the food was scarce, poorly prepared, very expensive prices and poor quality, the dance area upstairs was very normal and the one downstairs was a private party, I'm not sorry but we will not return"
ChIJS8ropk8pQg0Rho-ud6qVnZs,5,"I felt very good. Your coordinator, Paco, is a star. Jos√© Talero's team is an Ace, and the attention of the staff, I quote Sergio, sound technician. I say this not only personally, but for more than 150 diners at yesterday's dinner."
ChIJq_8apB8pQg0R6JD8kIPSq7k,5,"Wanted takeaway pizza and papIzas opposite was somehow closed mid day. Hopped over to madre mia and the pizzas tasted superb! There were some communication issues as they did not speak English at all, but the lady was very friendly and patient. Thank you!"
ChIJq_8apB8pQg0R6JD8kIPSq7k,5,great food and amazing show to watch while you are having a dinner or drinks with friends! i totally recommend! i loved tonight and i will be back for sure ! well done Carmen ‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüèΩ
ChIJq_8apB8pQg0R6JD8kIPSq7k,5,"Good place to have dinner, but aldo have fun, It was very good remember music dj and they also have a discotec on the underground floor"
ChIJq_8apB8pQg0R6JD8kIPSq7k,4,I went for the end of the year party. It was ok.
ChIJq_8apB8pQg0R6JD8kIPSq7k,5,"First time visiting, fantastic venue, all the staff were fantastic!! Thank you for a great Saturday lunch!! Gracias todos"
ChIJY3KimqApQg0RyW_rQcTSTkc,1,Terrible.
ChIJY3KimqApQg0RyW_rQcTSTkc,5,"It is certainly different, this restaurant has brought the show to the table, the two artists, she and him, make the evening interactive and different, everything happens between songs and dances between the tables, they are fantastic, and the waitress is super familiar, giving a warm touch to the room. I recommend the tacos and the grilled octopus, they are exquisite, but apparently the meat and rice are their specialty. The place has a separate dance room for afterwards, there I saw a good level of salsa. They introduced me to the director of the establishment, a somewhat serious man but with a good heart, thank you all for the details during dinner. An unforgettable night.
PS: the placement of the table, its tablecloths and the treatment of the waiters is wonderful."
ChIJY3KimqApQg0RyW_rQcTSTkc,5,"Spectacular site! The food is very very good, the dishes are abundant. The service is the best I have ever seen. Mara, the waitress, is exceptional, attentive at all times to all the diners. Don't trust bad reviews, they are before the new team that has it. 100x100 recommended!! We will be back!!!"
ChIJY3KimqApQg0RyW_rQcTSTkc,3,"We ate a correct ceviche, a combo of various starters that could be a little more original, and a Colombian snack with the meat either very dry or very fatty. The dessert, a crispy puff pastry millefeuille that we liked for not being cloying at all and for its citrus touch. The service was very attentive."
ChIJY3KimqApQg0RyW_rQcTSTkc,4,"A very nice place. The waiters took a long time to serve you. While dinner there was karaoke and if you go with friends it can be fun but as a couple we could hardly even talk about the music being so loud. Then if you want to dance, you can go upstairs and it's very good, they let us go up with the dinner ticket. The manager came to tell us that they no longer had the fork discount, but when he showed me my reservation he did it for us and was very kind, even though they say it was an error in the application.  The food was very delicious and generous portions, although the dessert was very expensive for the ‚Ç¨9 it cost."
ChIJ3dWZ9e2NQQ0RmOfouhh9494,5,"Great food, I had the barbacue wings combo with plantain. The wings were tasty and had big pieces and the plantain was nice and crispy. It was delicious & would definitely order again! Would recommend this place."
ChIJ3dWZ9e2NQQ0RmOfouhh9494,5,"Outstanding food and service, definitely we will be coming back ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJ3dWZ9e2NQQ0RmOfouhh9494,5,Best wings i had in a long time! Quality food and the attention from the staff is worth more than 5 stars.
ChIJ3dWZ9e2NQQ0RmOfouhh9494,5,"Great food, awesome and super friendly service!!!"
ChIJ3dWZ9e2NQQ0RmOfouhh9494,5,Great service and chickens wings
ChIJp60-k4EpQg0RO3ryB1IIUXc,5,"Clearly don't go there expecting incredible food
Good there for the atmosphere
Service very fast
Waiters (+chef) very friendly"
ChIJp60-k4EpQg0RO3ryB1IIUXc,5,"The best arepas in the world made by Pablo! Apart from being a good cook, he is a beautiful person and is always attentive to everything.
It is my trusted place for arepas, cake and smoothie. 10/10 ü§é"
ChIJp60-k4EpQg0RO3ryB1IIUXc,5,"One of my favorite places in Madrid. The unbeatable treatment, the delicious food and at a good price. The best arepas in Madrid are here. It is my trusted site ‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you for everything!"
ChIJp60-k4EpQg0RO3ryB1IIUXc,5,Quiet and pleasant place. Economical menu and homemade food. The arepas they prepare for you are from my father and my lord. I will repeat without a doubt.
ChIJp60-k4EpQg0RO3ryB1IIUXc,5,"I went to this place located in the city of Madrid, where they have a small place near the Casa de Campo. This is an establishment specialized in Latin American cuisine, with a wide variety of savory products and some sweets to choose from. In my case I ordered a variety of products such as a teque√±o, an empanada, a stuffed potato, yucca and some more. The truth is they were quite good, the empanada with Colombian-type corn flour was very good, the teque√±o with good dough and good cheese, and the rest with correct batters and fillings with a lot of flavor that I loved. Everything had a price of about ‚Ç¨10.

Ôøº"
ChIJH1IwdnQpQg0RqqM884jrVCs,5,"Super delicious and varied empanadas, for all tastes, accompanied by very tasty sauces and at a ridiculous price. The man who attended us is charming, very nice and very good treatment. Additionally, you can pay by card, which is always a plus.

One hundred percent recommended!"
ChIJH1IwdnQpQg0RqqM884jrVCs,5,"I loved it, it is one of my favorite places to eat apart from the fact that the service is the best, the man who serves is very friendly, üíØ recommended."
ChIJH1IwdnQpQg0RqqM884jrVCs,5,"All the empanadas and desserts were delicious, in addition to the super friendly staff. Oh, and the price is also very good for the quality of the product. Highly recommended!!"
ChIJH1IwdnQpQg0RqqM884jrVCs,5,"Super friendly staff, and the delicacies and desserts are super delicious."
ChIJH1IwdnQpQg0RqqM884jrVCs,5,"100% recommended! Everything you order is great and the service is very pleasant, thank you!"
ChIJbw92Um0oQg0RRoMJW-8ZV5I,5,"Excellent, meaty dinner.
The place was recommended by our local friends so we had to try it even though it was a late start at 22:00.

The crab salad was a great appetizer though we came for the mains: the Ribs and the steak were just great. The Ribs portion is big and was shared (due to the time of night).
Service was fine. Unfortunately the level of English was not great, but we made it work and the guys served with a smile.
Thank you."
ChIJbw92Um0oQg0RRoMJW-8ZV5I,3,"The food is nice, but the staff can be rude to new undiscovered levels. They have set times per table which is fine but won't give you notice of how much time you have left though will happily take orders, take ages to serve you and then rush you to leave. Not recommended if you want a relaxed meal, but okay for a quick treat. Staff appalling"
ChIJbw92Um0oQg0RRoMJW-8ZV5I,5,"I am sorry, paella was eaten before the photo, because it was too good and it was complimentary surprisingly. The portions you see on the photo are small ones, Paella was served immediately and tasted unforgettable. I only played 29 euros, this place just don't deserve 4.2 it is way better than many 4.6 restaurants we tried in Madrid."
ChIJbw92Um0oQg0RRoMJW-8ZV5I,4,"Attentive and Friendly staff particularly Herman is very welcoming. Nice place and dishes are delicious.

They have good menu during the week. Keep in mind to book in advance otherwise it‚Äôs difficult to get a table sometimes particularly at weekends."
ChIJbw92Um0oQg0RRoMJW-8ZV5I,5,"I have always gone to the one in Casa Campo and this one is just as good. Great food always and the service is spot on.
Today I just had some red Ribera wines and some patatas dos salsas bravas and alioli always great a quick spot after work I had to blow an hour to charge the electric car and this made perfect sense.
Highly recommend this spot if you are in the area I admit it is not in the center of the tourist attractions but it is close to the cathedral and the subway."
ChIJo8V8lnIoQg0Rxtq9jI33bpE,4,"It‚Äôs one of the best in this area without any doubt though it‚Äôs a bit dear. It was during the week so it wasn‚Äôt busy. The staff was very attentive and service was fast.
They serve good snacks and sweets on the house. Good starters and delicious rice dish with seafood.
Great place for families and groups"
ChIJo8V8lnIoQg0Rxtq9jI33bpE,5,Excellent food and services. Having drinks and dinner there. Staff serving us are very nice and helpful.
ChIJo8V8lnIoQg0Rxtq9jI33bpE,4,"This is a nice traditional Spanish restaurant and such a great location to our hotel.
The food was tasty and plenty.
The service was great and the restaurant is well lit and spacious.
The best part was that they had English menus too!
This restaurant is worth paying the price for."
ChIJo8V8lnIoQg0Rxtq9jI33bpE,4,It‚Äôs a 4.5 star for me only because I think they should do renovations and revamp the place up. As for food I ordered the seafood and it was top notch. My partner ordered meat which was average.
ChIJo8V8lnIoQg0Rxtq9jI33bpE,5,Ate here several times and thoroughly enjoyed the food; paella or seafood were both excellent. Only note the restaurant opens at 8:30pm each night.
ChIJg9BxAhMoQg0RucLg0XEToGY,4,"We visited Casa Mingo and had a mixed experience. The ham platter wasn‚Äôt the best, and the bread was quite dry, but the roast chicken was absolutely incredible, definitely the highlight of the meal. The service was a bit slow, but nothing too frustrating. We also tried the natural cider, which was very nice and added a unique touch to the experience. Worth a visit, especially for the chicken!"
ChIJg9BxAhMoQg0RucLg0XEToGY,4,"I had the roasted chicken at Casa Mingo, and it was absolutely amazing. The chicken was perfectly cooked‚Äîcrispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It‚Äôs a simple dish but done exceptionally well. We truly enjoyed the meal and the cozy atmosphere. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for great food in Madrid!"
ChIJg9BxAhMoQg0RucLg0XEToGY,5,"Of all the restaurants I‚Äôve been to in Barcelona, Seville, and Madrid, I had the best experience at Casa Mingo.
- Our waiter, Alvaro, was incredibly friendly. He described the items we ordered and verified that everything was to our liking.
- The chicken was nothing short of perfection. Well-priced with a large enough serving for 2 people and incredibly flavorful. Would recommend 10/10.
- The cider was a great cultural experience. Alvaro showed us how to properly pour it ‚Äî high above your glass. You need to try it if you come here!"
ChIJg9BxAhMoQg0RucLg0XEToGY,4,"Although it seemed to be busy and we didn't have a reservation, we got a table within a 3 minutes.

My experience:

Very friendly staff,
Delicious food with a great taste,
Friendly employees and atmosphere,
Decent amount of food,
They don't serve fries but a bag of crisps/chips instead,
Can be a bit laud but that's okay,
It has an unique style,
The waiters service was good even though they forgot to give me a salad I ordered.

After having finished the meal I wanted to drink a coffee but unfortunately they don't sell it."
ChIJg9BxAhMoQg0RucLg0XEToGY,5,"Delicious roasted chicken, best meat I've had in Madrid. Also very affordable. Incredibly fast service despite the restaurant being completely packed when we were there. They forgot my salad but I'm happy because the bread and full chicken was more than enough. Bread is a bit crispy but great with the chicken sauce. They have no coffee or fries which surprised me. The Arroz con Leche was good too."
ChIJQccYvBMoQg0RMT_7u5Y2IQ4,5,"A beautiful experience at an outdoor cinema where we watched a 1920s silent film with live piano accompaniment. You can bring your own snacks and drinks, and they also sell refreshments at the location (be sure to purchase the tickets for refreshments as they don‚Äôt accept cash at the bar)."
ChIJQccYvBMoQg0RMT_7u5Y2IQ4,5,Nice outdoor movie experience on a summer night. You cannot bring your own food and drinks.  Prices at their bar are reasonable and is well organized with separate cashiers then food pick up counters. There are seats with tables on one side. Bring a cardigan or scarf as it's obviously cooler than in the city probably because of the river nearby. The toilets are clean with papers.
ChIJQccYvBMoQg0RMT_7u5Y2IQ4,5,"So... I went to this as a Spanish learner (far from fluent) so I didnt fully understand everything but the concept seemed great
The host was fantastic, funny and passionate about the film (The Bodyguard). The place was very busy and everyone had fun.

A great way to experience a film through someone elses eyes and heart. The food and drink was great too, and very good prices. As others point out, the seating is not very comfortable but overall a very fun experience, even for a non-native!"
ChIJQccYvBMoQg0RMT_7u5Y2IQ4,4,"Nice atmosphere and the best program of movies compared to other summer cinemas. The line for buying food is too long. It wasn't obvious that you have to buy food in the ticket zone and that waiting in another line to pick up the order. Seats are not comfortable, but it's ok for such type cinemas"
ChIJQccYvBMoQg0RMT_7u5Y2IQ4,4,Love this place for open air cin√©ma. Take care as you can only pay with cash and it is better to arrive at least 30th before the show to avoid queues. You can buy tickets online. There is a bar inside with drinks and sandwiches.
ChIJqRkui3IoQg0RDzttjhrks8I,1,"Very bad-tempered and rude employee, unable to explain the application and then not wanting to put the points on the user that I had previously registered and he just laughed with his colleagues, saying that he had not understood my question and that I would be left without the points."
ChIJqRkui3IoQg0RDzttjhrks8I,2,12 euros for two cups of blended ice with some syrup! Mocha frappuchino didn't have much taste and was mostly blended ice. The green velvet pistachio cream drink didn't look like anything on the picture and didn't taste like pistachio either. First time I encountered a Starbucks that is below the quality I expect a Starbucks to be.
ChIJqRkui3IoQg0RDzttjhrks8I,2,"Added more than a half of ice and some flavour. It's a coffee place not a cocktail one where you can get a lot of ice on your drinks.

Don't recommend this place at all."
ChIJqRkui3IoQg0RDzttjhrks8I,3,"The staff was friendly, good location but I ordered a frapuccino cookies and cream, it was the worst I‚Äôve ever had at any Starbuck, it was literally just shaved ice and some ‚Äúflavor‚Äù very disappointed, I always had great experience in other Starbucks locations."
ChIJqRkui3IoQg0RDzttjhrks8I,5,"Johana was really helpful bringing our drinks to our table because I have to use a crutch!

THANK YOU!!!!"
ChIJ5ygIU20oQg0RkaOIUy7m5i8,5,I like to go to chain stores because I feel assured of the quality and service.
ChIJ5ygIU20oQg0RkaOIUy7m5i8,1,"Really bad service when i needed to order my food! Those guys didn‚Äôt actually listen to me instead to redirected me to the app without offer any help, even though I‚Äôm old"
ChIJ5ygIU20oQg0RkaOIUy7m5i8,1,They left a sauce out of my order and put cheese to the potatoes that were ordered without it. The waiting time was very long because the place was horribly understaffed. There is a screen for the in process orders and done orders but the staff chooses to not use it which forces the customers to pack up next to the counter to hear when their order is done. Do not go to this KFC.
ChIJ5ygIU20oQg0RkaOIUy7m5i8,5,Excellent
ChIJ5ygIU20oQg0RkaOIUy7m5i8,5,"Very fast for a quick dinner and perfect located in Gran Via, close to Callao metro station."
ChIJqRkui3IoQg0RPIDrjGLY0yY,1,"The lady gave me a wrong order. She double punched it. When I complained about it, she doesnt want to admit that she made a mistake. I end up having no appetite, for paying for something i dont really want to eat. I am very furious im not coming back here again"
ChIJqRkui3IoQg0RPIDrjGLY0yY,5,"Very nice McDonalds, thank you so much!"
ChIJqRkui3IoQg0RPIDrjGLY0yY,1,They don't have the normal gluten free buns that McDonald's offer. So it's either don't order a burger or order one without a bun. Won't be coming back.
ChIJqRkui3IoQg0RPIDrjGLY0yY,4,"Pretty normal McDonald's. This one is a bit busier, and there isn't always enough seating. The restaurant was relatively clean. Some items are a bit pricier than I would expect such as the sundae. The taste of the food was okay."
ChIJqRkui3IoQg0RPIDrjGLY0yY,1,The food was terrible. My chicken burger had raw meat. The delux fries were undercooked inside. Never coming back again.
ChIJC3aMqHIoQg0RV-IOhMCIMKo,2,"Not good. We ordered grilled salmon and garlic prawns. The salmon was of a very good taste, but with a lot of grates and fat. The prawns were awful. No garlic at all, just plain oil. The guts were still inside of the prawns, tasted very sandy and crunched in my teeth. For dessert, we didn't really get to choose.. There were desserts on the menu, we saw that, but when I asked for it, they said there weren't desserts on the menu and that they only had ice-cream with whiskey and some kind of apple cake. So we ordered that. The ice-cream was alright. The apple pie was chewy and gross. Also, we paid a lot for not very good food üôÑ The two stars are for the nice waiter."
ChIJC3aMqHIoQg0RV-IOhMCIMKo,5,tasty food. cheap prises. amazing staff and service.
ChIJC3aMqHIoQg0RV-IOhMCIMKo,3,"Correct daily menu in the lines you expect in the area. Nothing out of this world but not bad. The dessert were especially good,
Service was attentive and although a little bit slow slow Spanish menu standards, that are faster that is considered fast food on most countries, and it seem the kitchen was a struggling to keep pace.
Good experience overall . Nothing to be amazed, but nothing to complain either."
ChIJC3aMqHIoQg0RV-IOhMCIMKo,5,"Went here for lunch on Tuesday 2nd May 2023.  The waitress was lovely, after apologising that her English wasn't very good, she conversed with us with no problems.  Food was great and inexpensive.  Highly recommend for lunch."
ChIJC3aMqHIoQg0RV-IOhMCIMKo,5,"Great daily Menu.
A grebat friendly place for a tapa or two, three, four"
ChIJx4y7qXIoQg0RyoxOEdxXXJk,4,"Monday 2x1 and wednesday part of the menu is at 1 euro, I was always going on wednesday and the food was ok for the price. The place has bit of a cold atmosphere but sushi at such a price must be tried! Also possible to take away or home delivery."
ChIJx4y7qXIoQg0RyoxOEdxXXJk,4,"The portion was pretty large, but the noodles were a bit dry. Recommended for a quick lunch."
ChIJx4y7qXIoQg0RyoxOEdxXXJk,4,"Nothing fancy, a standard wok and sushi place. Nice place to eat, good value for money."
ChIJx4y7qXIoQg0RyoxOEdxXXJk,4,"Good sushi for takeaway at a friendly price. Their boxes are great, you get a good combination of hot and cold food."
ChIJx4y7qXIoQg0RyoxOEdxXXJk,5,Good food at very good price. Come here on Mondays for 2x1 or Wednesday with some products for 1‚Ç¨.
ChIJ2R2DfnIoQg0RwhZG708DUtE,5,"üåü A Perfect Italian Experience at La Tagliatella! üåü‚Ä®We savored a crispy Margherita pizza, rich pesto pasta, creamy cappuccino with whipped cream, and a bold espresso ‚Äì all absolutely delicious! The service was excellent, the staff attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere warm and inviting. For authentic Italian flavors and generous portions, this is the place! Can‚Äôt wait to return! üçù‚òïÔ∏èüçï"
ChIJ2R2DfnIoQg0RwhZG708DUtE,5,"The service was perfect, The food was just excellent and we really enjoyed our time there!"
ChIJ2R2DfnIoQg0RwhZG708DUtE,4,"Amazing service. Food was good. The pizza has a thin crust and I looooved the pasta. The staff was suuuuper friendly and patient, and gave us lots of parmesan cheese."
ChIJ2R2DfnIoQg0RwhZG708DUtE,4,"I had dined at this place ten years ago and remembered it was the best olives and best Italian food I‚Äôve had in my life. Ten years later, the olives were still amazing, however the pasta was a little too al dente and a little too rich. The desert was delicious too. Service is amazing and I highly recommend. Next time I‚Äôll try the pizzas, they looked amazing."
ChIJ2R2DfnIoQg0RwhZG708DUtE,4,"Tasty with great service. I got the mushroom and scampi risotto which was not great looking but it tasted ok, only thing was, I got 4 scampi, a little too little for the price. Overall a decent meal, but don't know if I would choose that over other places nearby if you look at the value for flavor factor."
ChIJTWW1LnIoQg0RngBm6Kc9O2M,5,This place is excellent!!  We were served by Linda and Sonia and they were so nice and attentive. bMy first time here but I'll definetelly come back!! Recommended!!
ChIJTWW1LnIoQg0RngBm6Kc9O2M,5,"Very good food & customer service! ü•Çü•≥
c/o Linda Sonia Anna."
ChIJTWW1LnIoQg0RngBm6Kc9O2M,4,Tasty food and correct service. The Christmas Pancakes were delicious.
ChIJTWW1LnIoQg0RngBm6Kc9O2M,4,"Linda is very helpful, I couldn‚Äôt speak Spanish so she tried her best to help me understand, she‚Äôs very lovely and nice. Saw that my mom was wearing a hijab so she told me ‚Äúwe can make whatever dish you want without bacon‚Äù which I found so nice and sweet. The food is good and well seasoned"
ChIJTWW1LnIoQg0RngBm6Kc9O2M,5,"Linda was very kind, and helped us with the menu. Such a sweet lady!! "
ChIJA2a1LnIoQg0RWsRmPmxH_ek,5,"We had the two vegan sandwiches on the menu in between train trips. I am happy to report they were both delicious, and the bread was particularly wonderful. Our server Monica was absolutelywonderful and patient with my faltering Spanish."
ChIJA2a1LnIoQg0RWsRmPmxH_ek,5,"I came with my family, we had a so good experience. The man explained us everything perfectly, and the food was also perfect."
ChIJA2a1LnIoQg0RWsRmPmxH_ek,2,"I wanted gluten free bread and the female employee didn't give to me. She Said no. And the patatas bravas were terrible, needed more time to fry, the sauce was very bad"
ChIJA2a1LnIoQg0RWsRmPmxH_ek,5,Previous reviews were scary but I saw non of that. The place was clean and the guy behind the counter was pleasant and efficient despite being the only one serving. He even waved at me when my food was ready. Food was good but the 5 stars are for the staff.
ChIJA2a1LnIoQg0RWsRmPmxH_ek,3,"Good place for a quick bite, but nothing too sophisticated!"
ChIJ7aulb3IoQg0RmesWZmN7M44,5,Very busy at night. There's a bit too much bread in each sandwich; honestly I would prefer if there was the same amount of sandwich interior but they were open-faced. The drinks were refreshing.
ChIJ7aulb3IoQg0RmesWZmN7M44,4,"The atmosphere overall is good, although the space is a bit small. The service is great! There was always a waiter that maintained the table cleaned. I recommend this franchise any time that anyone needs a quick meal or hang with friends."
ChIJ7aulb3IoQg0RmesWZmN7M44,4,"They are all great. The staff works really hard, despite of the lengthy service it‚Äôs just the sheer amount of orders. Great beers and the Latino is like a wine cider, very nice too. All the montaditos I had were quite nice, they are served warm and it is super great value! Go to every one you see around!"
ChIJ7aulb3IoQg0RmesWZmN7M44,5,"100 montaditos is an excellent place if you want to have an affordable snack and beer. On Wednesdays and Sundays, all the menu is 1‚Ç¨ per piece. So you can eat delicious sandwiches and be full for less than 6‚Ç¨ per person."
ChIJ7aulb3IoQg0RmesWZmN7M44,4,"Come here for quick, cheap eats. Don‚Äôt expect high quality food.

Patatas fritas 4 salsas: good, served nice and hot

Salchichas 4 salsas: very soft, no snap to them at all. Very disappointed (I‚Äôm from the US and I prefer the hot dog skin to be firm with a nice crunch/snap when I bite into it)

#5 pollo kebab y salsa bbq: this was small but was very tasty. Chicken was nice and tender.

Can‚Äôt beat the prices here!!"
ChIJkbahUU8pQg0RiEP7sQ4EAaw,2,"coffee notsogood.
The service is not so kind."
ChIJkbahUU8pQg0RiEP7sQ4EAaw,3,Not a fan of the stand they have in pr√≠ncipe pio. Cortado was subpar.
ChIJkbahUU8pQg0RiEP7sQ4EAaw,4,"Spanish chain offering coffee, sandwiches etc. Good quality and consistent products, but there is not much of a view in this bus station."
ChIJkbahUU8pQg0RiEP7sQ4EAaw,5,"Breakfast as good as always. Quiet and relaxing. Best tien, early morning when opening, at list for me"
ChIJkbahUU8pQg0RiEP7sQ4EAaw,4,"We were eating a focaccia menu and it was very good, good quality/price ratio, we just need a little more products to choose from, the tableware was made of earthenware and glass (not cardboard as some say), I found it to be a quiet and pleasant space, I think it also depends on how predisposed you are to have a good time and not look for problems and bad messes"
ChIJDxzTCHIoQg0RXCF6KH9YpYw,5,"great surprise !! loved it. arrived Madrid and Cafe Del Rey was near by
highly recommended, service is nice and welcoming, take care, explain. great food. prices are a bit high, yet it worth it !! for sure will come again before leaving Madrid"
ChIJDxzTCHIoQg0RXCF6KH9YpYw,5,"We had to wait for a table for 7 and lots of smaller parties passed us, but we understand there are restrictions due to Covid. While we were waiting we were very impressed with the host (bald guy with a great spirit) who kept us very updated on the status of our table. They have a good and organized system. We are foreigners but speak Spanish and he didn‚Äôt treat us differently just because we weren‚Äôt native speakers. Of course the ambiance inside is awesome, lighting rocks, and very good cocktails. The tapas were great, patatas bravas were excellent. Jefferson was also a great waiter and very nice, bottoms up."
ChIJDxzTCHIoQg0RXCF6KH9YpYw,5,"This will be one of my favourite restaurants in Madrid. Located behind Prince Pio Station, it has a perfect environment and delicious food. Excelent service and lovely place. 100% recommended !!"
ChIJDxzTCHIoQg0RXCF6KH9YpYw,5,"Great fun!! üèñÔ∏è‚õ±Ô∏èüåäüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Lovely chilled international atmosphere and friendly service. Massively spacious terrace and yes, real sand, really does feel like a chiringuito by the beach/sea

Food is international and ideal for sharing, the guacamole was delicious (and spicy) and a MUST. The cocktail menu is also reasonably priced even though the Daiquiri was a bit lacklustre.

Also bonus - Carla is lovely!"
ChIJDxzTCHIoQg0RXCF6KH9YpYw,5,"Amazing ambiance, you really feel outside Madrid. Very good service, fast and kind. Jeferson was specially attentive with us. The food was really good and very well served. The only thing is that is a little overpriced for an informal place, but It is  understandable for the good quality of food and service. :)"
ChIJV99f8nIoQg0R7wgkKfmvmJk,5,"The food was very tasty,  great options and Men√∫ del D√≠a very reasonable.  The service was an experience in of itself -- friendly, fast, efficient and with added ""free"" appetizers and after lunch shot of liquor.  Definitely worth saving as a favorite spot to eat...great location close to Principe Pio Shopping Center,  next to RENFE train station üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
ChIJV99f8nIoQg0R7wgkKfmvmJk,5,"Really nice place, staff very friendly and very professional. Been here every day after work for a beer and greeted with great service ,great beer and amazing tapas. Decided the final night of our work trip to have dinner here and was amazed at the quality and taste of the food. If I'm back here working it will be the first place I visit."
ChIJV99f8nIoQg0R7wgkKfmvmJk,1,"Awful service. Seems like waiter just rating you or doing you a favour. All mixed up order in a half empty restaurant.

Brought us some snacks which we didn‚Äôt order and the was surprised that we asked him to take those back.

Dry stail bread at 2eur per person serving!

Croquets consisting of bechamel only. Worse than supermarket quality.

Bringing beer by holding half filled cubatas glasses by the rim with dirty hands.

To be avoided at all costs."
ChIJV99f8nIoQg0R7wgkKfmvmJk,4,"This was a very enjoyable and lucky find in a neighbourhood that doesn‚Äôt really attract tourists. The food is good, decently priced, and served with a smile. The clams and the monkfish were both done well."
ChIJV99f8nIoQg0R7wgkKfmvmJk,5,Fantastic dinner with our madrile√±os friends.
ChIJJfEvkQgpQg0Rl38LUTepEXo,5,"Amazing experience.
You get the little restaurant to yourself (it only has 1 table) and the chef is preparing all dishes in front of you. The food was delicious and special. The mix of flavours in each dish just worked really well.
You will not find this place unless you're looking for it - it's hidden away in a patio. But it's definitely worth the visit.
Make sure you reserve in advance though!"
ChIJJfEvkQgpQg0Rl38LUTepEXo,5,"Experience top
Chef top
Until next time ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJJfEvkQgpQg0Rl38LUTepEXo,5,"We loved dining here. The food is of high quality and at a very good price. The preparations are unbeatable. Quite an experience, highly recommended. We will return."
ChIJJfEvkQgpQg0Rl38LUTepEXo,5,Quite a discovery. Excellent quality product made by Jorge with the utmost care in front of you. We were a group of 8 people who enjoyed the omakase menu (8 dishes) with the place exclusively for us. We drank four bottles of Albari√±o and paid about 45 euros per person. An experience to repeat...
ChIJJfEvkQgpQg0Rl38LUTepEXo,5,"Awesome! It has been a long time since I enjoyed dining in a restaurant so much. Everything was spectacularly good. The raw material is the best, the way of preparing it and explaining each dish is great and the flavor is unbeatable. Jorge, the chef, was very friendly and approachable, and makes the experience great. We made the 8-9 step menu and without a doubt, we will return. I recommend it to everyone!"
ChIJEUVY1lEpQg0RZ18DUcL8gX4,5,"Really nice small place with great food. Food is fresh, quite fast and the service is nice. We had the brochetas al carbon and we will return to try other things"
ChIJEUVY1lEpQg0RZ18DUcL8gX4,5,"Great, DON'T NEXT, I give it 5 stars because they don't let me give it more, delicious food, delicious homemade desserts and 10/10 service."
ChIJEUVY1lEpQg0RZ18DUcL8gX4,5,"Spectacular! The cuisine is very tasty, the atmosphere is unbeatable and they make you feel at home. The flavor that the charcoal grill gives is unmatched."
ChIJEUVY1lEpQg0RZ18DUcL8gX4,5,"A spectacle, 10 for the treatment, the chicken and the potatoes. Fantastic. There was a need for a place like this in the neighborhood."
ChIJEUVY1lEpQg0RZ18DUcL8gX4,5,The crispy grilled sprawled chicken and the fried yucca with chimichurri sauce‚Ä¶ spectacular!!!
ChIJBzvaVwooQg0RGjdFfAODB_s,1,I found a hair in my food. The treatment was bad. The ideal place for flag patriots who enslave immigrants without a contract to avoid paying taxes.
ChIJBzvaVwooQg0RGjdFfAODB_s,1,"Lots of Spanish bars but not a single Spaniard working‚Ä¶

Quite a rare card and they are missing half of the things."
ChIJBzvaVwooQg0RGjdFfAODB_s,5,"Wonderful, good wines and best service"
ChIJBzvaVwooQg0RGjdFfAODB_s,5,"Spectacular attention and professionalism from Lola and Mari, we will definitely return."
ChIJBzvaVwooQg0RGjdFfAODB_s,1,I entered hungry and left hungry and wanting to apply for a new nationality
ChIJW3FH2KMpQg0RiWlf9_V27tQ,5,Good place for a beer while waiting for your laundry to run a block away
ChIJW3FH2KMpQg0RiWlf9_V27tQ,5,Very nice and fresh food
ChIJW3FH2KMpQg0RiWlf9_V27tQ,2,"Check the bill with the letter next to it (or take a photo before ordering) because they charge extra for everything. They charged us ‚Ç¨8 per sandwich (their price on the terrace was ‚Ç¨7.20 with supplement) and ‚Ç¨3.50 for each double (and the menu said ‚Ç¨3.20) and we told them and the Latin waitress was very rude and said that the menu was not updated. And is it the client's fault? Obviously not. If we ask for the menu we understand that if we don't know, it tells us that it has the correct prices. He should have apologized and corrected his mistake. The bad manners when telling him and his response mean that we will not return again. There are more bars and better terraces nearby."
ChIJW3FH2KMpQg0RiWlf9_V27tQ,1,"We were a group of about 10 people with the intention of eating something at this place, which in theory specializes in hamburgers. As soon as we arrived, they told us that they didn't have hamburger buns, or any type of bread, and basically that there was no food. Despite this, we agreed to stay and ask if there were any other options.

After a while, we saw that they were serving salchipapas to another table, so we politely insisted to see if they could at least do the same for us. They finally agreed, but it was after quite a bit of insistence. The food, unfortunately, was terrible, and they still charged us ‚Ç¨40 for the sausages, which seemed completely disproportionate to us.

The worst thing was that, just as we were leaving, we saw several full hamburgers coming out of the kitchen for another table, which left us perplexed after they assured us that they had no food. When asking for explanations, the response was quite unpleasant, even with bad manners for simply asking.

A very unprofessional experience and not recommended. I hope they improve both in attention and in consistency and respect for customers."
ChIJW3FH2KMpQg0RiWlf9_V27tQ,1,"We were a group of 10 people with the intention of having hamburgers for dinner. From the first moment we were told that there was no bread, and when we specifically asked if they had hamburger buns, the answer was no.
We accepted the situation, although it seemed strange to us. But then we saw sausages coming out of the kitchen, which also fell to the floor while they were being served, and it was not clear what exactly they did with them.

Even though they had told us that there was no food, we asked them for some salchipapas. They were very bad. Seriously, probably the worst sausages we've ever tried. Even so, they charged us 40 euros for that.

To top it all off, just as we were leaving, having eaten and paid, we saw how they brought out three complete hamburgers, with bread, from the kitchen. I mean, they did have bread, and they were serving hamburgers, right after they had denied us.

And to top it off, they scolded us, for no reason. A total lack of respect.

We do not recommend this place at all. The service was terrible, the food was bad, the treatment was rude and the prices were disproportionate. A real disappointment."
ChIJB_Dry_MpQg0Ro7F_pkofR3I,5,"A few steps from Puerta del √Ångel (metro) came across this rare, new, with a modern touch, coffee place. The interior is so delicate, it will attract you. So good to spend time with friends, a nice chat and a good coffee."
ChIJB_Dry_MpQg0Ro7F_pkofR3I,4,"Relatively new place. The decoration is super pretty with many books that give the name to the super cozy place.
Food that is made to order. All very good."
ChIJB_Dry_MpQg0Ro7F_pkofR3I,4,"Very good food, surprising even. A quantity of not leaving hungry.
The service is good and fast, the only thing I would have a problem with is the placement of the tables in the interior.
The decoration is quite interesting, in keeping with the name of the bar.
The price is very competitive with the rest of the area."
ChIJB_Dry_MpQg0Ro7F_pkofR3I,5,"Nice idea from the businessman already known for running another establishment on the promenade when starting a bar with such a peculiar style.  My personal thanks for investing and creating jobs in the neighborhood, so I wish you a good result. Regarding the dishes, I am sure they will not disappoint. On my first visit I noticed that the waiters are not as attentive as they should be."
ChIJB_Dry_MpQg0Ro7F_pkofR3I,5,"Excellent staff and treatment, always attentive and available seeking customer satisfaction.
The details distinguish them, you can see an example...always very grateful, more than recommended."
ChIJX4ZaiwkoQg0RMD60LnQmbno,5,"Nice place for refreshment - good service, good prices and fine ambient..."
ChIJX4ZaiwkoQg0RMD60LnQmbno,5,Tasty tradition Madrid 's (super fat) beakfast for good price (5‚Ç¨ person)
ChIJX4ZaiwkoQg0RMD60LnQmbno,4,"If you want to try authentic churros and porras (bigger version of churros) with chocolate, you need to pass by this place. It's always busy, so probably you'll need to wait until someone leave this table to take a seat."
ChIJX4ZaiwkoQg0RMD60LnQmbno,5,"The best churros we had so far, and great prices too!"
ChIJX4ZaiwkoQg0RMD60LnQmbno,5,Ricooo
ChIJW4F1S5UpQg0RrOevaq8kqtw,5,"Lovely staff, they saved our night: only thing open late in the night. Not possible to eat there but take away works well."
ChIJW4F1S5UpQg0RrOevaq8kqtw,5,Food is very good and nice service
ChIJW4F1S5UpQg0RrOevaq8kqtw,1,"These scammers took advantage and on the day of the blackout when no one had anything to eat, they raised the prices of the entire menu by double or even triple. In addition, they were missing ingredients and were selling empty kebabs for ‚Ç¨6 when they normally cost ‚Ç¨3. A shame that in times of need they took advantage of people."
ChIJW4F1S5UpQg0RrOevaq8kqtw,1,"I went on a Saturday at 8 p.m. and there was no one in the place. Only two employees and a pile of dried meat and some potatoes, already fried in a bowl. He reheated that for me and put it in cold bread. And I asked him for a durum."
ChIJW4F1S5UpQg0RrOevaq8kqtw,5,"Today I went to pick up the order and I really liked the taste of the durum. Both the meat and the sauce were very delicious. Also, I called and as soon as I arrived (just 5 minutes later) it was almost ready, so fast service. A good kebap option in the area."
ChIJGV8zqggpQg0RtxSGKua_KTs,4,"Rice with tomato, fried eggs and banana was good, however I would prefer it without the banana. Special vegetarian wrap was the best. Good place to have a quick lunch."
ChIJGV8zqggpQg0RtxSGKua_KTs,5,"Very tasty and good prices:)The employees are very polite and friendly, they helped me with the choice of food. I recommend taking the dish of the day, for 10 euros you will get two main courses, a dessert and a drink, it will be very satisfying and tasty! Muchas gracias!)"
ChIJGV8zqggpQg0RtxSGKua_KTs,4,Good vegetarian food and coffee. Lots of choices including pad Thai.
ChIJGV8zqggpQg0RtxSGKua_KTs,4,"Simple place with no frills for some decent vegetarian wraps.

*Update*
Tried their tea, they have a wonderful collection of teas.
For an extra ‚Ç¨1, you can order some yummy patatas fritas with your wraps."
ChIJGV8zqggpQg0RtxSGKua_KTs,5,I had the pollo wrap it was great though a lot of sauce and my partner got the teriyaki wrap and it was delicious. Potatoes are good as well. Recommend this place üëç

The food was excellent, the service was brilliant!
Definitely recommend if you're passing!"

ChIJiQY7-AooQg0Ry1z3--bWOgs,4,"Food was good and fresh.

Nice bar, but waiters look not very pleasant sometimes‚Ä¶"
ChIJiQY7-AooQg0Ry1z3--bWOgs,5,We came back 3 nights in a row! What a great place! It ticked all the boxes! Lola was the greatest host!
ChIJiQY7-AooQg0Ry1z3--bWOgs,5,This place is very lovely.I really enjoyed the food and the staff is amazing thanks LOS 60
ChIJTejKRgooQg0RLORVCUyoZpM,3,"Average bar outside Puerta del Angel tube st, food it's ok mainly for salted breakfast, but the croissant are just horrible. Crowd is usually over 40 so wouldn't recommended really for kids. Staff is friendly but again notting extremely professional."
ChIJTejKRgooQg0RLORVCUyoZpM,1,Terrible service. I almost missed my flight because they came at 8 clock while i had already agreed with them to give back the car earlier. I paid twice the isuranse and i did not recieve my refund yet( its been over a month ). I wont risk rent a car from such a company.
ChIJTejKRgooQg0RLORVCUyoZpM,4,Ok
ChIJTejKRgooQg0RLORVCUyoZpM,1,Bar
ChIJTejKRgooQg0RLORVCUyoZpM,4,I enjoyed it.
ChIJhyMck0ApQg0R_wS94guhwac,5,"We ordered pink tomato salad with belly, various croquettes, and broken eggs with chistorra. What delicious food, please. The bread was great. The waiter's attention was super warm. A place to repeat with great pleasure."
ChIJhyMck0ApQg0R_wS94guhwac,5,Bar worth it. The waitress's attention was incredible! The food was delicious (we ate the tomato salad and the potatoes) and on top of it with the usual beer and ice-cold glasses without the smell of fish. I will return as soon as I am back in the area
ChIJhyMck0ApQg0R_wS94guhwac,5,"I ate a homemade menu that was very delicious and the two waiters treated me very well.
I had two starters and dessert and everything was very good."
ChIJhyMck0ApQg0R_wS94guhwac,5,"Excellent place to go for a drink, the service is very good, the league games are on and the atmosphere is pleasant! Special mention for Juan who is very attentive and helpful. Advisable!!!"
ChIJhyMck0ApQg0R_wS94guhwac,5,"A great discovery! The food is very delicious and homemade. The staff was very friendly, they treated us very well. Highly recommended, there are varied dishes and the menu is great. We will surely repeat. One thing to note is that you can go by car because the owner has free parking spaces next to the restaurant."
ChIJ8_nR4FYpQg0RfZFjSIGi6dc,1,"The empanadas at the spectacular place, I was there tonight 04/20/25 at 10:45, and I ordered 3 empanadas and a drink, the girl who served me who had Latin features was charming, but once they gave me the empanadas and the drinks a tall woman came out, and in a bad manner told me that I couldn't even be in the place because they were already going to close and that I had to leave, I have worked in hospitality for 20 years and I am very understanding of closing times, but I think that education is very important, that is why I write this message, I have come to this site several times and it is the first time that something like this has happened to me, I do not think they are the appropriate ways, that bad way this person had in addressing me"
ChIJ8_nR4FYpQg0RfZFjSIGi6dc,4,"The dumplings are very good in general, but for some time now the soft meat ones have gotten much worse. The last 2 times I have bought them they have had a lot of nerve or cartilage that could not be bitten.
A while ago they made a pretty big price increase, but they're still pretty good."
ChIJ8_nR4FYpQg0RfZFjSIGi6dc,5,It is always an excellent idea to stop by in the afternoon for a coffee and some croissants to remember my dear Buenos Aires üòçüëåüèº
ChIJ8_nR4FYpQg0RfZFjSIGi6dc,5,"The establishment is beautiful and the empanadas are exquisite, the one from ""PAMPA"" is recommended."
ChIJ8_nR4FYpQg0RfZFjSIGi6dc,2,"Today we bought for the second time and the meat empanadas were NOT good at all. A lot of fat and a very strong flavor, nor do I recommend them at all.
The chicken, onion and cheese, ham and cheese, and blue cheese were very good.
Another comment: the apple empanadas were too toasted.
I have no desire to repeat it at all."
ChIJ08x0tcMpQg0RtxrrdngyBog,5,Ordered a ceviche and pisco sour. Both were fantastic! I'll definitely return.
ChIJ08x0tcMpQg0RtxrrdngyBog,5,Best Lunch menu in the area- authentic Peruvian cuisine and very friendly staff! Super affordable 12 Set menu ‚òÄÔ∏è
ChIJ08x0tcMpQg0RtxrrdngyBog,5,Amazing food and very friendly service - I will return very soon!
ChIJ08x0tcMpQg0RtxrrdngyBog,5,Really nice little bar & restaurant with the most amazing peruvian food I've ever had. The owner/waiter is amazing as well and passionate about the food he serves and proposes. I will come back!!
ChIJ08x0tcMpQg0RtxrrdngyBog,5,"Very professional and friendly service. They really care about the food they serve you and make sure to ask what you thought about it.
The owner saw me eating the ceviche with a fork and told me I should use a spoon and explained why. They really care and it shows. Very nice, highly recommend it. Also the food was amazing. The ceviche, bastones de yuquita and arroz chaufa were great"
ChIJcb6w7QkoQg0RV907erbc7uM,5,Best kebab and prices in PDA. great all around
ChIJcb6w7QkoQg0RV907erbc7uM,5,"It is the best kebab in my taste in Madrid, it is normal for this phrase to be repeated because everything you eat from there is delicious. In that which of the durum. Wowwww they are great and they are amazing XXL! And it sells it to you like a normal one. Nothing about putting corn in it like in some that I have seen in C√°diz. Aurenticos!!! Of all life!!! The cook sneezed 3 times and three times he raised his hands halfway up his arm and dried himself with napkins!! A üîü"
ChIJcb6w7QkoQg0RV907erbc7uM,5,"For my personal taste, the best Kebab in Madrid. Excellent treatment with the staff as well as good quality and quantity for the price!!"
ChIJcb6w7QkoQg0RV907erbc7uM,5,"The best kebab place in Madrid. Impressive quality, feels good, good price, lots of quantity and good people."
ChIJcb6w7QkoQg0RV907erbc7uM,5,The food is good and the quantities are generous. The price is cheap. I recommend the fries.

ChIJufDVvF8pQg0RzafU1mZqPP8,5,"Finding this bar suddenly saved the night for a whole gang of friends. Erika, one of the owners of the bar, was incredible with us, being super friendly, adapting the space to us, thanking all our drinks with snack details and we had a great night thanks to her kindness. Thank you Erika and company!"
ChIJufDVvF8pQg0RzafU1mZqPP8,1,"Slow service.
Expensive for what they offer.
It doesn't have anything special.
We ordered a portion of chicken strips, literally 8 strips for 11 euros, yes, two kilos of potatoes to fill the plate.
You have to ask for accompanying sauces separately (but they don't charge you for it).
The chicken sandwich has nothing characteristic, it is toasted bread with a little chicken, leaves and cheese, and more potatoes."
ChIJufDVvF8pQg0RzafU1mZqPP8,5,"We ordered the bravas, calamari and teque√±os with two egg whites. Everything was fantastic! Super recommended!!!!!! The bravas have their special sauce that gives them a spicy touch that leaves you wanting more and more. The squid batter was crunchy and the teque√±os with sweet and sour sauce were delicious!!!!!!!! I really want to continue trying more menus! Lastly, the claritas with their foam/cream gave a great taste to the dinner! Thank you for everything, you are wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
ChIJufDVvF8pQg0RzafU1mZqPP8,1,‚Ç¨3.20 for a 33cl bottle of water with 4 olives. Nothing to add ü§Øüí∞
ChIJbahSzXYpQg0ROmLrEAW4T-8,5,"A very nice pizzeria and the owner is welcoming and pleasant, in one of the nights during our stay we came after the closing hours and he reopened the pizzeria to make us the order. The pizza is very good and fresh."
ChIJbahSzXYpQg0ROmLrEAW4T-8,5,"Amazing pizza, quick service and great staff."
ChIJbahSzXYpQg0ROmLrEAW4T-8,5,Great pizza at a great price and the person running it is super nice and has fresh ingredients. They deliver and there is take out but I think there is no seating available.
ChIJbahSzXYpQg0ROmLrEAW4T-8,5,"Local one-man pizza joint. Only take-out, no delivery and no space to eat. Cheap and very tasty, always hits the spot."
ChIJbahSzXYpQg0ROmLrEAW4T-8,5,it's the best Pizza in Town!
ChIJ2XuLIAWJQQ0RQ-sdKMKQNLk,5,"Delicious delicious delicious. We had the smash burger which was incredible, bravas and a mix of all the croquetas - everything was so so good. Highly recommend and service was great too!"
ChIJ2XuLIAWJQQ0RQ-sdKMKQNLk,5,"Que rico todo! Delicious croquetas, in an array of savoury flavours AND surprising sweet ones too! Victoria beer on tap: watch your waistline because it's all dangerously tasty. Gracias, Croqstars!
Added Dec 2023: omg what a burger. It was so big I needed cutlery, so juicy, so full of stuff!!! Wow!"
ChIJ2XuLIAWJQQ0RQ-sdKMKQNLk,5,Great variety of croquets with 5 different drippings! strongly recommend menu with 10 croquetas and potatoes for 12‚Ç¨!
ChIJ2XuLIAWJQQ0RQ-sdKMKQNLk,5,Awesome new idea! Have been 3 times now and still not tried everything. Highly recommended
ChIJ2XuLIAWJQQ0RQ-sdKMKQNLk,4,"Recommended place. You have to carefully consider what you order because the food is overwhelming. The burgers come with 2 croquettes inside depending on your selection, although they can be served separately.
The burgers are pretty good and so are the croquettes.
I imagine that dedicating yourself to three products is fine.
I recommend it"
ChIJ1ev4ZwooQg0RBfGp2CcKTns,5,"Tasty and recommended. Nice and clean, good music and the background, I asked for a miso soup, mini baos and a poke.
I enjoyed."
ChIJ1ev4ZwooQg0RBfGp2CcKTns,5,Tasty sashimi and sushi. Very friendly staff.
ChIJ1ev4ZwooQg0RBfGp2CcKTns,3,"It was a good miso soup, decent sushi and OK Katsu Curry. The service while polite is not what I will consider the best. The place was full of boxes, and got in and first thing I saw was the delivery guys slouching waiting to be sent out and a set of dirty dishes in a table in front of them. Nothing against the delivery guys neither the fact that they where sitting waiting but not the most attractive entrance.
Work a bit on how the place looks will attract more customers, do more business from the customers dinning in and not from delivery."
ChIJ1ev4ZwooQg0RBfGp2CcKTns,5,Amazing!!! So fresh! So good! Great food and service. The girl is super nice!
ChIJ1ev4ZwooQg0RBfGp2CcKTns,5,"Very quick to serve food, wonderful and tasty üîÆ"
ChIJ15F3gmUoQg0R14unkpxcexE,4,"Pretty good. The pork knuckle is amazing, the sausages are equally amazing, the Wiener schnitzel was okay (a little dry). The beer selection was great and the menu was spot on. The dining room is a little tired. The service was good but not very friendly."
ChIJ15F3gmUoQg0R14unkpxcexE,4,"Nice place to go with friends! Good German food, very good beer, easy location (next to Plaza de Espa√±a), not much expensive. It's a great option to have a ""different"" meal!"
ChIJ15F3gmUoQg0R14unkpxcexE,5,Very great place and waiter kindness. We ate local and german food. Fully recommendable.
ChIJ15F3gmUoQg0R14unkpxcexE,5,ü§© I loves this place the beer is outstanding nd the german dishesü´† yummy
ChIJ15F3gmUoQg0R14unkpxcexE,5,Authentic German food at a reasonable price with great service. Would definitely come again
ChIJq7CeMXooQg0R_hpsTD6w1BQ,5,We were a group of 7 and had lunch in an attractive small private dining room. We hadn't been here for a long time and were impressed with the quality. We were regular customers in the mid-1970¬¥s when it was run personally by Padre Luis Lezama. His legacy lives on.
ChIJq7CeMXooQg0R_hpsTD6w1BQ,5,"What a gem!
On Christmas it was hard to find a place to eat. By chance, we chose this place. And what a pleasant surprise!!
This is an establishment with history and it shows. From the moment we stepped in, through the pictures on the walls and the transparent kitchen.
The dishes were very tasty, not overpriced and beautiful.
We were too full for desserts, but received one, on the house, and it was delicious.
We had cured salmon to share as a starter, lamb chops and ox tail as main, water, soda and a glass of red wine. Total 95 euros.
Highly recommend."
ChIJq7CeMXooQg0R_hpsTD6w1BQ,5,"This place has been on my radar for years. I stopped in for lunch on a busy Sunday but was a little early. Managed to get a great table just inside past the bar. The classic Spanish dishes here are authentic and delicious. Garlic shrimp and rabo de toro both cooked and presented perfectly! A selection of tapas from the bar makes the meal complete. Also, plenty of wine to choose from. Service is professional. As we were finishing, the place was full, so go early and enjoy."
ChIJq7CeMXooQg0R_hpsTD6w1BQ,5,"We spent 2 weeks in Madrid and went 4 times, service was outstanding, food was great (any of the available pintxos on display is fabulous) and their wine (Rioja) delicious - excellent location - can only recommend üëåüèªüá™üá∏"
ChIJq7CeMXooQg0R_hpsTD6w1BQ,5,"Just perfect. Authentic Spanish experience. The food is delicious, the wine great too, and the service friendly by real pros who care about their profession and traditions. We ate tapas standing at the bar, and were the only tourists in the whole restaurant (non-Spanish ones anyway!) Very reasonable prices for the quality."
ChIJU8gAMHsoQg0RWlzOlfmhGNg,5,"Food is so good here. We ordered the tasting menu with small plates of many dishes. It is really very good food and deep flavours of the Japanese food.
Expensive of course. But dont miss this place."
ChIJU8gAMHsoQg0RWlzOlfmhGNg,3,"I had the menu de sushi which is 30‚Ç¨ and my boyfriend had menu de iberico which is around ‚Ç¨30 (I am not sure about the number i remember it was around thr same price as the menu de sushi). I thought it was pricey for what it is. Okay so regarding the sushi and tempura, I know Madrid is not the best city to get sushi, so I am not going to say anything about the sushi because as a east asian person growing up eating a lot of sashimi, sushi, tempuras the whole life in Asia, I do know that my standard is quiet up high. The way they make tempura here should be amended honestly. But it is Madrid so I let it slide on this one.
But let me tell you what, the Ib√©rico dish was a such a disappointment. The flavor being so sweet, the small portion. Is it really worth 30euros? I don't know about that."
ChIJU8gAMHsoQg0RWlzOlfmhGNg,5,"- Delicious nigiris
- I recommend the spicy tuna roll and miso soup."
ChIJU8gAMHsoQg0RWlzOlfmhGNg,5,Great food and service! Better than most of the restos around the plaza.
ChIJU8gAMHsoQg0RWlzOlfmhGNg,4,"A good choice for having Japanese food. At the beginning we were doubting but the restaurant was very impressive. In my opinion as a Japanese food lover:

ChIJy0Hh83ooQg0R51xynRVNQqI,5,"My wife and I went to El Senador for a dinner and we were blown away as much by the simplicity of the food as by its great taste. This place is in its own league.
The service was simple, people friendly and wine was excellent.
The only logical outcome were our empty plates.
We are strongly recommending this restaurant to all meat lovers. You will not be dissapointed."
ChIJy0Hh83ooQg0R51xynRVNQqI,4,"A must-try for cochinillo lovers
El Senador, located near the Spanish Senate in Madrid, offers an exceptional dining experience. The cochinillo asado (roast suckling pig) is outstanding‚Äîcrispy skin with tender, flavorful meat. The staff is attentive and provides excellent recommendations, enhancing the overall experience. While it‚Äôs on the pricier side, the quality and service make it well worth it. Perfect for a special meal in the heart of the city"
ChIJy0Hh83ooQg0R51xynRVNQqI,5,"Tried this place after hearing good things, and overall, it was a good experience. The food was tasty, and the service was friendly, but nothing really stood out as exceptional. It‚Äôs a solid spot for a meal, but I wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to come back. Worth trying if you‚Äôre in the area!"
ChIJy0Hh83ooQg0R51xynRVNQqI,5,"There is a Spanish only menu with a bit more options.

The service was outstanding and fast. The breads that came with the sausages are additional charge. So if you don't want, you need to ask to send them back. I knew they charge and the sausages were delicious. 5/5

Callos 4/5. The callos was so rich. I would need to dip with bread. It was too rich to be eaten alone. I'm not sure how to eat this stew by itself.

Salmon croquettes 4/5. The croquettes were super cheesy so it really depends on your taste. The meal was so full and was intended to be shared.

At the end, the restaurant gave us free coffee shot. It was the first time some restaurant in Madrid even gave out something free.

The restaurant itself was quiet and we went, there were many empty tables."
ChIJy0Hh83ooQg0R51xynRVNQqI,3,"We came here for the famous Spanish roasted piglets and were not disappointed.  It must have been roasted immediately after we ordered - the meat was succulent and the skin was crispy.  I‚Äôd like it more if it was a bit more seasoned.  The fish were okay only.  The decor was pretty and service was nice but I‚Äôd prefer a bit more personal.  All in all, it was a reasonably good semi-fine dining experience."
ChIJUz2orHsoQg0RXai91u3ei1g,4,"This is a traditional restaurant with over a century of history, specializing in stewed pot dishes. To be honest, as a foreign traveler, I found the flavors a bit difficult to get used to. However, this is purely a matter of personal taste and has nothing to do with the restaurant itself. Still, I made an effort to finish everything out of respect for the chef and the food. I believe that part of the joy of traveling is experiencing local cuisine at long-established, traditional restaurants."
ChIJUz2orHsoQg0RXai91u3ei1g,5,Strongly recommend. Very good food especially their stew. One portion is good for 2 people. Reservation is a must. Lamb is excellent. A reminder: keep a copy of your reservation email because they missed our reservation at our arrival.
ChIJUz2orHsoQg0RXai91u3ei1g,5,"Historic place!
Very blessed for the opportunity to be able to enjoy lunch there. We just walked in there believing that we could find a table. For our surprise, the person the received us said that was unprovable to sit us, but anyway she consulted with an emerging gentleman that joined the conversation, telling us that the only chance was to wait for about 1.5 to 2 hours. Then; thanks God the last consult was done to our afternoon hero. This senior waitress gave us the best smile on the city along with a service that we will never forget. Yes, he found the way to sit us and in addition was very supportive and gentle, giving us the most charm service during our visit to the city."
ChIJUz2orHsoQg0RXai91u3ei1g,5,"The perfect cocido to have to end the winter season! Superb cocido. It wasn‚Äôt too heavy nor too little. Soup was so good too!

We also had a vegetable entree to start which was one of the best I‚Äôve had in Madrid. Dessert was an apple tart with turrones ice cream!!

Definitely would come here even during the summer because not only was food superb, the service was 100%"
ChIJUz2orHsoQg0RXai91u3ei1g,5,"Excellent authentic Madrid food. Highly recommend a reservation. Legends like Nadal, casillas, Diego simeone have graced this establishment"
ChIJ_Tki6XsoQg0RYm66u5kmIhA,5,"Without doubt one of the best and most authentic Mexican restaurants in Madrid. Great (and not too extensive) selection of dishes at reasonable prices. The fish tacos were delicious, as were the pork belly variants. For the mains, we opted for the ""langostinos rey"" king prawns with totopos, and the pork fillet mole. Both were delicious and the tortillas that came with were light and fresh. All was washed down with a couple of margaritas and Mexican-style cocktails which were very tasty...and quite strong! I'll be back to work my way through the menu and hopefully get to try some daily specials."
ChIJ_Tki6XsoQg0RYm66u5kmIhA,4,"A good Mexican restaurant with a huge choice of tequilas.

Given the competitiveness and choice o Mexican restaurants in Madrid, I will not give this place 5*. However, many cities in Europe would wish to have a Mexican restaurant at this level."
ChIJ_Tki6XsoQg0RYm66u5kmIhA,5,"Loved the place.
Very interesting interior, great service.
I appreciate very much the warning from the waitress, when I would have ordered too much without her help.
Great food"
ChIJ_Tki6XsoQg0RYm66u5kmIhA,5,Fantastic service and amazing food ( I can't remember the last time I had ceviche prepared to perfection like this)! Truly authentic Mexican cuisine!  A breathe of fresh air to walk into this restaurant that felt like walking into a relative's home to enjoy a wonderful meal.  Would most definitely come again!
ChIJ_Tki6XsoQg0RYm66u5kmIhA,5,"This place is great. I read other reviews and some people think that this place is expensive for being a Mexican restaurant. Well, obviously that people could go better to one of this sad chains and leave this restaurant for people who actually expect real food. The service is really good, the food presentation is plenty of details and the food is really tasty. They have a good wine selection btw."
ChIJe7gH-nooQg0RTAsEm39GkeY,5,"The best meat restaurant ever.
Love the food. The staff is kind and notice the tables if someone need something.
I love coming here every time I visit Madrid.
If you like to eat meat, this is the place to come to."
ChIJe7gH-nooQg0RTAsEm39GkeY,5,"I was very content with this restaurant.
The servers were very kind and asked me understanding of his poor English, but it was fairly enough to take an order and to show his hospitality.
The interior was neat and the atmosphere was not that loud but in ease.
There are two things you should remember.
1. Bread, cheese and butter are not complimentary but served.
2. There is minimum quantity of ordering loin, which is 350g.
Anyway, I was very pleased to have plentiful dinner."
ChIJe7gH-nooQg0RTAsEm39GkeY,5,The restaurant was unexpectedly good! The beef here was one of the best beef I had ever tried in Euro! The experience is so unique and good! I highly recommended this restaurant and the staffs here are all professional and friendly.
ChIJe7gH-nooQg0RTAsEm39GkeY,5,Great place for a business lunch. Good service and better food.
ChIJe7gH-nooQg0RTAsEm39GkeY,1,Horrible food. Not good service. So expensive for nothing.  We r so disappointed üòû
ChIJKTA6gmUoQg0R4yQo6VrLVV0,5,"The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the waiters have been very friendly and nice with us. The food was fine and the portions were good.
The bathroom was clean as well as the restaurant. I would only suggest to specify the ingredients of the dishes because it was difficult for me to understand what plate I was eating. Despite that, the atmosphere was wonderful!!"
ChIJKTA6gmUoQg0R4yQo6VrLVV0,4,"It is a cute place. The food is mediocre. I like the soup. (It is called aztec or something). Very hearty chicken soup with a bit of sourness from the lime. The tacos are not that great. If you are having a menu del dia i recomend getting something else altough the rice that was served with the meat for the taco was so delicious. The taco shells are dry and tasteless. The service is so slow like so so slow. If you are a person who enjoys the food slowly, it is perfect for you."
ChIJKTA6gmUoQg0R4yQo6VrLVV0,4,"The sopa azteca was absolutely amazing it blew me away! The birria tacos were good, but it came with such a little amount of consom√© which was very disappointing. The nachos and guacamole were also pretty good and the tres leche cake was insanely good! Great spot for Mexican food in Madrid!!! Service was kinda slow but not the worst."
ChIJKTA6gmUoQg0R4yQo6VrLVV0,5,The place is so cozy and the food is delicious. The Fajitas were the highlight. So good. Staff also very friendly and very helpful.
ChIJKTA6gmUoQg0R4yQo6VrLVV0,5,"A friend of mine recommended this restaurant last-minute, and I'm so happy we went in instead of the other place we had planned! It was my first time trying Mexican cuisine, and I loved it! üá≤üáΩ

The place is spacious, colorful, and the menu is available via a QR code stuck to every table. Not sure if there's an English version (we couldn't find it), but we made do with the Spanish one and Google Translate.

My friend had recommended the nachos with guacamole and YES, you should try them too! We also had quesadilla with chicken and gringa with spicy meat. The individual portions aren't big, but those for sharing are great.

The staff were super friendly and communicated well in English which saved us a lot of embarrassment. Thank you so much for that!!

‚ôø Entry and dining space is accessible, but unfortunately the toilets were down a flight of stairs.

üí≥ You can pay by card.

Overall, really recommend!"
ChIJj3AECHAoQg0RqUVHB_F9RYk,5,"Amazing place! We had our lunch from here way back in September 2024, the ambience is too good, really great set up and vibes. Food was top notch, wanted to try out some Spanish cuisine and was not disappointed, food quantity was also great and all dishes were brilliant! Only thing was language to converse, none of the waiters knew English, so it was difficult for us, the restaurant thought that we were having trouble and they gave our dessert on the house! Absolutely amazed by the service. I recommend everyone visiting Madrid to go here once! You wouldn't be disappointed üòÄüëèüèª"
ChIJj3AECHAoQg0RqUVHB_F9RYk,5,"Great Paella! Refreshing Sangria! Complimentary aperitif was delicious! Excellent service! Complimentary Cava a class act! Eric,Luis and Judith were outstanding! Should definitely give this place a try!üëç"
ChIJj3AECHAoQg0RqUVHB_F9RYk,5,"I had an incredible dining experience here! The paella was absolutely delicious‚Äîperfectly cooked rice with rich flavors and fresh ingredients. And the cheesecake? Easily one of the best I‚Äôve ever had‚Äîcreamy, smooth, and full of flavor.

A special thanks to Francisco, who made our experience even better. He was kind, attentive, and truly made us feel welcome. Exceptional service from start to finish! Highly recommend this place for both the food and the hospitality. Will definitely be coming back!"
ChIJj3AECHAoQg0RqUVHB_F9RYk,5,"From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality. Our meal was a gastronomic journey with each dish expertly prepared and bursting with flavors that tantalized our taste buds. The ambiance was cozy and inviting, perfect for a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable, enhancing our overall enjoyment of the evening. Overall, our visit to [Restaurant Name] was a delightful culinary experience that we will surely be returning for. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a memorable dining experience!"
ChIJj3AECHAoQg0RqUVHB_F9RYk,5,"We had a wonderful lunch at Dudua Palacio! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious‚Äîespecially the huevos rotos con gambas, ensaladilla rusa, and gambas al ajillo. The flavors were fresh and authentic. Our server √ìscar was outstanding‚Äîattentive, friendly, and made us feel very welcome. Excellent service and great food all around. Highly recommend!"
ChIJf4_VhXsoQg0RIIPiAlAds4s,5,"Celebrating St. Patrick's Day with friends at the pub was such a great time! The staff are super friendly, and the prices for drinks and food are definitely reasonable. We even got to enjoy some fun stand-up shows. Just a heads-up: the place can get pretty crowded, so it's a good idea to keep a hold of your beer to prevent any spills while you navigate through the crowd. Overall, it was a fantastic experience!"
ChIJf4_VhXsoQg0RIIPiAlAds4s,2,"For people that book language exchange through Eventbrite, be careful.

I went for one last Friday (28/03) at 5:30, saw no one and asked one of the waiter if there‚Äôs an activity going on. While I was trying to explain and show him the App where it says Beer Station with address. He used Google translate and said: We do not have any language exchange activity here, if you book with someone, go find that person.
While I was reading all this he suddenly pulled away his phone and walk back to the bar without saying anything.

I completely understand that is my own issue with the event organizar. What I felt weird about was he wasn‚Äôt feeling weird at all about someone came in and ask for an activity where their bar was used as the gathering point.

I have never been to this bar before so I actually checked Google comments before going. There are some comments mentioned about language exchange, some from years ago, some says it‚Äôs only Thursday & Saturday.

Overall I had a rude guy handled this impatiently and a bit suspiciously.

Update to the owner or whoever responded to my comment: I believe I have the date very clearly stated in my previous notes. As you can see it was 28th of Match, 5:30 PM. The waiter who spoke rudely with me was a man with dark, curly hair, glasses with black frame and was wearing a simple black T- shirt. If you guys do host language gathering, I had no idea why your staff would deliver such a message."
ChIJf4_VhXsoQg0RIIPiAlAds4s,5,"Madrid Mini Break, following on from our weekend in Porto. 11/08/24. Our first beer stop here at Beer Station. Great place, good atmosphere and quite a lot of beer choice. Mainly bottles, but quite a bit of craft beer/craft ale on tap too. The Lagunitas IPA is gassy but well crafted and one I've had before. A good flavour. The Murphy's Irish Red was good too! 3 days left so I know we'll back back tomorrow!"
ChIJf4_VhXsoQg0RIIPiAlAds4s,4,"Watched the Real Madrid v Arsenal game here with family. Book a table in advance, international crowd. Food was average but perfect menu for watching the football."
ChIJf4_VhXsoQg0RIIPiAlAds4s,1,"If you are foreigner you are not welcome in this pub, when they understand that you are not spanish you wait in front of the bar and the waiter just ignore you. ( 20 mins with no one else waiting to order)
When you try to speak spanish he is laughing at you and when you ask in english he answers just ' No'
So i didn't had my drink just because of a racist waiter
I don't recommand"
ChIJ4Zs8bGwoQg0RJTM4hXYIRmw,5,"La Creperie is a very relaxing place to enjoy a cr√™pe, located just next to Parque del Oeste with a big terraceüå≥‚òïÔ∏è. They have 50+ options. I had the Breakfast cr√™pe last time (cheese, bacon, and eggü•ûüßÄü•ìüç≥). I have been living in the neighborhood for almost six years and they have always been here (I think around 35 or 40 years now). ü•Çüçªü•óüßÄAlso if you just want to have a coffee, cold wine, beer, salad, or some cheeses and pat√©s, they have it. Friendly staff and a relaxing boulevard overlooking the green area.üçÉü¶ú‚òÄÔ∏èüòä"
ChIJ4Zs8bGwoQg0RJTM4hXYIRmw,3,Nice crepes both savoury and sweet. Good for grabbing an easy lunch. Kids enjoy the different options. Nothing spectacular but the place has been running more than 30 years but they have manage to keep a continuous stream of recurring customers that is an statement on itself.
ChIJ4Zs8bGwoQg0RJTM4hXYIRmw,3,"Not great, pricey.

Two crepes, two beers and an extra egg was ‚Ç¨32. Food was bland. Service forgot the add-on and had to be asked for."
ChIJ4Zs8bGwoQg0RJTM4hXYIRmw,5,"I stopped here when I was near the Debod Temple, and was blown away! Their crepes are delicious, I got the Ingles and the Jam crepe. They were so light, but still filling. I also got a glass of wine as I ate on the patio. One thing I didn‚Äôt expect was an up charge for eating outside, but it was totally worth it! After he brought me my check, my server brought me a complimentary shot of a cream liquor that was delicious! Would definitely visit again, and I will seek out a creperie in the US!"
ChIJ4Zs8bGwoQg0RJTM4hXYIRmw,5,Service is very kind. Perfect amount of food. The Roma crepe is delicious.
ChIJMczvIHooQg0RGwDsexuLD8Y,5,"We arrived at the restaurant 30 minutes before kitchen opens but Consu seated us within 5 minutes.

The real deal was that Consu was able to accommodate dinner ordering to our preferences. All dishes came out great.

We will be leaving Madrid with good memories. Thanks Consu."
ChIJMczvIHooQg0RGwDsexuLD8Y,3,"Great atmosphere. It's extremely cozy. Unfortunately the hotel breakfast deal is no good. Jamon made me sick, the eggs are strange, and the toast is never toasted. It's also served with ice cold butter. Even the cafe con Leche is subpar."
ChIJMczvIHooQg0RGwDsexuLD8Y,5,Great historical and traditional place where the people are so kind and everything is so delicious ....try
ChIJMczvIHooQg0RGwDsexuLD8Y,5,"Service was great. Food was exceptional,beautiful presentation everyone was attentive and professional"
ChIJMczvIHooQg0RGwDsexuLD8Y,5,"With Royal Palace in view when we dined, price was higher for a good reason.

We enjoyed our outdoor seating, weather was chilly but with heaters around us, it was an unique experience.

Scrumptious food was elegantly presented. People watch when sipping wines. Wrapped up meal with yummy Irish coffee.

Will recommend."
ChIJT_sV2HsoQg0R9aqOvyI1pT0,3,Ordered cheeseburger with only ketchup and pickles and a Caesar salad without bacon.  The kids meal came out first and bacon was on it with no pickles.  The salad took forever to come out and my child was almost finished.  When the salad did come out it had bacon on it and I explicitly and repeatedly told them that I didn't want bacon.  They offered to fix it but we had been there for a while and was ready to go.
ChIJT_sV2HsoQg0R9aqOvyI1pT0,5,"The food here is amazing especially the chicken quesadillas were delicious. We also had chicken tacos and they were good too. The brownie was also tasty, a bit on the sweeter side. Omar, who waited our table was so considerate and patient. We ordered something we didn't want (we oversaw the ingredients and didn't notice there was bacon in it and we don't eat that) , but Omar took care of it and let us order something else and cancelled the previous order. He was amazing. Excellent service. Recommended üëç"
ChIJT_sV2HsoQg0R9aqOvyI1pT0,3,"The food was fine, the service wasn‚Äôt the best partly because of the language barrier since they don‚Äôt know english bht they did try their best to understand us and were kind to us, but also we had to order a cup for 7 times until it came because they weren‚Äôt the most organized and the place wasn‚Äôt clean"
ChIJT_sV2HsoQg0R9aqOvyI1pT0,1,"Worst dining experience we had in Spain. Service was terrible, slow, even when there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. Food quality was mediocre at best and waiter was not attentive. Food received was not as ordered. Restaurant was dirty. Don't waste your time or money."
ChIJT_sV2HsoQg0R9aqOvyI1pT0,4,"Paqui was very nice and the service was perfect with her
I recommend this site"
ChIJKZcC4HsoQg0REu8YEvIh_H8,3,"I was excited to try authentic Spanish cuisine‚Äînot just tapas, but a proper Spanish meal. Unfortunately, I have mixed feelings about this place. Overall, I found it overpriced, with small portions. The meat was served with fries‚Äîare fries really a staple of Spanish cuisine? The lamb chops and veal were overly salty, making them hard to enjoy. Service was just okay; I ordered two different types of wine, but they poured the same one into both glasses. The atmosphere had potential, but the plastic bags on the windows took away from the experience."
ChIJKZcC4HsoQg0REu8YEvIh_H8,5,"Wanted to try out the suckling pig dish and found this place after a bit of searching. The food was great. Very juicy meat and crunchy on the outside.
The service was OK, the waitresses could greet people much better, in my case they were a bit too serious. But no problems what so ever, and I liked the restaurant quite a lot."
ChIJKZcC4HsoQg0REu8YEvIh_H8,5,"We loved everything about the food, from the consomm√©, pork rind, pimientas de padr√≥n, to roasted peppers and our slow roasted lamb. We spent about ‚Ç¨90 for three people, and that‚Äôs with beverages. It‚Äôs very good value for a phenomenal meal, tasty. Each time I am in Madrid I‚Äôd come. On my last visit we had pata negra which was also amazing."
ChIJKZcC4HsoQg0REu8YEvIh_H8,4,"The dining experience offers a delightful array of options to please any palate. However, while waiting for our orders, we were served appetizers that we did not order, and we assumed they were complimentary.  We were surprised to find that three sets of these appetizers were included on our bill. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÖüò¢"
ChIJKZcC4HsoQg0REu8YEvIh_H8,4,"Ordered the octopus, suckling pig and grilled sea bass. The sea bass was delectable and of a reasonable price. The suckling pig was juicy and tender, melting in your mouth with a crispy top. Unfortunately the octopus did not meet expectations as we found it to be too soft and lacked chew. Nonetheless, a enjoyable experience"
ChIJv-8FjHooQg0RCae_-xvEb4w,5,Their bread is the best bread I‚Äôve ever had!!!! And the steak is just perfect!!!!!! Foie caliente also killed it ü•∞ü•∞
ChIJv-8FjHooQg0RCae_-xvEb4w,5,"You want a good place to eat to enjoy the perfect Madrid summer air? This place is so perfect! The food is the best in town! The location is in a quiet and nice street! You have to sit outside!!! But if you sit inside, you‚Äôll find a super cool 1920s aesthetic! Take a picture sin the bathroom because the walls are so cool!  The staff is friendly and extremely attentive! YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE MUSSELS!!! The sangria is 10/10 and the beer is cold and delicious!
The specials are affordable and amazing quality!"
ChIJv-8FjHooQg0RCae_-xvEb4w,5,Food has been phenomenal. Everything was fresh and special. Our waiter Esther has been very accomodating and smiling.
ChIJv-8FjHooQg0RCae_-xvEb4w,5,"The food, the attention, the ambiance. Couldn‚Äôt be more perfect. It really worth the price.

P.D. You really have to give it a try to the ‚ÄúMagret de Pato‚Äù, is just magic in a pan."
ChIJv-8FjHooQg0RCae_-xvEb4w,5,This was a nice little gem that we stumbled upon. The food was amazing! The service was excellent.
ChIJ1-PMBm8oQg0R4spWwHHGHBQ,5,"RECOMMENDED!
Excellent meat, great service, and good price.
Really enjoyed the Xuleton and tarta de queso. Very kind service and felt welcome.
I would come back and recommend."
ChIJ1-PMBm8oQg0R4spWwHHGHBQ,5,"Got a menu that typically is for 4, but the waiter was kind enough to do for 2 (~$50/person). Enough food to kill your hunger for the whole day. Highlight was the bacalao tortilla (COD omelette) and the cheesecake. Everything was among the best I'd had in the category. By the time the steak came we were crushed but still ate what we could. House Rioja was a perfect compliment."
ChIJ1-PMBm8oQg0R4spWwHHGHBQ,5,Food is AMAZING.  From anchovies to omelet to desert.  Had to try their cider. U won‚Äôt regret
ChIJ1-PMBm8oQg0R4spWwHHGHBQ,5,"Food is excellent and the staff is super friendly (not sure if they speak English). You can order a la cart or choose one of their ""menus"" (prices from 30 to 50 Eur per menu). We choose the menu option, and we couldn't finish...too much food (you won't starve). I think price vs quantity/quality
makes it worth the visit. Make sure to make a reservation,  this place is very popular among locals."
ChIJ1-PMBm8oQg0R4spWwHHGHBQ,4,"Nice traditional sidrer√≠a, the restaurant has quite a large space but it was mostly empty, so it felt a bit awkward eating there. The chulet√≥n is a great value for money (44‚Ç¨ for 2 people) coming with fries, salad and either a bottle of wine or cider. Pictured is chulet√≥n for 3."
ChIJKTA6gmUoQg0RM3I7oKiuHT4,5,Good McDonald's food. The place is not packed and nice to sit. The workers work quickly
ChIJKTA6gmUoQg0RM3I7oKiuHT4,2,"The breakfast muffins were always mushy and I chose to have my food brought to the table but I waited for over 10 minutes and no one came! I went to the front desk and I saw my food was just sitting there and no one was serving it, I waited for several minutes before someone came out to fix the problem‚Ä¶And it's really slow. If you can choose other places to have breakfast, don't choose this place! If it weren't for the muffins, I wouldn't come here... the ones in gran via and sol are way much better than here"
ChIJKTA6gmUoQg0RM3I7oKiuHT4,1,Worst mcD I‚Äôve ever been to. Slow service. staff don‚Äôt give a shit. Disappointed!
ChIJKTA6gmUoQg0RM3I7oKiuHT4,3,Not as good like other Macdonald outlets. I ordered Capuchina (take away) and they simply placed cup with a mixing stick on their delivery table which was dirty. Didn‚Äôt bothered to wrap stick with tissue paper or to deliver in tray. Restaurant was dirty. No consideration of hygiene.
ChIJKTA6gmUoQg0RM3I7oKiuHT4,2,Deliberately small servings. Mostly on cakes from the Mc  Cafe. The overall presentation of the burger could be better.
ChIJBXxJdm8oQg0R4_BT8tFfGUs,5,"Excellent cuisine in Basque Country Style. Sophisticated compositions, high quality ingredients and friendly recommendations make this restaurant a perfect spot to dine in Madrid near Plaza Espana. Very reasonable price/performance relation."
ChIJBXxJdm8oQg0R4_BT8tFfGUs,5,"Wonderful food, wonderful service (just exemplary!). I cannot recommend it more highly. From the starter, main to the coffee with delicious sweet! The fish in particular is so good here. Thanks for such a great experience."
ChIJBXxJdm8oQg0R4_BT8tFfGUs,5,"Amazing food, great ambience, and some of the best service I've had in Madrid. We ate fresh artichoke, sizzling prawns, the monkfish, clams in green sauce, fried anchovies and the white chocolate mousse. Absolutely delicious. Barona wine was also phenomenal!"
ChIJBXxJdm8oQg0R4_BT8tFfGUs,5,Unbelievably good restaurant with a wide and varied menu. Highly recommend the Txangurro crab head and the Panchineta de Hojaldre puff pastry dessert.
ChIJBXxJdm8oQg0R4_BT8tFfGUs,5,"Delicious food. Kind, helpful staff. Great dining experience.

I told my waiter that I was visiting the area and wanted his recommendations on dishes to have an authentic dining experience at the restaurant, and he was more than happy to give me several recommendations. Everything was very tasty, and the staff were patient with me as I practiced my Spanish."
ChIJeWari28oQg0Rp-IUyogmk30,5,Sat for a few hours with friends and shared a few drinks. Was less than ‚Ç¨10 and was brought chips and nuts continuously throughout! Will be returning ü•∞
ChIJeWari28oQg0Rp-IUyogmk30,5,"Pros
Taste! We got red wine, Dulche de leche crepe and egg/ham crepe
Price (seems cheap as an Australian)
Okay decor

Cons
Presentation was average
The toilet room is very narrow. Hard to squeeze to close the door
Half way below ground. Only a little natural light"
ChIJeWari28oQg0Rp-IUyogmk30,1,Not a place for ordering a hot cocoa in Madrid (Chocolate a la Taza)... Too sugary
ChIJeWari28oQg0Rp-IUyogmk30,5,"Had a delightful experience here. Met some friends for drinks, very cost effective, great service, definitely recommend."
ChIJeWari28oQg0Rp-IUyogmk30,5,Amazing delicious food. I enjoy their menu every time I visit Madrid. The owner and stuff are very friendly and nice. I recommend it to everyone.
ChIJq7CeMXooQg0RYsiugDCHkKQ,4,"Bel careful when ordering every little thing is charged, even you don't order and they claim to ""offer"".  Each fench fry brick is charged). We were 3 people. That being said, the food is good."
ChIJq7CeMXooQg0RYsiugDCHkKQ,4,Sat here for a drink on 1st May 2025 between 22:00-23:30 and had a pleasant time but unfortunately our bag got stolen which had our camera in so we lost all our holiday pictures. Servers were apologetic though. If anyone finds a blue Nikon Coolpix w100 (it was in a children‚Äôs animal bag) please let me know
ChIJq7CeMXooQg0RYsiugDCHkKQ,5,"Our hotel concierge recommend this restaurant. We had the most wonderful lunch during our stay in Madrid. The server explained in every detail each and every item we requested, and provided background on its regional origins. We ate at the restaurant upstairs, with a spectacular view of the Royal Palace. The cold items came out perfectly prepared and presented, and the fish entre were at perfect temperature.
The meal was memorable!!"
ChIJq7CeMXooQg0RYsiugDCHkKQ,2,"I was allowed to go to the toilet without being a customer so I thought I stay for a drink since they were so nice.
The waiter then took quite some time.  Fine, I thought, it's Spain. But as he asked me what I wanted and I asked for the card he answered, they don't have a card. I repeated, they wouldn't have a card?!?! Then he said, ""we have wine, beer.."". I felt very unwelcome and confused. He would not clean the table, 3 leftover drinks sat with me for most of my stay.
Honestly, I have NEVER posted a google review before but this was so UNRESPECTFUL, like I have to beg for a service I pay for in a restaurant they offer to serve you. I should have left as he said they wouldn't have a card!!
I understand it is a stressful job and customers can be mean, but that sort of service ruins a day of a holiday of people who have worked for it.
Anyhow, left him a tip, stupid me.
Thanks for the lesson."
ChIJq7CeMXooQg0RYsiugDCHkKQ,5,"It's really a seafood restaurant, but I was in the mood for a burger. Wasn't the best I'd had but meat was high quality and fries were really nice. Given a bowl of nuts when seated at the table. Staff was very friendly and spoke English. Wine by the glass was decent. The location and view are very relaxing compared to most of the city with great outdoor seating. An artist was painting the area while I ate lunch."
ChIJvXMGkm4oQg0R6Qvj_jCo1p8,5,Asked for the guy to choose for me the best recommended in the menu. All were winners. Will come back
ChIJvXMGkm4oQg0R6Qvj_jCo1p8,5,"Family owned hidden gem! Catch the sunset nearby at Debod Temple. Get the canned goods, fresh foie gras, jamon, stewed snails, and out-of-this-world toasts topped with bone marrow, eel and shrimp! A MUST HAVE IS THE BLACK TRUFFLE RISOTTO - out of this world!"
ChIJvXMGkm4oQg0R6Qvj_jCo1p8,5,"Amazing - really great wine bar! Superb wines. Really should check it out if you‚Äôre in the neighborhood

Had to come back‚Ä¶ great wines recommended"
ChIJvXMGkm4oQg0R6Qvj_jCo1p8,5,Stopped in here at random and so glad we did.  I was hoping for an Amontillado and the bar tender turned me onto Oloroso.  He had great knowledge of wine and sherry.  Seemed to be a local place.  There were no linens on the table and no tables outdoors when we were there (different from other posts) but I can see it is the same venue.  We had one tapas that came with our drinks and it was much better than many we had in other places around Madrid.  I‚Äôd absolutely go back.
ChIJvXMGkm4oQg0R6Qvj_jCo1p8,5,"Amazing classic Spanish restaurant.
Get the tu√©tano, the buey and the milhojas cake.

The tu√©tano was my favorite and would come back for it"
ChIJlbdxF4coQg0RPMm5Up35n88,5,Five stars five stars five stars. For ‚Ç¨14 you get salads meats desserts drinks ice cream? Great service great atmosphere? Why nobody told me this is a must visit place in Madrid! Was here afternoon. There were many people but no line.
ChIJlbdxF4coQg0RPMm5Up35n88,5,"What a great place.  Incredible value.  The host was very nice at explaining the concept and how it works.  First alcoholic drink is free and then unlimited other beverages.  Salad bar was delicious, lots of desserts and the hot section was decent.  For the price you cannot go wrong.  This place was BUSY during the dinner time and groups of school children groups came in one after another.  I was stuffed, happy and satisified."
ChIJlbdxF4coQg0RPMm5Up35n88,5,"If you are visiting Madrid and looking for a food with less price and of more varieties then you should definitely visit this place.

The quality of the food is great (what else can we expect for the price of 12.95‚Ç¨). The buffet includes drinks as well for free. There‚Äôs a wide range of salats and deserts. The taste of the Pizza is too good that we can compare it with Dominos. It‚Äôs definitely worth for each and every penny (If you‚Äôre a tourist and wanna fill up your belly).

Just enter the restaurant and enjoy the food :)"
ChIJlbdxF4coQg0RPMm5Up35n88,5,"Excellent value for money. All the hot dishes I had were well seasoned, and with bottomless (soft) drinks included, you can hardly go wrong! I did have a small communication issue with the grill-to-order staff, which was sorted out quickly."
ChIJlbdxF4coQg0RPMm5Up35n88,5,"Inexpensive buffet meal, perfect downtown location, good food and freshly made. Awesome value for money. Unlimited drinks included."
ChIJ1a8RlnsoQg0RmlQ4FvOyJeQ,5,Very good chinese food! Value for the money and cozy ambiance.
ChIJ1a8RlnsoQg0RmlQ4FvOyJeQ,5,"Great place for hotpot. The flavours are amazing. Service is super great. I suggest going with a big group of friends, eating family style and enjoying the cuisine."
ChIJ1a8RlnsoQg0RmlQ4FvOyJeQ,5,Very pleasant experience. The female boss is running in the hall and male boss is behind the counter ( I guess he is the chef).   Both of them are very hospitable and nice. Food is delicious and overall environment is cozy and clean. Prices is also quite friendly.
ChIJ1a8RlnsoQg0RmlQ4FvOyJeQ,5,"Pretty good location, close to Opera metro station and Royal palace. 10.5 euros for a buffet lunch on sunday is a very good deal. You can also choose to have your own dish fried in the wok on the spot from your selected ingredients."
ChIJ1a8RlnsoQg0RmlQ4FvOyJeQ,5,"Very nice cosy restaurant. Good food, great service. ‚Ç¨10.50 per person for all you can eat."
ChIJxbOIxXsoQg0R29Sz24nuTR0,5,"Stumbled on this quaint place while looking for a place to grab some paella on Valentine's Day.  The paella was absolutely delicious and was super glad that we found La Paella Real. Arrived soon as they opened and was able to get seated without a reservation.  The timing was perfect as people started coming in afterward.  Ordered the special which included starters (grilled squid, salad and olives), a chocolate dessert and a pitcher of sangria.  Everything was superb including the service. Would've easily paid more but super great value!"
ChIJxbOIxXsoQg0R29Sz24nuTR0,3,"We had our early dinner here, started with break, served sanglia beverages and white wine. The squid was decent and the leftovers oil used to dipped into the bread. Mushrooms was a bit salty and the cheese ball not my favourite. The rice was flavourful."
ChIJxbOIxXsoQg0R29Sz24nuTR0,5,"This my first time in Madrid and the receptionist of my hotel, tip me to come to this restaurant to taste a nice paella! I saw some others reviews saying things that I think are not true. The waiter really professional and kind, gave us an exceptional service! The restaurant has a short menu, but it's because the plates you find are really nice! If you come to Madrid please visit La Paella Real!"
ChIJxbOIxXsoQg0R29Sz24nuTR0,4,"We ordered the Chicken and Vegetable, Black bean and Prawn Paella and the grillef squid started...and watched it quickly disappear! Great introduction to Spain for my husband's first visit.

I cannot remember the wine ordered but I'll tell ya...my husband is not a wine drinker but order plenty bottles! Lol thank you for finally making a Spanish wine lover out of him!!"
ChIJxbOIxXsoQg0R29Sz24nuTR0,2,"When we lived in Madrid years ago, this was always the best place for paella and great service. Sadly, this is no longer true. The service was horrible. We made a reservation for two of us. Upon entering, the servers rudely assumed we did not have a reservation and even when told there was a reservation, they did not really want to give us a table for two. They are only looking for larger groups from tour busses or their regular local customers, who I saw received excellent service. Their bill was much larger than our 60 Euro bill.

The paella was really good, but not what you‚Äôd expect from La Paella Real! I ordered a glass of house white wine and it was not on par with what you‚Äôd expect from excellent Spanish Albori√±o wine.

Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for real paella, I‚Äôd opt to go somewhere else with much better customer service, wine, and food."
ChIJQxD0PGwoQg0RTMUyr1OPlOI,1,"The food was ok, but to charge 22 ‚Ç¨ for 9 small bread pieces is ridiculous. Also 237 mL of coke for 4.50 ‚Ç¨. They charged us 9 times the cutlery, although we were 6 persons. Just a scam!"
ChIJQxD0PGwoQg0RTMUyr1OPlOI,5,"Excellent service and atmosphere. All food dishes were fantastic, especially the homemade pate and salmon cheese wraps. Carpaccio dish was a bit bland though. Rabo de toro canelo is also really tasty."
ChIJQxD0PGwoQg0RTMUyr1OPlOI,5,"Close to Almodovar's home, this place has elegance and style. It caters to an older clientele but but is not stuffy."
ChIJQxD0PGwoQg0RTMUyr1OPlOI,5,"A really nice place even only for a Drink
The bartender is a gentleman and the service is good
A little bit expensive but would recommend to stop"
ChIJQxD0PGwoQg0RTMUyr1OPlOI,5,grandmas ratatouille with eggs was superb and different and the sea bass ceviche was outstanding.  service was friendly and attentive
ChIJCRHUzGQoQg0R5mfKfGToFNg,5,"This was probably the #1 meal my husband and I had in Madrid.

It was a bit hard to find because the directions Google maps gives you are so confusing‚Ä¶ but just look for the theatre and make a right on that corner.

We came around noon and was seated immediately by an older guy. He was so chill and friendly - showed us all the famous people who visited the establishment and told us a little bit about the restaurant how this is their oldest branch but they do have 5 other affiliated restaurants.

We got the bar menu items - chorizo/empanada,steaks, flan, panacota, and beer. Everything was super flavourful and the steaks were so tender. We savoured each bite and could not get enough.

Dessert was also top notch - hubby loves panacotta and im more so into flan so we shared the dessert and it was the perfect end to our meal!

Super affordable‚Ä¶ we were surprised how great the deal was for such an amazing meal!"
ChIJCRHUzGQoQg0R5mfKfGToFNg,1,"The worst experience at this restaurant. Start from entering the restaurant with the waitress who attended us. I assumed that she was lack of training and manners to work in a fine dining restaurant.  when we ask for a table she just simply said wait here! so casual. while I was waiting for they prepared a table. I observed how they prepared the beer for customer the beer and foam was over the glass and fell down on the side instead of cleaning the glass, they took it to serve customers just like a street bar.  when It comes to our dining experience, everything was like in a rush. rush talking rush taking order, rush serving and rush cooking. the food that my couple order was a beef steak, he ordered for medium well for the steak and surprisingly when it served, it was almost burn from outside and in the middle was so red with blood, He tried to get attention of the waiter to check the food with him however nobody pay attention and he had to walk to get their attention.  He waited on the table for sometime, the waiter still did not come to our table, he decided to start having it which he did not enjoy that much. Later when the waiter appeared, My couple made a comment regarding about the attention that he received, there was no apology no offered to change or fix the dish which even show more how professional they are and the service that we received. A whole dining, they never ask about the customer experience. I would not recommend this place as it is over rated."
ChIJCRHUzGQoQg0R5mfKfGToFNg,5,"It was perfect! The price, the portion, the location, the food was very good and the stuff was also very frendly! üòãüëçüèº‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJCRHUzGQoQg0R5mfKfGToFNg,3,"they served good steak, although the prawn salad we ordered came out smelling fishy and unfresh. the staff allowed us to reject and cancel the order which was nice of them, although we wonder why the kitchen chefs still decided to serve the dish when the smell was so obvious"
ChIJCRHUzGQoQg0R5mfKfGToFNg,5,Absolutly best restaurant. Very nice service. Excellent food. And a lot of ‚Äûon the house‚Äú gestures. I enjoyed it!!!
ChIJmfJelm4oQg0R3-KZLEhGXNI,5,"Txirimiri Ferraz is not just about great food; it also offers an attractive price point and lovely decor, which have contributed to its positive reputation among locals and visitors alike. With a Google rating of 4.4 stars, it's clear that Txirimiri Ferraz has successfully captured the hearts of its diners. We order two delicious meals and desserts which I recommend you!"
ChIJmfJelm4oQg0R3-KZLEhGXNI,5,"One of the best meals I‚Äôve had in Spain!
The artichokes melted in your mouth. We also got a goat cheese salad as a starter.
I had a lightly fried cod with white wine. Everything we ordered was delicious that night, and we came with a large group.

I cannot wait to come back again soon !"
ChIJmfJelm4oQg0R3-KZLEhGXNI,4,The food was absolutely amazing with a few fusion dishes. There was only two of us so we could not order and experience a lot of dishes. What I enjoy is that this restaurant is not very touristy. We had some great conversations with some locals sitting next to our table. I would have given this restaurant a five star had a waiter not been so cool to us at the beginning.
ChIJmfJelm4oQg0R3-KZLEhGXNI,5,"We had an excellent Sunday night dinner here. The croquettas were the best we‚Äôve ever had- delicious flavours. The burger, beef and tempura cod were all fantastic as mains. The restaurant had a nice local buzz. Friendly service. Highly recommended."
ChIJmfJelm4oQg0R3-KZLEhGXNI,5,"So good I ate there twice! I knew this needed to be my last meal in Madrid and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do without this restaurant! Now that I know all about croqueta can be, I am ruined forever. I would go back to Madrid again just to eat there. My only regret is not trying more things but the croqueta sampler was so good I had to have it again.

The staff was super kind and helpful, especially when it came to picking out a wine to pair well with the meal. The restaurant is also super close to lots of neat sites so you can enjoy your meal and then walk it off with some beautiful sites."
ChIJsegs6XsoQg0RHuYq_CC6JtY,5,"We stumbled upon this magnificent restaurant after a concert at the Berlin Cafe. Despite not having a reservation and a full house, Bruno and Trini made us feel welcome and squeezed us in. The food was delicious, the service impeccable. Thank you!"
ChIJsegs6XsoQg0RHuYq_CC6JtY,2,"Such a good rating is a mistery. The food is below average. The pizza crust was soggy, the ingredients were low quality.

It‚Äôs not something you expect from a 4.6 rating intalian restaurant."
ChIJsegs6XsoQg0RHuYq_CC6JtY,4,This place is as authentic Italian as I have found here in Madrid! I highly recommend it and will be back. The place is simple and the food is excellent! We ordered the Bucatini alla Matriciana and they were delicious. The other plate was the ‚ÄúSpaghetti ai Frutti di Mare‚Äù al cartoccio. Really delicious as well. They have a pistachio dessert tart that was to kill for and I don‚Äôt like sweets. Their Tiramisu was also very good. Decent prices and good atmosphere. Very close to Opera at the heart of Madrid.
ChIJsegs6XsoQg0RHuYq_CC6JtY,5,"Genuine Italian restaurant in the heart of Madrid with good variety of pasta and pizza.
One of the best Italian food we have ever tried in a very cozy place and friendly staff.

Remember to book in advance since it has limited space.

We were lucky to hear great voice of the owner singing a song for the guests.

Highly recommended."
ChIJsegs6XsoQg0RHuYq_CC6JtY,5,We went for a team lunch. Delicious authentic Italian food. Overwhelmed with varieties and taste!
ChIJRWe9LXsoQg0RisTyf7RTznU,5,"We have been going to this fabulous place since 1917. It is as beautiful as ever. The staff and Service is second to none. Music area, where they perform on Friday and Sunday. The red house wine is absolutely amazing.

We are going back tomorrow."
ChIJRWe9LXsoQg0RisTyf7RTznU,4,"Nice place in the city center. The decoration is outstanding and the desserts were delicious. However, the staff needs to be more polite and helpful."
ChIJRWe9LXsoQg0RisTyf7RTznU,5,"Interesting shop with clever shop fittings using industrial equipment. I had to wait for my wife in here, so I looked around to find something of interest beyond the target suitcase collection for sale in Madrid. The good news was the background music was definitely to my taste and calming..always very welcome when I am imprisoned during my beloveded's retail therapy."
ChIJRWe9LXsoQg0RisTyf7RTznU,5,"The best restaurant that I visited in Madrid. The place is very nice ,food was super delicious and the way of presenting the dishes and drinks was innovative. I will definitely come again if I visit Madrid. However, make sure to book first since it was very busy when I go. One thing is that they don‚Äôt have English Menu so we had to use Google translate to read the menu. In the first and second floor there is a nice shop where you can shopping before or after you eat."
ChIJRWe9LXsoQg0RisTyf7RTznU,3,The only thing nice about this place is the ambience. Definitely overrated food and drinks. Overpriced and not worth the money. Description on the menu does not match the food served. A glass of pink lemonade was EUR8.00! The staff don't speak English and not very helpful either.
ChIJ12Y0nm4oQg0Rgn-aA10vdjE,2,Overpriced traditional food. Service very slow.
ChIJ12Y0nm4oQg0Rgn-aA10vdjE,5,Excellent dining!
ChIJ12Y0nm4oQg0Rgn-aA10vdjE,5,A classic place to have a good stew. The cook is an older lady who quickly reminds you of your grandmother's dishes. In addition to the cooked classic Spanish dishes to leave incredibly satisfied. Tasty dishes to dip bread in and accompany with a good wine. To top off excellent homemade desserts.
ChIJ12Y0nm4oQg0Rgn-aA10vdjE,5,"Awesome!!
We booked to eat with a large group of friends and everything was great.
There were 15 of us and they placed us in the private room downstairs, which was perfect because we were alone.
We ordered cooked for everyone and we were able to repeat it several times, they serve you the pot and until you get tired of eating, brutal.
The girl's attention was great at all times, even though we were there for almost 5 hours.
The desserts and the variety of drinks (rum, vodka, etc.) were a little lacking, but otherwise it was a success.
We will repeat for sure."
ChIJ12Y0nm4oQg0Rgn-aA10vdjE,2,"An expensive eatery
Less than ten years ago you could eat in a restaurant of this type, that is, a ""food house"", for less than 12 euros. Now, in this one they charge you 40 and you have to say that everything is very good. We have become very snobbish, really.  I don't resign. The food is good, but it is scarce and, above all, expensive;  the noisy atmosphere and the very homely treatment. In short, an expensive food house."
ChIJHQLvHWUoQg0RW7slXXjS_Cw,5,"We stopped to have something to escape the heat, and we found a place, not very big, cozy, with great service. The vegan toasts that they serve with the drinks were delicious. We will repeat for sure."
ChIJHQLvHWUoQg0RW7slXXjS_Cw,5,"We celebrated my neighbor's 50th birthday. Great place, great location, very delicious food and great price. The charming owners, helping with everything, the planning, the calculation of the food, and everything we have needed, always with a smile. We will definitely return as soon as we have an excuse to celebrate something."
ChIJHQLvHWUoQg0RW7slXXjS_Cw,5,"We celebrated our birthday recently and had a great time. The catering service is very good and the price is very good. Excellent location, behind Plaza de Espa√±a. You can also project videos, you can select the music you like through Spotify, there are tables and chairs to sit at. A highly recommended place to hold celebrations."
ChIJHQLvHWUoQg0RW7slXXjS_Cw,5,"Last February 2nd we celebrated a birthday at ""Dos Amigos"".
A great place for a celebration, in a section without noise or disturbances, with exquisite attention from Fernando and Manuela and a delicious meal that we chose following their advice and that was prepared and served to us with great professionalism and also with great care.
Thank you both very much for everything. You made it possible for our celebration to be unforgettable."
ChIJHQLvHWUoQg0RW7slXXjS_Cw,5,"We were a group of 90 people and the place was closed just for us. We chose to have dinner there and also have drinks there and the truth is that we were very happy, both for the establishment and for the staff who were very friendly at all times and were attentive to any detail that might be missing. The organization was easy thanks to the attention and availability of those responsible for the establishment.

It is an ideal place to talk to people and its three spaces make it very pleasant and you can walk from one room to the other. It is also very well located to access and then continue the party.

We will surely repeat,

Sandra"

While in the mid-high price range, La Sirena Verde delivers exceptional value for its top-tier quality and service. A must-visit for seafood lovers seeking an authentic taste of Spain in an elegant setting."
ChIJmUq6RHsoQg0Rs45h_38KnBs,4,"We ordered the oysters, shrimp, calamari, razor clams, bacalao and croquettes. Food was served fast. Service was excellent."
ChIJmUq6RHsoQg0Rs45h_38KnBs,5,"We were looking for Pulpo a la Gallega and stopped because there was a host at the door that gave us very good vibes, everything was delicious and the service was very good."
ChIJmUq6RHsoQg0Rs45h_38KnBs,3,"The service was correct due to the language barrier. Food was really not great, the razor clam was overcooked and too chewy. The black squid noodles were very salty and the shrimp and squid not super fresh. We also order the grilled shrimp, overpriced for that medium size shrimp. The only good one was the pimentos. Four dishes and one cup of cheap wine for 84‚Ç¨, rip off. Would not recommend."
ChIJmUq6RHsoQg0Rs45h_38KnBs,1,"Terrible. They first me served a dish I have not ordered, then brought me a steak that was absolutely raw inside (not even rare, just raw). I asked them to cook it a bit more and the chopped it into very thin stripes and cooked it until it was well-done and impossible to chew. My wife ordered a salad which tasted like just potatoes and mayo. In the end we found out that they already included 4‚Ç¨ of tips into the final receipt. Nobody asked if we liked the food although we didn‚Äôt even eat a half."
ChIJVeeCjHEoQg0RC06oClFh7v4,4,"A small corner joint with authentic Spanish food. Good for those with tight budgets. The servers can't speak English so be prepared to use a language translation app. The food I enjoyed most was the breakfast set comprising coffee, orange juice, bacon, bread and two sunny-side ups. The orange juice was refreshing and the sunny-side ups were done perfectly. The servers were enthusiastic. Would have given four stars for the service if the servers knew English."
ChIJVeeCjHEoQg0RC06oClFh7v4,5,Such a gem in the neighborhood! Highly recommend! The only place that opens when my jet lag kicked in üò©
ChIJVeeCjHEoQg0RC06oClFh7v4,5,"We ordered 2 glasses of red wine and got the most generous serving of blue cheese!

Might not have been the absolute best cheese,  but it was generous!"
ChIJVeeCjHEoQg0RC06oClFh7v4,3,The service was really nice & friendly. The food was pretty average and the prices okay. The dish I ordered were missing patatas which were actually on the picture of the dish I ordered.
ChIJVeeCjHEoQg0RC06oClFh7v4,5,"It deserves 5 stars, it has very local vibes, so the prices are not made for turists, and indeed you get so much for what you pay. Staff is lovely, they tried to accommodate us to their best abilities even if our spanish is not the best. Definitely a go to if you want some good local food"
ChIJa1YhQHAoQg0RslwyXzb2RfU,5,"We are a mature couple who arrived a Saturday night without reservation and got the last table. Attentive and quick servant and the beverages arrived soon. The menu card required a smartphone (QR) or access to the restaurants homepage. However, the friendy waiter will explain. We had a cheese and a cured ham plate, a combined hake fish-tortilla, water, beer, a bottle of white Rueda wine, coffee, licor pacharan, vermut. We were completely filled up and had enjoyed the whole night in this lively Spanish bar-restaurant. The price of 54 ‚Ç¨ was very fair compared to all we had enjoyed. Thanks!"
ChIJa1YhQHAoQg0RslwyXzb2RfU,5,"A real local pub and restaurant. Friendly service, excellent beer, perfect atmosphere. Strongly recommended, if you're just searching for a non-tourist place. (La Liga and hams: perfect match! :) )"
ChIJa1YhQHAoQg0RslwyXzb2RfU,5,"The best find in Madrid. Non touristy with plenty of local people having their meals here.
Great meat and cheese selection.
A must if you're in Madrid and want to experience authentic food and atmosphere"
ChIJa1YhQHAoQg0RslwyXzb2RfU,5,"Very nice local pub, excellent atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious wine! Really recommend"
ChIJa1YhQHAoQg0RslwyXzb2RfU,5,"Nice local restaurant with deli counter. Not frilly or pretentious, just good food and very reasonable prices. We came several times during our stay in Madrid and everything we tried was excellent.. Recommended"
ChIJjWTbFHAoQg0RNPO78vPpPCc,5,We had a family dinner at the restaurant. I have to say that the food and quality is beyond the expectation. The price is very fair and the portion is massive. Highly recommend.
ChIJjWTbFHAoQg0RNPO78vPpPCc,5,"It‚Äôs 20 meters away from our hotel, we stumbled to the place looking for ‚Äúgambas a ajillo‚Äù or shrimp on hot plate. Found it there, and Faber helped us with other selections. We ended up going there every night even we tried to go somewhere else but still coming back here coz the food is good, reasonable price and the service is excellent."
ChIJjWTbFHAoQg0RNPO78vPpPCc,5,"Local restaurant that serves a wide variety of food.  The mixed paella was delicious and I'm not a huge fan of clams and mussels.  I was really intrigued to try it.   The vegetable paella was also delicious.  We had calamari, potatoes with a spicy sauce, and Iberian ham.  Everything was tasty.

We used Google translate to communicate and our waiter was very accommodating.  We highly recommend this place."
ChIJjWTbFHAoQg0RNPO78vPpPCc,3,"The fried squids were somewhat raw, lacking salt and too oily, just like the French fries.
Although the atmosphere was nice, we didn‚Äôt had a pleasant experience."
ChIJjWTbFHAoQg0RNPO78vPpPCc,5,"A very nice local spanish restaurant we visited for dinner during our visit to Madrid. The lady was quiet accommodating and able to speak English. She explains the dishes and even tell us that Paella mixta consist of beef meat and offered us only with chicken meat. Prices are quiet decent, we paid 10,5‚Ç¨ for Paella and 11,5‚Ç¨ for salad.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you want to try local authentic food."
ChIJTVtcF3woQg0REKDT5Fvhaf0,5,"Really enjoyed this hotel !
Wonderfully located in such a central location but not crowded (you are tucked in on a small, lovely, local plaza).
Clean and tidy with all the necessities.
Great common room for meetings, coffees and late night drinks. And the terrace set up outside when sun comes out is SUPERB

Breakfast is extremely diverse and of great quality.
Staff is very helpful.

Gym is small and not super equipped but it does the job if you need to (dumbbells, few machines, treadmill) with a sauna too. With a little bonus view over the monastery.

I am DEFINITELY coming back next time I‚Äôm in Madrid."
ChIJTVtcF3woQg0REKDT5Fvhaf0,5,"Only good thing to say about this hotel. Location is in a safe, central area with El corte ingles department store literally next door. Metro station only a few minutes walk. Shops and restaurants all around. Room is clean and spacious and has all the necessities. We stayed during the electricity shortage and were lucky enough we were browsing the shops near the hotel. Staff are helpful. They have a contact of taxi service to the airport at 33euro fixed rate which is convenient. Highly recommend."
ChIJTVtcF3woQg0REKDT5Fvhaf0,4,"I want to preface by saying the hotel itself is really nice. Beautiful on the inside, rooms are a decent size, clean, and mostly a great location. The younger members of the staff are quick and happy to help.

The bad:

It's right next to a church. If you're jet lagged and think you might sleep in, forget it. Here are the amount of times the church bell will chime, which is about 30 meters / 100
ft from the hotel.

7:00 a.m - 7
7:30 a.m. - 1
7:42 a.m. - 8
7:53 a.m. - 81
8:00 a.m. - 8

The older members of the staff seemed to be super bothered or would outright tell you no for a simple request, then you could round the corner and ask a younger person and they would oblige immediately.

There are no microwave in the rooms.

We had house cleaning service our room and they changed everything except the sheets. A bit odd, not sure why they just wouldn't change them."
ChIJTVtcF3woQg0REKDT5Fvhaf0,5,"I enjoyed staying at this hotel very much during our stay in Madrid. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable (including the bathroom). The location is central and very walkable to many tourist sights. However, it was still quiet at night since it is not right on the main shopping street (Gran Via). I will definitely be staying again if I come back!"
ChIJTVtcF3woQg0REKDT5Fvhaf0,5,Had a great stay at this hotel! Woke up the first night with a leak but they promptly gave us a new room & breakfast! Beautiful design throughout & great location in the city!
ChIJZ8eJ5H4oQg0R0heaT0LUcx4,2,"While the property is in an excellent location, my stay was far from ideal. The staff was not welcoming, and the limited breakfast options discouraged me from purchasing it. The rooms are in dire need of renovation‚Äîwooden floors creak loudly with every step, making it impossible not to disturb others during the night. The walls are so thin that outside noise is constantly audible. Additionally, the bedroom sheets were ripped, bathroom tiles were broken or missing, and the wooden flooring had visible gaps due to poor maintenance. Overall, the experience fell short of expectations."
ChIJZ8eJ5H4oQg0R0heaT0LUcx4,2,"Unfortunately, the only good thing about the hotel is its location
1) the hotel is under renovation, the builders are working from 9 am, noisy and disturbing, no one warned us in advance! Even a discount was not made for this;
2) very small rooms in need of repair... In the shower room the hot water was not working well, there was a problem with the pressure. Also the front door to the room itself was not working well, it would not close;
3) terrible WiFi, it was not working in our room 502. When I asked the receptionist to fix this problem, he did not help at all
4) cleaning is very shoddy, the pod was constantly dirty
5) breakfast leaves much to be desired, meager choice!

If the hotel management cares, please contact me and compensate at least part of the stay!
We stayed in room 502 11.02-15.02.2025"
ChIJZ8eJ5H4oQg0R0heaT0LUcx4,5,"This is a little gem of a hotel right in the centre of Madrid.
The rooms are extremely well designed. The service at reception and at breakfast was exceptional, very friendly and thoughtful.
The bed was really comfortable, the best nights sleep I‚Äôve had in a while.
I strongly recommend this place."
ChIJZ8eJ5H4oQg0R0heaT0LUcx4,5,"Stayed for 5 nights, as a family of 4, in a quadruple room. Amazing location just of the Gran Via, good walking distance to all major city attractions. Service and cleaning levels really good. As other reviews have stated decor and maintenance in our room was a little tired and required some TLC, but this did not negatively impact the quality of our stay. Great Wifi for those that require it for work purposes. This hotel offers real value for money. It was our first time in Madrid, we loved the city and would definitely return to Petit Palace Chueca upon a future return."
ChIJZ8eJ5H4oQg0R0heaT0LUcx4,1,"Our experience of more than 1 week was chaotic! On the first night there was a huge leak in the room, we had to move to a much smaller one, whose bathroom door doesn't close and smells like sewage (because of the drain). It always takes a while to get into the hotel, because you have to wait for the attendant to open the door (horrible, improve that). On 12/31, when we returned from the street, we noticed that the card that opens the room, which we had left on the wall because of the heater, was missing. We were told that it must have been the cleaning team. And today, 01/01/2025, our room was not cleaned. In short, run away from this catastrophic experience."
ChIJkxrfv30oQg0R5S2slded3Dc,5,"We had dinner with 7 people (4 adults and 3 children) The food was great! Our waiter Adriano (I hope I'm not mistaken) was very kind, attentive and super smiling. I will order again, everything was very tasty + the children's menu and sangria ü§£üç∫üç∑üç∑üåÆüçóüçî"
ChIJkxrfv30oQg0R5S2slded3Dc,5,It was a great american restaurant that catches you the moment you step in. The atmosphere is great and very warm. Thanks Diana we have perfect time. I recommend ribeye but tell your preference beforehand.
ChIJkxrfv30oQg0R5S2slded3Dc,5,"All, it's amazing & unforgettable experience! Rate of 10!

Lovely hidden place in Madrid, expectacular , it's pretty amazing how's their services r given, hostess are so lovely, never treated same way before!

Beers, ribs, tasty and mouthwatering!

Definitely coming back for more!

Highly recommended to my friends as well!"
ChIJkxrfv30oQg0R5S2slded3Dc,4,Yummy ribs! Staff were friendly and cheerful. Our waitress Isamar was kind and patient while we thought of what to order. Food was American style as expected!
ChIJkxrfv30oQg0R5S2slded3Dc,5,"I ordered the tender ribs with Whiskey BBQ sauce, and they were excellent ‚Äî flavorful and perfectly tender. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the staff were very helpful, especially Adrian. Thanks again!"
ChIJqXASimIoQg0RhOtFDY1-fAA,4,"This is a cute place. The staff enjoy their work and it shows with their great service.
The food is OK, the coffee is good.  There‚Äôs a tendency to slightly undercook the eggs (which is fine and normal), and the brunch platters can be tricky to eat without taking some of the brown paper it‚Äôs served on.  It‚Äôs not really a problem and I‚Äôd be happy to come back.
We‚Äôve tried the brunch bar and the downstairs beach bar in the evening.  It‚Äôs a fun place."
ChIJqXASimIoQg0RhOtFDY1-fAA,5,"After 19 years, still one of my favourite restaurants. All day dining, great coffee, food and cava. Plus downstairs there's two beach sand themed dining areas, with the greatest album ever, the Beach Boys' ""Surf's Up"" on rotation."
ChIJqXASimIoQg0RhOtFDY1-fAA,5,"We stopped at Ojal√° for drinks in the afternoon, and it was a fantastic experience! Rosa was incredibly kind, and the entire staff was friendly and welcoming (Sorry I can't remember all the names!). While we sat at the bar, they chatted with us and gave us great recommendations for places to visit around the city.

The staff was fun, kind, and full of energy‚Äîwe had such a great time with them, sharing lots of laughter that truly lifted our spirits!

The atmosphere was fun and relaxed, and the drinks were perfectly crafted and absolutely delicious! The place itself is super cute and charming, with a unique touch‚Äî""La Playa"", a basement area with beach sand where you can sit and enjoy a more private and cozy setting.

We can‚Äôt wait to return to Ojal√° the next time we‚Äôre in Madrid! Highly recommend!"
ChIJqXASimIoQg0RhOtFDY1-fAA,5,"Such a cool spot! My friend and I decided to come to this place for brunch because we saw some ambiance-ful photos. The staff were incredibly sweet and the food was out of this world! Ordered the turkish eggs, the labneh hit the spot. Highly recommend if in the neighborhood and looking for an experience. Take a trip to the bathroom, you won't be disappointed."
ChIJqXASimIoQg0RhOtFDY1-fAA,5,"I had a fantastic dinner at Ojal√° last night. The atmosphere was warm and cozy. I ordered their famous food, which was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. The staff was attentive and friendly, constantly checking to make sure we had everything we needed. Prices were reasonable for the quality of food and service. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back‚Äîhighly recommend for a relaxed evening out!"
ChIJw2EHlYYoQg0RsGZYTq6Vc6Q,5,"Really delicious food! We stopped here for a few shares bites while walking Gran Via. The flavors did not disappoint and four shared plates was more than enough for three people. Every dish was great, but the artichoke and octopus were the best."
ChIJw2EHlYYoQg0RsGZYTq6Vc6Q,5,"Amazing place! Suggested by local colleague and it‚Äôs a gem! Incredible food, a huge variety of small tapas/dishes. Everything it‚Äôs tasty. The atmosphere is amazing, the drinks are great. Although it‚Äôs in gran via the place is only visited by locals. Went there twice and will definitely come back!"
ChIJw2EHlYYoQg0RsGZYTq6Vc6Q,5,"Our first day in the Madrid, we decided to stop here because it was next to our hotel.  Our first taste of Spain was a wonderful breakfast they served‚Äîeverything was fresh and delicious."
ChIJw2EHlYYoQg0RsGZYTq6Vc6Q,5,"Appreciation for Excellent Service at Mercado de la Reina

Dear Mercado de la Reina 12 Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the wonderful experience my family and I recently had at your establishment.

The brunch we enjoyed at the bar was truly delightful, thanks to the exceptional hands of the Jonays. We were thoroughly impressed with the skill and attention to detail they demonstrated in preparing and serving our food.

Moreover, the assistance provided by Barista Wendy added a special touch to our experience. Her expertise in crafting the finest beverages truly left us in awe. We are grateful for her warm and welcoming demeanor.

I'd also like to commend Eunice, the manager, for her exemplary leadership in ensuring everything ran smoothly. Her dedication to maintaining a high standard of service clearly reflects in her team's performance.

Thank you once again for providing us with such a premium service. We look forward to returning to Mercado de la Reina for another memorable experience.

Warm regards,

Jesus Navarrete"
ChIJw2EHlYYoQg0RsGZYTq6Vc6Q,1,"Everything was almost perfect for me at this restaurant except a piece of tissue found in the dish. It‚Äôs my fault to not check once we received the food. I found it when I was almost done

The staff asked if he would bring new plate but no it‚Äôs too late for that (too far to start eating and think about that piece of tissue in the dish). I paid the whole bill and left"
ChIJSc8uc30oQg0RKokKLx02MdY,2,"I ordered the Thai curry. It was so bland. I‚Äôm so disappointed. Thai dishes are supposed to be flavorful. It tasted almost like flavored water.

The portions are really nice though."
ChIJSc8uc30oQg0RKokKLx02MdY,5,"We are really impressed with the service and food quality in the Public Restaurant. One of the best restaurants we have visited in Barcelona, we highly recommend for having the delicious dinner. Special thanks for vendedor Michael V. for perfect service."
ChIJSc8uc30oQg0RKokKLx02MdY,5,"Amazing atmosphere, great meal and fabulous service, I would recommend this place eyes closed !"
ChIJSc8uc30oQg0RKokKLx02MdY,3,"Mediocre ingredients, you pay for the status. Food is made by a proper chef, low cost experience of a decent restaurant, although the manager was rude. A chubby guy with glasses and short gray hair"
ChIJSc8uc30oQg0RKokKLx02MdY,5,"This place was great. Good service, great cozy atmosphere as it describes.

Menu is Mediterranean with a flair of everything for anyone. My wife had the spinach cannolis that were rich in flavor but tasty.

The appetizers are actually the way to go here. Plentiful and you can share them with one another very easily. Portions are good.

Great value of a place. Ordered a Vodka very cold and straight up Martini. They nailed it.

This place is awesome."
ChIJD2f4AGUoQg0Reg9rkz7K_vQ,5,"Economic menu for 17,90 ‚Ç¨ including weekends. Well elaborated dish served nicely. Staff is very attentive. Drink not included. Large choices for desserts. Tiramisu and carrot cake were amazing."
ChIJD2f4AGUoQg0Reg9rkz7K_vQ,4,We dropped by for the menu of the day. Really nice place with good food and a cozy atmosphere. I had the salad and then the Argentinean steak. The steak was medium rare and really juicy. Very affordable prices and good service. A big High Five....
ChIJD2f4AGUoQg0Reg9rkz7K_vQ,5,"This spot is great for a casual night out. Really cute atmosphere. Great selection of food and drinks. Albara, our server, was fantastic and very patient as we were all English speakers."
ChIJD2f4AGUoQg0Reg9rkz7K_vQ,1,"Although the restaurant offers quick service, a variety of cuisines, and a pleasant ambiance, going here, is not a good decision.
Our group decided to try out a selection of dishes, including samosas, Vietnamese rolls, and both vegetarian and non-vegetarian pad Thai. The samosas were of 2.5/5, but unfortunately, the remaining dishes were quite disappointing and we struggled to finish them. Based on this experience, I would not recommend this restaurant. The overall food quality was below average, and we felt that it did not offer good value for the money spent"
ChIJD2f4AGUoQg0Reg9rkz7K_vQ,4,"The place has an indy vibe, colorful and relax. The music is trendy and good. The service is good. The food is modern, well presented and original. The menu portions are smaller. The lamb cutlets were very very small.
I like my meal there, I recommend it."
ChIJC1mMs2IoQg0RnEQPTyiBOUs,5,"Excellent service, amazing vibe, food is absolutely delicious. Alejandro and Enzo were really nice and went above and beyond with their service. We went there 2 nights in a row, and the food came out very fast. Totally recommend!"
ChIJC1mMs2IoQg0RnEQPTyiBOUs,5,Delicious! Recommend the veal cannoli ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è would skip the risotto (not pictured) as it‚Äôs nothing special. The dog fish was interesting.
ChIJC1mMs2IoQg0RnEQPTyiBOUs,5,"Waiter Luis was fabulous! So kind, attentive, and helpful with special requests (gluten free bread, dressing on side, fixing the table, and more). Truly wonderful service from him! And the salad was delicious - enjoy your meal here!"
ChIJC1mMs2IoQg0RnEQPTyiBOUs,1,"The waiter attacked me after I gave back a raw chicken hamburger,
My worst experience I have ever had  in a vacation.

Avoid this place for your own health"
ChIJC1mMs2IoQg0RnEQPTyiBOUs,5,The food was amazing!! And we had we best waitress! A big thank you to Dayris.
ChIJeZo1R4coQg0RomEiduJV2Ys,5,"After a very tiring day of work and exploring the city with friends, we randomly chose La Venganza de Malinche, a Mexican restaurant that turned out to be a memorable surprise. Our group shared the ""rueda de 12 tacos,"" nachos, two jars of margaritas, and two mojitos. Each dish was flavourful and true to the vibrant spirit of Mexican cuisine. The highlight, however, was the trio of mariachis, who transformed the evening into an unforgettable experience filled with music and joy.

A special mention goes to Danny, whose recommendations enhanced our evening. His friendly and attentive service, coupled with his expertise in guiding us through the menu, added a personal touch that made all the difference.

While the food, vibe, and music were fantastic, the experience could be elevated even further with some minor tweaks.

I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to visit, savour the incredible food, immerse yourself in the lively vibe, and appreciate the wonderful service. Don‚Äôt forget to share your thoughts‚Äîit‚Äôs clear that this restaurant is passionate about delivering a stellar experience and continuously improving!"
ChIJeZo1R4coQg0RomEiduJV2Ys,3,"Super friendly staff, nice decor, reasonable prices. I didn‚Äôt enjoy the food to be honest, it wasn‚Äôt to my taste that‚Äôs all. It was presented lovely and made with good ingredients. Location is very central and easy to reach. Good selection of meals and drinks"
ChIJeZo1R4coQg0RomEiduJV2Ys,5,"Made a group of Singaporeans felt right at home in Mexico despite the language barrier. Staff was friendly and welcoming, patient with our order. Food was excellent, we had the quesas and nachos along with sangria. The live band was amazing and engaging, like a little fiesta in the middle of Madrid! Love it!"
ChIJeZo1R4coQg0RomEiduJV2Ys,2,"Firstly I would like to say that the staff were very nice and the restaurant was one of the most eye-catching places I've, however, it's my passion for Mexican food in which I must give such a low rating. Although this was the coolest looking Mexican restaurant I've been in the food was the worst, not to say it was bad just not good. Ordered Taco but I got something of a cross between Enchiladas and Fajita, was also very expensive. Would like to give five stars for the staff and the decorations of the place."
ChIJeZo1R4coQg0RomEiduJV2Ys,5,"The service with Danny was spetacular, I really loved it and the food is soooo good with a great price. I'm very happy I founded this place to eat in Madrid!"
ChIJyyYDC3woQg0RZ8cee-5110o,5,"Employees were super nice and food was delicious. It was very fresh and authentic. We had the edamame, gyoza, California roll, and sushi salmon."
ChIJyyYDC3woQg0RZ8cee-5110o,2,"The only thing worth trying is the miso soup and the fried rice, small, old and they can hardly speak Spanish, the fried sushi tastes like old oil."
ChIJyyYDC3woQg0RZ8cee-5110o,4,"Decent sushi, quickly made. The sushi portions were a bit small, though, with a small-ish amount of fish. I paid 20 eur and came out still hungry. I'll consider it a sort of diet."
ChIJyyYDC3woQg0RZ8cee-5110o,5,"I love this place for their simplicity and good quality sushi. You can tell from the freshness on a week day of their tuna. Their service is ok, could be friendlier and more professional (the guy seemed very junior and a bit unhappy), but otherwise, it‚Äôs worth eating there. I‚Äôve been going for years"
ChIJyyYDC3woQg0RZ8cee-5110o,5,The most incredible Japanese restaurant I have found in Madrid! The plates look humble but the taste is AMAZING! Service is always perfect and also the other dishes are great. But the Kimuchi Salmon is by far my favourite. I enjoy every meal there.
ChIJU3p1EnwoQg0RKifh5RVchNo,5,Food was delicious. Antonio was just amazing! He makes all the experience way better. Can‚Äôt wait to come back to casa Parrondo
ChIJU3p1EnwoQg0RKifh5RVchNo,5,"Very Spanish vibe activity, two huge plates of food + bottle of traditional cider - 11 euro. Muy bien."
ChIJU3p1EnwoQg0RKifh5RVchNo,5,"I have been coming here for ages while living in Madrid and am still coming living abroad!

And that‚Äôs why they get my 5 stars. This is a legend in Madrid with authentic people and food. Delivering a good quality Cantabria cuisine in the heart of Madrid. Don‚Äôt be a fool, you are visiting Madrid and want to have a great meal in a cool relaxed informal atmosphere? This is the right spot. Don‚Äôt you think this is a touristy trap, it‚Äôs as authentic as you can get. Fair prices, good quality food and a caring cool typical madrilean style service. I love this place and I will keep coming back."
ChIJU3p1EnwoQg0RKifh5RVchNo,4,"We took a chance on this restaurant and were delighted with the food and service.  The waiter, Alberto, was hilarious and kept us entertained. We would thoroughly recommend coming here."
ChIJU3p1EnwoQg0RKifh5RVchNo,5,Wonderful old world atmosphere and delicious food. Always well taken care of with many special touches
ChIJq47m1ocoQg0RwcMwepzYLFM,5,"When we came around 21:45, they told us that the terrace closed at 22:30, but we were still able to sit outside which was super nice. The food came really fast, and tasted amazing. When they forgot to bring our tortilla they were so friendly and took it off our bill immediately. Great service!"
ChIJq47m1ocoQg0RwcMwepzYLFM,5,"Luna y Jose are the best we love you
Food is really good
Nice cozy place"
ChIJq47m1ocoQg0RwcMwepzYLFM,5,"This was one of the best food experiences in Madrid and the sangria is amazing as well, would definitely recommend. The service was amazing as well (the girl who was working outside on the 23rd of October :)"
ChIJq47m1ocoQg0RwcMwepzYLFM,5,I found this place before start my job. Lovely place and great breakfast. The staff is so nice ! Estefi.thank you.
ChIJq47m1ocoQg0RwcMwepzYLFM,5,"The food, drinks and atmosphere whether dining inside or on the teraza, are wonderful. The employees are very friendly. This is my 3rd visit and won't be my last."
ChIJnRgCC3woQg0R5YjWCZyAsK8,5,I came with my family and the service and food were great! The server recommended some dishes and everything was delicious. If your close by you should definitely try it out!
ChIJnRgCC3woQg0R5YjWCZyAsK8,1,Food was bad and overpriced. No understanding of allergies despite having markings on the menu so one of our party could not eat. Waiter was friendly and service was quick but do not recommend.
ChIJnRgCC3woQg0R5YjWCZyAsK8,5,"Went twice to this place and got great, friendly service on both times. Beer came with tapas, food was tasting great! The business has a family atmosphere that I really appreciated"
ChIJnRgCC3woQg0R5YjWCZyAsK8,4,Nice food and service
ChIJnRgCC3woQg0R5YjWCZyAsK8,3,"We went to Los Amigos for a quick dinner.  We ordered a Papas Brava, 2 small bottle water since they did not have the large bottle.  Also ordered the revuelto mushroom with shrimp and the beef steak combo, flan, and a pudding.  The food was ok.  The beef steak combo was undercooked on the edges.  The papas bravas could have been better.  Tasted like a Denny‚Äôs restaurant.  The best was their cream pudding and flan.  Dishes were mediocre.  Price for almost 50 Euro for two people. More like tourist food on my opinion."
ChIJ31S8C4AoQg0RS_4zoU214W8,5,"I was staying in this Hotel with my family for over 10 days and we had an amazing experience. We can‚Äôt be more thankful with all the staff, starting in the from desk, Anthony and Ursula helped us a lot, as well as the rest of the receptionist. In the bar and restaurant the service was incredible, if you have the opportunity to take the breakfast buffet in the hotel, is one of the best decision. And finally the ladies who cleaned the rooms were extremely kind and always up to help you out. The service here is above incredible, thanks again!"
ChIJ31S8C4AoQg0RS_4zoU214W8,5,Super hotel with super staff ..both the Azaharas at reception were so helpful and professional throughout our recent stay late April / early May 2024.  Thank you to all ..you really made our stay special. The room was lovely as was decor and traditional features and despite being so central was so so quiet with extremely comfortable beds. Breakfast service was very good and again lovely staff. Bar staff also fab. David was our hero on the 1 st May locating a taxi for us during a protest march day which was making travelling difficult. Can't thank him enough for going above and beyond for us.  A very special stay and cannot recommend enough. Hope to be back!
ChIJ31S8C4AoQg0RS_4zoU214W8,5,"We stayed in March 2024. We got an excellent room. The rooms are sound proof and the beds are extremely comfortable. You cannot beat the location. It is central to everything and walking distance to all major spots in Madrid. The staff was excellent and helped us in everything. Ana, Alba, Azahara, and Freddy were so professional and attentive to all our needs. They were super helpful in everything. They even sent a bottle of champagne to our room for our anniversary. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone."
ChIJ31S8C4AoQg0RS_4zoU214W8,5,We stayed for four nights and the hotel was very good and in a great location. Rooms were quite big and comfortable. Breakfast staff were excellent. Small issue that the hotel provided rooms with a kettle but no cups. Took a few times to get the cups. Nice views and small pool was very peaceful to relax in the late afternoon and get some sun. All the staff were good and will come back. Also had an accessible room which was very good. Water machine near the lift which was good. Recommended
ChIJ31S8C4AoQg0RS_4zoU214W8,4,"Location is amazing, on the Main Street and a 5-10 minute walk to most areas and attractions. Staff are very friendly and pleasant, our room was large and the balcony my was very nice! Would recommend staying here!"
ChIJ8xKGEogoQg0REcIj5XURiIU,5,"Highly recommend! Great atmosphere, drinks and food. We tried the vermouth, Gilda, calamari and some anchovy toast. Everything was delicious and well priced."
ChIJ8xKGEogoQg0REcIj5XURiIU,5,"Nice tapas bar with a great decoration of nostalgia! The only problem was we went after 17:00 and all the tapas were almost finished so we had limited place options, just that you are aware."
ChIJ8xKGEogoQg0REcIj5XURiIU,5,"I visited first time about 10 years ago, haven‚Äôt had the chance to comeback since. But today it finally happened. Still great tapas, the ambiance is beautifully madridian and the service is friendly and warm. 10/10 will not wait a decade to rerun this time‚Ä¶"
ChIJ8xKGEogoQg0REcIj5XURiIU,5,Authentic tapas restaurant with excellent service from Alfredo. Simply top notch! We have been there several times and have never been disappointed. No visit to Madrid without stopping by here..
ChIJ8xKGEogoQg0REcIj5XURiIU,5,"One of my favorite places in Madrid for tapas and vermouth. Best tortilla ever. I was in Madrid for 4 days and came by twice. I'd probably have went more if it wasn't so busy. And yes, it is constantly busy."
ChIJ7a2LTWMoQg0RtbK5qBIxqVI,5,"Tasty pizza and pasta!

I found this place accidentally, but I can say that they have the best pizza from Madrid. I took salami picante and was just like in Italy.

So if you want to find an authentic italian pizza in Madrid, here is the place!"
ChIJ7a2LTWMoQg0RtbK5qBIxqVI,4,"Pizza was super good tasting and was cooked great. It has the potential to really be top notch, but what stood out to me that prevented it from doing so, was the burnt crumbs from other pizzas that was stuck to the bottom of my pizza. Every other bite you would really notice the flavour of not just burnt crust, but a burnt powder that would throw off the flavour of the pizza. Honestly besides that it was great. Maybe something to look into for the chefs."
ChIJ7a2LTWMoQg0RtbK5qBIxqVI,5,Very nice neighborhood place. SO GLAD WE FOUND IT Neopalitan pizza is great. We also had main courses pasta was fresh and delicious. Service is excellent and the wine was great and very reasonable. Its a real find in Madrid a taste of real Italian food
ChIJ7a2LTWMoQg0RtbK5qBIxqVI,5,"Spent my Valentine‚Äôs Day there, and it was amazing! The food was fabulous and it‚Äôs the best Italian in Madrid. Highly recommended"
ChIJ7a2LTWMoQg0RtbK5qBIxqVI,5,"Best pizza we've ever had! My husband ordered 2 and finished both. I ordered the pasta d'mare and the sauce was soooo good. The portion was tiny though, so it was not enough to share with anyone. We also ordered the pizza dough stuffed with Nutella and that was amazing. It was large so we had some left for takeaway. The place is small so make reservations as it fills up fast. We arrived when it opened at 8:30pm and it was full by 9:30pm."
ChIJdxPahH4oQg0RGMIUW6VRVlQ,4,"Two days ago, I visited a restaurant with a friend and ordered fritura de pescado (fried seafood platter) and bocadillo de calamares con ali oli (calamari sandwich with aioli). The fried shrimp were tasty, but there was more clumped batter than shrimp. When you squeeze lemon over the calamari and fish, combined with the delicious sauce, the flavors come together nicely. The bocadillo de calamares con ali oli (calamari sandwich with aioli) was slightly above average, and if you‚Äôre really hungry, two sandwiches would be a better choice. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place for seafood lovers!"
ChIJdxPahH4oQg0RGMIUW6VRVlQ,5,"Given the location, this place is a fantastic find! Maybe a little understaffed, but nonetheless very friendly and fast service! And the food is great and reasonably priced too üòä Would highly recommend the pan con tumaca ‚Äì was my favourite out of the things we ordered!"
ChIJdxPahH4oQg0RGMIUW6VRVlQ,5,We ate here last night and our server is the only one who spoke English. He was amazing. The food was freshly cooked and was really good! We would come back again.
ChIJdxPahH4oQg0RGMIUW6VRVlQ,4,"Let me be clear and honest . From all the bars I went this one has the best deal of beer . 3 beers for $6,75. I had that deal and ate a mix of delicious croquetas. The service was really good as well
A must go in Madrid."
ChIJdxPahH4oQg0RGMIUW6VRVlQ,4,"Stopped in last nice as it was close to our hotel. Quaint little spot with a cool vibe. Cold Estrella on tap and we had the tosta de jamon and the seafood platter. The squid was done perfectly, the calamari was tender and the anchovies were delicious. The meal was very affordable for the area."
ChIJoT1qvWIoQg0Rx4BO0gNnq-A,5,Small but full of charm. Best jamon croquetas Ive had in all madrid. Unbeatable prices for the quantity and quality of the food. Delish albondigas! Zarro vermut is a must try.
ChIJoT1qvWIoQg0Rx4BO0gNnq-A,4,"I liked it. They specialise in croquettes so I had to try them. I took the black pudding and quince one as well as the blue cheese.

They were tasty and the coating on the outside was nice and thin. I could have had more black pudding and blue cheese flavour, respectively, but all in all good croquettes.

I think it would be a nice place to come with some friends so you can try a large variety of croquettes and other tapas dishes.

I came at 18:30 and knew it would be quiet but it just happened to work with my schedule. I'd say come after 8 to get more of a buzz.

By the way, the vermouth (which came with some olives, which is always a pleasure) is a new one for me and was ridiculously good!"
ChIJoT1qvWIoQg0Rx4BO0gNnq-A,4,"We are visiting from Canada and had this restaurant in our list for must eat places. The service was great and the food was quick. The QR code menu has photos and English available to make ordering easier as well.

Food was a tad bit salty but for the price, it is definitely great value. We got the half portions as well so we can try more items which worked out great since it was a great portion to share 3-4 items for two people."
ChIJoT1qvWIoQg0Rx4BO0gNnq-A,5,"It was the best place where we ate in Madrid. Tinto verano was delicious and the dishes, which were just some tapas, were a delight. We had the croquetes, some fried sausage and patatas bravas. Everything nice and hot and completely savoury. The place is not that big, but hat makes it friendly and cosy."
ChIJoT1qvWIoQg0Rx4BO0gNnq-A,5,"Our family of 5 went to Casa Julio during our stay in Madrid. What an amazing service we had. The pisto was top notch, the ensalada de pimentos e the carne herre√±a also! Buenas ca√±as! We even got to try a bit of vermut! We will definitely come back when in Madrid."
ChIJIUwEzYcoQg0RET6itjYMRGk,5,"In the terrace you won‚Äôt think you are in the center of Madrid! Perfect for a drink and dinner with colleagues.
I definitely recommend their homemade cider, the pineapple and pear one it‚Äôs worth trying.
For eating we tried the homemade hummus with dried tomatoes and the empanada with tuna and peppers, so tasty!
I would come back with no doubt üòá"
ChIJIUwEzYcoQg0RET6itjYMRGk,5,"Great place, super nice staff. Very reasonable prices. Server was super kind and dealt with my poor Spanish. Would recommend to anyone great place for a bite and drink."
ChIJIUwEzYcoQg0RET6itjYMRGk,5,The backyard space was so nice. Apparently going on a Sunday meant they were out of a lot of menu items. Still the food was pretty good and the service was great.
ChIJIUwEzYcoQg0RET6itjYMRGk,5,"Super cozy place with a great atmosphere, lovely terrace in the garden where you can escape from the heat‚ù§Ô∏è The food was great and the staff is very lovely and friendly. The Patatas Bravas much recommended!"
ChIJIUwEzYcoQg0RET6itjYMRGk,5,"I had a quick coffee with a friend there. Lovely cafe. It's very chilled especially the outdoor area. The location is very central, at the chueca area side of Madrid."
ChIJoQ2oZX0oQg0R6nFdo0cK4vs,5,Excellent food and service. I would definitely do the tasting menu. You get to try their best dishes and they do small portions so you don‚Äôt feel like you over ate by the end. Great place for a business lunch or special occasions.
ChIJoQ2oZX0oQg0R6nFdo0cK4vs,5,"One of the few Michelin star restaurants where we had a spectacular meal and didn‚Äôt feel full / bloated once we were done.
We trusted the chef with all the dishes and we couldn‚Äôt have made a better choice.
Incredible raw materials, perfectly cooked and paired with the right sauces (see the pics). Represents perfectly the Spanish traditional dishes with the best possible techniques developed over years of high end cuisine.
Very well deserved Michelin star!"
ChIJoQ2oZX0oQg0R6nFdo0cK4vs,4,"You wouldn't expect this quality and type of restaurant in this place, but it's been here for years! The food is amazing, very seasonal and fresh. It's fine dining, but without the molecular or fancy things, just great ingredients prepared with love. The wines are amazing too! It's on the pricey side if you expect to be pampered like a Michelin star restaurant or comparable price, but the local atmosphere and friendly people make up for it. The shrimps and the salpicon are so good and if you're lucky enough to get the teardrop peas, you're going to have one of the best meals"
ChIJoQ2oZX0oQg0R6nFdo0cK4vs,5,"We have loved the experience! The restaurant is very cozy with about 7 tables. The chef and his team are extremely professional and made us really enjoy the evening.

In this restaurant we do recommend ordering the tasting menu (88‚Ç¨): a trip through Spain with 9 dishes of excellent traditional cuisine. They prepared a personalized tasting menu by deciding together with the Chef the dishes that we liked the most and least on the menu."
ChIJoQ2oZX0oQg0R6nFdo0cK4vs,4,"A cosy and small family restaurant  with a 50-year history, La Tasquita de Enfrente serves seasonal market produce. The food is a modern take on French-inspired cuisine that can be savoured on a tasting menu that changes daily.
Friendly service"
ChIJMTG_iGIoQg0Ranz0nVfiUMk,4,"I first came here with a friend and we shared a couple of starters that were all very tasty. Especially their amazing hummus! But when I came back with my husband and ordered some mains, we were quite disappointed with the bland flavours. But since I am gluten intolerant, I love that this place uses absolutely no gluten in any of its dishes! So will return for the starters.

Below what we ordered + my personal rating:

1. Guacamole 4*
2. Hummus 5* (absolutely recommend)
3. Artichoke 4*
4. Gnocchi 2-3*
5. Hamburger 2*"
ChIJMTG_iGIoQg0Ranz0nVfiUMk,5,"The vibe here is bright and friendly and the food was impressively good at an outstanding price! Enjoy the creative and thoughtful appetizers and definitely go with the prix fixe menu. I had an excellent soup, tacos, and the best dessert ever! Homemade lemonade is a must. Recommend everything."
ChIJMTG_iGIoQg0Ranz0nVfiUMk,5,"Every dish is an amazing discovery of new and surprising flavors. You can tell that the cooks create and prepare everything with great care. The Thai salad is a must, just like the chocolate brownie with avocado ice cream. And the hummus!
Reserve in advance, as this restaurant can be very crowded!"
ChIJMTG_iGIoQg0Ranz0nVfiUMk,5,"Avocado Love is a very special restaurant. It's a small space and beautifully decorated. Because it is small, they only allow 1.5 hours to eat. There were five of us and we all decided to share a bunch of things. I highly recommend doing this! However, one complaint we had was they didn't bring dishes fast enough, so we were asked to give up our table for the next reservation before we were finished eating. That was a bit of a bummer. They were, however, very kind and allowed us to sip our wine at a little standing bar that they had. They also offered us a free dessert. :)

We tried 6 very delicious dishes. We would have also liked to try the Jack-Daniels grilled avocado, but that can be for next time. ;)

HUMMUS DE AGUACATE Y BERENJENA EN TEMPURA AL AGAVE (avocado hummus with aubergine in agave tempura) - This was completely delicious. The combo of creamy hummus, crunchy aubergine and sweet agave made my mouth go wooooooooow.

ENSALADA DE QUINOA Y AGUACATE (quinoa salad and avocado) - idk what they did to this but the sauce they used for the avocado salad was so flavourful and delicious. They also had some crispy sweet potato things on the top that added a bomb texture.

BOCADOS DECAUSA LIME√ëA CON AGUACATE (casa Lime√±a bites with avocado) - These were also so good!! So many flavours and textures in one bite! yes yes yes! The dish came with drops of something purple which turned out to be pureed olives - delicious!

FIDEOS THAI EN DOS TEXTURAS (thai noodles of two textures) - omg this one was so much fun. You're supposed to mix everything up and in doing so, the sauce changes the texture of the noodles. This dish was full of interesting tastes and textures as well. It had some unique thai flavours too.

CEVICHE DE SETAS Y AGUACATE (ceviche mushroom and avocado mix) - I was really curious how this would be. Like ceviche, you mix the ingredients up so the lime can ""cook"" the fish (or in this case mushrooms). It sort of worked actually. I can't say that it's the same as ceviche and I don't think you should expect that, but the flavours went very nicely together and it was a good meal. Our friend who hates mushrooms enjoyed this one.

PIMIENTOS DE PIQUILLO RELLENOS DE UCHUCUCHA DE AGUACATE (piquillo peppers stuffed with avocado) - Our last dish of the night. The pepper taste really came through and was strong and delicious. It was warm and yummy.

The dessert they gave us was also very nice and light. And the wine that we ordered was delicious.

We would definitely come back to enjoy several dishes and try new ones too! Make sure to make a reservation!"
ChIJMTG_iGIoQg0Ranz0nVfiUMk,5,"Tumble into this little vegan place, so we decided to give it try since we loves vegan plates. Beautifully decorated. We ordered 4 different plates, all are delicious. Maybe the ceviche can be less vinegar.  Besides that everything is outstanding. Our server is lovely and attentive. Highly recommend if you are into vegan."
ChIJY4KPo2UoQg0RJHVUMCkDw9M,5,"Very cute place; decoration is everywhere, so over the top that it somehow works and creates a great ambiance, cozy and dreamlike. The cocktails were very nice if you like them sweet, interesting and at a good price. Large choice of coffees and hot chocolate!"
ChIJY4KPo2UoQg0RJHVUMCkDw9M,5,"We got the artichokes and the burrata, as well as a cosmo and a hot chocolate. The food was good, although a bit pricy. It‚Äôs nice to just grab a drink and a plate or two to share. The decor is so cute, I loved it. The hot chocolate isn‚Äôt anything to write home about."
ChIJY4KPo2UoQg0RJHVUMCkDw9M,5,"El Jardine is a magical place to visit. The outside of the restaurant is lovely, however when we walked in, we were overwhelmed with the amazing atmosphere. The decor is truly outstanding.  The attached pictures attest to that. We were warmly greeted and escorted to a lovely table.  All the tables are lovely. We experienced the full bodied red wine.  We had the artichoke dish. It was beautiful as you will see.  It was delicious. The side accompaniment was so flavourful.

The voices of the diners was so happy.

We will return for our last night, we have been in Madrid for 2 months.

Do miss visiting here."
ChIJY4KPo2UoQg0RJHVUMCkDw9M,3,"Overrated venue, personally, It's feel like decorations have been thrown at walls, got no sequence, no connection. I have to go for a third choice, consider 1st and 2nd plates were out of the menu at 9pm. No memories taken from this place whatsoever, perhaps an afternoon drink, not my favourite dinner location."
ChIJY4KPo2UoQg0RJHVUMCkDw9M,5,"The decor is stunning, the menu extensive. We went for dessert and a drink. The ‚Äòmuerte por chocolate‚Äô is big, 2 pieces of cake, moist and not too sweet. I had chocolate coulant and I liked mine better. Great atmosphere, super fun decor and good service."
ChIJOUtt6I4oQg0RVU72AxOfphY,1,"I was initially considering booking this hotel for my upcoming trip to Madrid. However, after hearing a firsthand account from a trusted friend, I decided to reconsider. She had to cancel her reservation well in advance (over a month before the stay) due to unforeseen travel disruptions, but unfortunately, the hotel was unwilling to offer a refund or flexible solution. Reliable and fair customer service is very important to me when choosing where to stay, so I have decided to explore other options."
ChIJOUtt6I4oQg0RVU72AxOfphY,5,"I can't fault the Petit Palace Santa Barbara in any way. The room was well appointed with a large bathroom and a huge walk-in shower. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were excellent. The hotel is housed in an attractive old building that retains character and charm. I was lucky enough to have a plaza facing room with a Juliette balcony.
The breakfast choice was typical Spanish and very enjoyable. All the staff that I encountered were very professional. They even label the towels ""towel"" just in case you may have had a couple...
All in all, it is a wonderful hotel in a fabulous city."
ChIJOUtt6I4oQg0RVU72AxOfphY,3,"Mostly ok, friendly staff and location is excellent, but I cannot recommend staying here with small kids as the loud noice from the lobby bar most nights makes it very hard for anyone to fall asleep sleep before midnight."
ChIJOUtt6I4oQg0RVU72AxOfphY,1,"The room smells pretty bad because, the plumbing, smells like sewer water.
Is not update on entertainment, the tv only has free channels and not posibilites to connect your own account to Netflix or anything.
Room service never answered and later they said that you have to go to the lobby to order."
ChIJOUtt6I4oQg0RVU72AxOfphY,5,"Petit but great !
Definitely my hotel in Madrid. Revisiting here whenever  arriving at the city... Always friendly, service oriented, clean, fresh &tasty breakfast and great location"
ChIJ6ZjCSpooQg0RkGtrp-n0exY,5,"Manuel, Nelson, and the rest of the team took exceptional care of us during our stay - the room was lovely, clean, and comfortable. The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly, and they made our honeymoon special. The complimentary breakfast was delicious and high quality. The hotel is a perfect location, and easy find after a day of walking around Madrid thanks to its proximity to the arches and the park."
ChIJ6ZjCSpooQg0RkGtrp-n0exY,5,"We do love the Hospes chain of hotels so this was the natural choice for our visit to Madrid.  We had no idea just how well it was positioned directly opposite La Puerta de Alcal√° and a stones through from all the best sites of Madrid.  We had a 4th floor suite that was perfect for us as a couple and a child, spacious, cool and with an amazing view.  Breakfast is excellent and the terrace restaurant serves great food with amazing service (we would stay away from Ramses terrace next door unless you enjoy poor service).  Overall, we would not stay anywhere else in Madrid now!"
ChIJ6ZjCSpooQg0RkGtrp-n0exY,5,"I finally have time to write a review for my stay in early November. During our stay, we really love everything the hotel offered. The service is impeccable! The people that work there are so nice and helpful. There are so many things to do around the hotel which is nice. We will be back in a couple weeks! Thanks so much!"
ChIJ6ZjCSpooQg0RkGtrp-n0exY,5,"Six years ago, my family and I decided to stay in Hospes Puerta de Alcal√°, never knowing that this would become such a special part of our lives. Since that first visit, no other hotel has ever been an option for us. This is so much more than a place to lay your head; it's a home, truly made by the exceptional care and professionalism of Ilia and Fernando.

Ilia and Fernando manage to make each guest feel really special; their warmth and attention to details, along with their passion for hospitality, can turn a beautiful hotel into a memorable one. From the most genuine welcome to thoughtful recommendations of their constant acts of kindness, they manage to make any stay special.

Since then, we have returned so many times because of Ilia and Fernando. Their hospitality built a relation that seemed more like family than staff and guest.

If you‚Äôre searching for a hotel that feels like home, Hospes Puerta de Alcal√° is the one. Thank you, Ilia and Fernando, for always making our stays so memorable we‚Äôre already looking forward to next year!"
ChIJ6ZjCSpooQg0RkGtrp-n0exY,5,"Walked past the entrance and - obviously tourists - was approached by a man walking past us. Turned out to be Daniel, the Bell Boy, who was off somewhere else but recognised our minor confusion about where the hotel was. Went out of his way to take us to the lobby, sorted out a welcome drink as we checked in, then took us to our room and explained EVERYTHING.
As we went out for the evening, he was there with a complimentary umbrella to shelter us from the evening drizzle.
Never saw him again to offer our sincere gratitude and a tip, sadly.
Also given a welcome bottle of wine in our room.
Hotel itself was delightful - bit disappointed to only be spending a single night here."
ChIJ0U9LFZooQg0RgdlcHxZdkek,5,"Our first time in Madrid, this hotel exceeded our expectations. The staff graciously welcomed us. Our suite was immaculate and well-appointed. The housekeeping day and evening staff were professional. The hotel is situated in a lovely, safe, non-touristic area with easy access to the park and dozens of museums and shops. We will return!"
ChIJ0U9LFZooQg0RgdlcHxZdkek,4,"Location, Location, Location.. This hotel has it all.. walking distance to most of Madrid attractions and many great restaurants.. Upscale , Safe and quiet neighbourhood.
The rooms are great size with a little kitchenette and the staff are super helpful..
The only caveat  is that they are doing construction on the hotel restaurant and starting around 7:30 am u can clearly gear that in ur room  which is makes it impossible to sleep"
ChIJ0U9LFZooQg0RgdlcHxZdkek,5,"Me, my wife and daughter had a lovely short stay here. Our room was great...very comfy and spacious (and even with a kitchenette). The staff were brilliant and very helpful and the location is great for access to local attractions, shopping, bars & restaurants... Plus only a 15-20 min taxi ride from the airport. Would definitely recommend it to anyone."
ChIJ0U9LFZooQg0RgdlcHxZdkek,3,"While the location is very good, the rate for this hotel is way off! If they charged 50% of what they're charging would be about right. This hotel is dark, old and gloomy. Their lighting is horrible, ultra bright white lights in the rooms, makes you feel you're in a laboratory or something like that. Beds are decent!"
ChIJ0U9LFZooQg0RgdlcHxZdkek,5,So happy we found this hotel ! Everything was great ! We shall return every time we come to Madrid
ChIJ6bFN0IUoQg0R1XooZXPpSgg,4,"This is a very pleasant, cosy, historic restaurant, apparently the second oldest in Madrid, with beautiful tiled walls. The service was friendly and helpful. The menu was has a good variety of dishes. I started with the largest slice of tomato I‚Äôve ever seen - it was delicious. My main course was Iberian ham and eggs, also excellent. I finished by indulging in a very good hazelnut ice cream. I recommend all of these dishes, and the rest of the menu also looked great."
ChIJ6bFN0IUoQg0R1XooZXPpSgg,5,"We visited as a family on April 9th. These were the best meals we've ever had. Anna was very sweet and helped us a lot with the service, choices, and the history of the tavern. The other waiters were also equally friendly and helpful. If you happen to be around in Madrid, be sure to come and try their food and wines."
ChIJ6bFN0IUoQg0R1XooZXPpSgg,4,"My boyfriend still reminisces about these tomatoes even 7 months later. He describes them as ‚Äòthe kind that encapsulate the world within.‚Äô Paired with a glass of vermut, this place offers a nice lunch break. The vibrant, tasteful tiles add an extra layer of charm to the experience. I‚Äôm not entirely convinced about the price-performance ratio; it feels a bit overpriced. Additionally, there‚Äôs a noticeable language barrier and a hint of an eye-roll attitude toward tourists."
ChIJ6bFN0IUoQg0R1XooZXPpSgg,3,"Had dinner with my family in this charming place. One of the oldest restaurants in Madrid which still has some of the 19th century charm. We had several of their traditional dishes including the ensaladilla, meatballs and lentil stew. All were ok but not good enough to justify the prices they charge (portions on the smaller side) despite using locally sourced ingredients. What I felt abusive was the price they charged for the bread. We were four so they charged 2.55 each despite getting one basket of bread. So more than 10 euros for one basket of bread is a robbery (see the picture to see it). The staff were very attentive."
ChIJ6bFN0IUoQg0R1XooZXPpSgg,2,"We visited the restaurant as it was recommended from a friend as ""the best place to eat paella"". The food was mediocre to absolutely horrendous. Pricey and flavourless. The worst paella we've eaten. Runny, mushy, flavourless. A huge tomato for 18 euros. The only flavorful item on the menu was the cheese balls. The veal overly salty. The service at least was good and the decor was very authentic. But overall, food wise it was really bad."
ChIJ7z95co8oQg0Rmv1oLVb6cHw,5,"Decided to celebrate my 50th birthday here because of all the memories of when I first lived in the neighbourhood, because it was easy to have a gluten and lactose free menu AND it was close to the office. Always liked the place but the staff really went out of their way to make it a great party! (Including adding a last minute vegeteraian dish for my niece üòç) Highly recommend it if you are looking for authentic Mexican taste, good margaritas, and a jovial atmosphere. Everyone enjoyed themselves! Thank you üòäü•≥"
ChIJ7z95co8oQg0Rmv1oLVb6cHw,5,"Apart from the food , the flavors and the hospitality with a real Mexican touch , our host dylan was a force to be reckoned with. He suggested us the best dishes , beverages and pairings. Do ask for him when your there !"
ChIJ7z95co8oQg0Rmv1oLVb6cHw,3,"Summary: Meh. I‚Äôve been to this place before and remember it was so much better. Last time I went there the quality of the food was not so great, in the sense that none of the dishes had any distinct flavor. Also, in our case the dishes came a little cold(ish), so it wasn‚Äôt pleasant. The strawberry margarita I ordered tasted more like ice than anything. It was ok to have lunch there during the week but I wouldn‚Äôt go back purposefully."
ChIJ7z95co8oQg0Rmv1oLVb6cHw,5,"Truly an amazing experience! The restaurant has such cool vibes in the inside, the menu design is very beautiful and fun. They offer a big number amount of selection, from food to drinks. The food is absolutely delicious!"
ChIJ7z95co8oQg0Rmv1oLVb6cHw,4,"The food it's really good and the ambiance it's very laid back and cheerful, just like in Mexico. The service was a bit slow and they did forget to bring my sister her drink. The portions could be shared, but only if you have an entree and a dessert."
ChIJ6zDwtYgoQg0RfyrlCcpNMMo,5,"Amazing customer service. Cocktails and food were really nice also. To chill and relax, it's a nice place. You can sit on sand area or even laying down on a bed. Definitely we will be coming back ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJ6zDwtYgoQg0RfyrlCcpNMMo,2,"The place is not in a bad location.  The menu is somewhat complicated.  There are many interesting cocktails.  The waiters are friendly and very helpful.  They explained the complicated cocktails to us one by one.  However, I think the prices are quite high for such a place.  I shared the QR code of the menu in the images so that you can see the prices.  Although it is a place that specializes in cocktails, I think the cocktail taste was not that good.  I think the place should set a few signature cocktails and not sell anything else.  They also failed in music."
ChIJ6zDwtYgoQg0RfyrlCcpNMMo,5,"Amazing place. Beautiful and special decoration, friendly stuff !! We had a drink and some quesadillas. Everything was perfect in normal prices.
Don't miss it !!"
ChIJ6zDwtYgoQg0RfyrlCcpNMMo,5,"Great bar with all the known drinks and some special house drinks. A great environment to get some drinks with your friends, have some appetizers or celebrate a special moment. Servers are very animated!

Prices are in the lower range for Madrid and the decoration makes the night more special."
ChIJ6zDwtYgoQg0RfyrlCcpNMMo,4,We stopped only for drinks and the Dj was playing some really good music. Nice spot and people. The decoration of this place is amazing. Drinks were strong but they have an amazing variety of options.
ChIJ5bJ2s4QoQg0RXpYtjKH6Rj8,4,Had a great DJ but you have to pay $10 euro just to get in and then receive a $5 euro drink ticket. Not worth it for the minimal views. It‚Äôs a corner spot so not a full vantage point. I bought and espresso martini which was delicious.
ChIJ5bJ2s4QoQg0RXpYtjKH6Rj8,5,Beautiful views in a very accessible location. Great place to have a relaxing cocktail (or mock tail) and some delicious bites. Waitstaff was very friendly and attentive
ChIJ5bJ2s4QoQg0RXpYtjKH6Rj8,5,Very nice place with a great view especially for watching the sunset! Very kind stuff particularly the lady from Bulgaria :)
ChIJ5bJ2s4QoQg0RXpYtjKH6Rj8,4,Great place for amazing views! You should go by noon ( when they open) so you can get a table with the view. You can choose some tapas and cheese with a rose and you are done!!! Tje only thing they could have more shadow so you can enjoy the whole azotea! Great place to go!!
ChIJ5bJ2s4QoQg0RXpYtjKH6Rj8,4,"A cafe inside the iconic building of Cibeles, Azotea, is probably one of the nicest looking cafes in Madrid‚Ä¶ The place has a wonderful service, is very clean, and surprisingly not crowded. I can‚Äôt speak much of the food as I‚Äôve only ordered a merienda(coffee+croissant). The price is ‚Ç¨4.80 which I find reasonable for the location."
ChIJh0OY0IUoQg0RRfd_g5DvJEk,5,"Wow! Arrived promptly at 1pm. Got a table on a cold Wednesday in April. Guess 75% Spanish v Tourists. Set lunch was amazing.  I had green salad tuna and boiled egg. Bottles of virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar were free to use. Came with lovely warm bread roll. Then for main i had Andalusian Cod which came with more nice salad. Then a light sponge with hot chocolate sauce. You get a glass of house wine with it. Actually a small carafe (2 large glasses). Acceptable quality. Obviously go red.

I chose not to have extras like coffee. Without a tip it was just ¬£12.90. Sensational food for that price.

Service and size of the restaurant was very good too. Not packing in too many tables.

Didn‚Äôt try the toilets, but expect they were very clean.

Definitely worth a visit!"
ChIJh0OY0IUoQg0RRfd_g5DvJEk,5,"A wonderful restaurant in the centre of Madrid!
We enjoyed the delicious meals we were served! The staff was polite and helpful!
Very good prices and quality. Highly recommended!"
ChIJh0OY0IUoQg0RRfd_g5DvJEk,4,"No much personal attention from staff. Only two waiters for the whole upstairs so understandable but not making a fancy experience. Luckily we were seated onbtheir way to kitchen so we got orders and reminders through. Food was very tasty, good mouth feel and indeed much!"
ChIJh0OY0IUoQg0RRfd_g5DvJEk,1,"The Seasonal Menu was disappointing. The chicken was served raw, and the tuna tataki was of poor quality‚Äîlacking freshness and overly fatty. Overall, our experience was unpleasant and unappetizing. I cannot recommend this restaurant, as the food was subpar and felt cheap."
ChIJh0OY0IUoQg0RRfd_g5DvJEk,5,"oxtail croquettes were incredible!! highly recommend. Had the baby octopus for main and was very impressed. For dessert we had a selection of the desserts which were also tasty. Amazing value, fabulous service and great atmosphere! Would definitely return"
ChIJ5fIyGo8oQg0RgLi6j0-BZeI,1,"Having enjoyed Thai cuisine across the world‚Äîincluding in Bangkok, Thailand‚Äîwe were excited to try this restaurant offerings. However, we found the food to be lacking in authenticity and, unfortunately, among the least satisfying Thai meals we‚Äôve had.

Given the restaurant‚Äôs Michelin recognition and the premium pricing, we were quite surprised by the quality of the dishes. We were expecting a more authentic and refined experience, but it did not meet our expectations."
ChIJ5fIyGo8oQg0RgLi6j0-BZeI,4,"Krachai Thai offers a true taste of Thailand in Madrid, with its green and red curries as standout dishes. The green curry is rich and aromatic, blending coconut milk with fresh herbs like basil and cilantro for a smooth, balanced flavor. The red curry delivers a bolder spice, perfectly harmonized with sweet and savory notes. Both curries showcase the depth and authenticity of Thai cuisine. Combined with a welcoming atmosphere and attentive service, Krachai Thai is a must-visit for Thai food enthusiasts."
ChIJ5fIyGo8oQg0RgLi6j0-BZeI,5,"This place is a must visit if you enjoy Thai food! We stumbled upon this restaurant while exploring the city and were very lucky to get a table. We both ordered two curries and shared them, along with an amazing desert. Would highly recommend if you‚Äôre in the area."
ChIJ5fIyGo8oQg0RgLi6j0-BZeI,5,"I am Thai and I am living in Madrid. I have to say this restaurant serves absolutely delicious central of Thailand cuisine. My husband loves the Satay Kai, the peanut salsa on top is very flavorful. I love so much the dumpling, it's full of the shrimp. And the Masaman Nua, I'm not a fan of this curry in general but they cook just so perfect! The restaurant looks very nice, clean, beautiful, and friendly staffs. Reasonable price! I highly recommend, don't miss it!"
ChIJ5fIyGo8oQg0RgLi6j0-BZeI,2,"Elegant dinery with food not worth the price.
We went to this elegant place looking for a light dinner- unlike Madeile√±os, we eat relatively early and prefer something light at night. We ordered a dish with a selection of appertifs to share and my partner and I ordered a green papaya salad each- something I love from my years in Laos and Thailand.
The appertifs were ok- nothing extraordinary. The papaya salad was plain disappointing, drowned in peanuts, hardly any lime or tamarind, no shrimps‚Ä¶..just papaya with lotsa palm sugar and fish sauce. And about 15‚Ç¨ for this. Bah
Not returning"
ChIJ2fFEjZooQg0RbySrRH-t_nk,5,"We were group of 4 people and ordered different burgers between pork, meat and veggie and honestly they were all with delicious taste. Definitely recommend place to try."
ChIJ2fFEjZooQg0RbySrRH-t_nk,5,Really good sandwiches and burgers. Amazing Chicken Parm and Friendsgiving sandwiches. The decoration was very nice and the waiters helpful. It's perfect for a casual night date.
ChIJ2fFEjZooQg0RbySrRH-t_nk,5,The food was delicious. We ask for black pepper buger and brisket burger. Both were tasty. The staff were nice and polite. The atmosphere was nice and cozy.
ChIJ2fFEjZooQg0RbySrRH-t_nk,5,"The food is amazing, the atmosphere as well I highly recommend this restaurant!"
ChIJ2fFEjZooQg0RbySrRH-t_nk,4,"The hamburger was good, and I appreciated the friendly service from the girl who helped us. However, it was uncomfortable being served by someone who was clearly sick that day. Also, the mozzarella sticks tasted like they came straight from the supermarket, which was a bit disappointing. Overall, decent experience, but a few things could be better."
ChIJQ8We0YUoQg0RabMe6c34Ud4,5,"A real gem of a place, very castizo, great service, good selections of wines and excellent place for dinner."
ChIJQ8We0YUoQg0RabMe6c34Ud4,5,"Great wine, great tapas. Slightly pricey I must say but authentic place with full of flavors."
ChIJQ8We0YUoQg0RabMe6c34Ud4,1,"we went there back in November and got the tapas menu. The combination of flavours was poor, old fashioned appearance and everything was deep fried. So we felt very unhealthy afterwards. There was a complete absence of salads in the menu. The sherry we were served was poor. We could hardly drink it. Admittedly the ambience was nice, but a bit touristy. I live in London and the quality of tapas you can get here is much higher than this restaurant. For the similar price you can eat and drink much better at Copita in London."
ChIJQ8We0YUoQg0RabMe6c34Ud4,1,"The food is admittedly good but the service is inattentive (verging on the dishonest). After asking twice for a dessert wine I wasn‚Äôt eventually served one, and we the realised they had added it to the bill anyway. Be very careful."
ChIJQ8We0YUoQg0RabMe6c34Ud4,3,"Salad and fried small peppers are good. Black ink rice is alright, nothing spectacular. Garlic prawns very salty (a common problem in South of spain).  Staff is very friendly."
ChIJ9S1EFY8oQg0RhRrMA16LA7o,4,We really enjoyed this restaurant and the food was excellent. Some of the best that Italian that we‚Äôve had in Madrid. The service was also a step up with attention to detail at each opportunity. The only negative was that our table seemed very close to the adjacent table and they kept hitting us. Each dish was cleanly presented and the bread was a fantastic texture and accompaniment.  Mussels were prepared properly and flavorful. Pasta was perfect with an excellent truffle sauce. Overall an excellent experience with extremely clean restrooms. We will definitely return. Cheers!
ChIJ9S1EFY8oQg0RhRrMA16LA7o,5,"Amazing Italian restaurant. Recommended by our hotel and it was a good choice.

Service was good and the restaurant fills up quickly so make reservations. The calzones are delicious. My wife had the bolognese which was awesome."
ChIJ9S1EFY8oQg0RhRrMA16LA7o,5,"Food is as delicious. Prices are reasonable, a pasta dish and one for their pizzas came out to 35 euros. The atmosphere is relaxed with a country side Italian feel. We had a 3 month old baby so they were very accommodating with a high chair and sitting us away from louder guests."
ChIJ9S1EFY8oQg0RhRrMA16LA7o,5,"Amazing Italian food, really tasty and a good price! Really lovely staff, everyone was so welcoming and kind, especially Claudia! Also a lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere, Would really recommend and will be back if we are in Madrid again! Thank you üòä"
ChIJ9S1EFY8oQg0RhRrMA16LA7o,4,"We recently had dinner with friends at this restaurant, and the experience was fantastic. The atmosphere was absolutely wonderful, and the service was exceptional, filled with positive energy. However, the lasagna was a bit disappointing as it lacked depth in flavor and could have used a richer sauce. The Prosciutto e Funghi pizza also could have had a better flavor and combination. Despite this, the overall experience was great. Highly recommend for a delightful evening out!"
ChIJ21uuaYUoQg0Rq2B3pXMNC6g,5,"New owners have changed completely the restaurant and the menu. The environment is peaceful and quiet, service is fast and nice, and food is just delicious. Intense flavors, good products and a very innovative way to mix the ingredients."
ChIJ21uuaYUoQg0Rq2B3pXMNC6g,5,"This is a beautiful restaurant! The waitstaff was very helpful and super accommodating! The AC was out upstairs, and they moved us with no issue. We were going to order from the menu, but they were also able to accommodate us at the last minute for the tasting menu. Everything was delicious, and the service was sublime!"
ChIJ21uuaYUoQg0Rq2B3pXMNC6g,3,"Interesting modern cuisine. Quite tasty and good service but very small serving sizes, except for the solomillo- which is quite decent. Overall I think it‚Äôs teetering on the edge of not being great value for money."
ChIJ21uuaYUoQg0Rq2B3pXMNC6g,3,"We came here for lunch on a week day of summer. Food was decent, portions were fine, and service a bit slow."
ChIJ21uuaYUoQg0Rq2B3pXMNC6g,2,Over priced...small portions amd terrible service
ChIJ62OKUI8oQg0RpotyZWXNyss,5,"Nikos, our waiter,  was very nice and went above and beyond to make our Easter dinner special. When he found out we were celebrating ‚ÄúGreek Easter ‚Äú away from home, he brought us a basket of eggs so we could do the traditional egg breaking game. It was nice to be able to have a conversation in Greek.
The food was delicious! It was a taste of Greece in the middle of Madrid!  And they had the Greek beers we enjoy and ouzo.
I highly recommend this restaurant for the food, service ands atmosphere"
ChIJ62OKUI8oQg0RpotyZWXNyss,5,"Excellent place! Good options for a VERY reasonable price! The food was very flavorful as well! The hummus, tzatziki and the rolls were delicious! The gyro, obviously, excellent and the dessert (Greek yogurt with honey and nuts) was amazing!

All of these things were from the fixed Menu of the day, and shared between 3 people (so we got to try everything).

Go!"
ChIJ62OKUI8oQg0RpotyZWXNyss,5,Great Greek restaurant in the heart of Chueca. They have a wide variety of typical Greek tapas and dishes. Everything was very tasty and of a high quality. We came on a Saturday night without reservation and the staff accommodated us very kindly despite being a group of 8 people.
ChIJ62OKUI8oQg0RpotyZWXNyss,5,"Wonderful, light, tastefully decorated place in a quiet street of a busy area. Lunch menu was delicious, varied and well priced. The meat stuffed eggplant was delicious. Brownie with ice cream was perfect! The service was superb, the waiter is super friendly, positive and attentive and made us feel special and welcome."
ChIJ62OKUI8oQg0RpotyZWXNyss,5,"We absolutely had an awesome Greek meal and amazing gastronomic experience in Kritos. Tho the restaurant is not huge, the nice and lovely ambience and good service made us feel at home. The food we ordered were all super delicious, especially the traditional Greek dish like Mousaka and the Soutzoukakia are really impressive! The TZATZIKI is fantastic as well. The Yogurt cake the chocolate cake made us mouthwatering!  Definitely a nice place for friends or family dinner!"
ChIJjbVCKYkoQg0RmK7QYuiokI8,5,"Very inviting. I was walking down the street and found this place, I could not resist. Yummy cocktails and quesadillas"
ChIJjbVCKYkoQg0RmK7QYuiokI8,5,We went just for drinks and we loved the atmosphere and the drinks ü©∑
ChIJjbVCKYkoQg0RmK7QYuiokI8,5,"I can only speak for this restaurant and lounge from the perspective of one visit during a special event on New Year's Eve.

Fantastic food, great service, and plenty of drinks available. It's an absolutely charming locale."
ChIJjbVCKYkoQg0RmK7QYuiokI8,5,"Amazing. I loved the ladies and the bar staff was great. The female waitresses didn‚Äôt look as happy as the men. It took about 2 hours to get our 2nd plate of food so we were STARVING. The drink selection is great. Overall, amazing experience. Food was good too btw."
ChIJjbVCKYkoQg0RmK7QYuiokI8,5,"Excellent time at the Saturday Drag Queen brunch. Great staff, good service, lovely queens, good programming! A+++!"
ChIJJ6-lFZsoQg0RB41S0osPelY,5,"This wonderful Irish pub serves traditional Irish beer in a warm and inviting atmosphere, making it the perfect place to enjoy a drink with friends. The fish and chips were absolutely delicious ‚Äî crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The staff is incredibly friendly, adding to the overall welcoming experience."
ChIJJ6-lFZsoQg0RB41S0osPelY,3,"The fish and chips was very nice, highly recommended. The ribs was also very nice. Service was OK, was waiting a little too long with an empty glass. Also I suspect they use iptv as the match on several TVs was not in synch even though it was the same channel. When I complained about it the waiter just said ""And? What do you want me to do?""."
ChIJJ6-lFZsoQg0RB41S0osPelY,5,"Great place to experience the Irish food available at the place. Great friendly service, very respectful of your presence. No rush to eat, able to enjoy our lunch here. The Beef with Guinness sauce with puff pastry top was delicious and the mashed potato with seasonal vegetables were excellent. Along with a pint of Guinness it went down well. Highly recommended place to eat and visit."
ChIJJ6-lFZsoQg0RB41S0osPelY,5,"Nothing but grand things to say about this place! Everything my friends and I have tried (the beef in guinness sauce, the fish and chips, the nachos, irish breakfast, vegetable wok, the homemade sausages) have been delicious and thoughtfully presented. The ambiance here is great, the staff are kind and the guinness is good! Will definitely continue to return to this gem!"
ChIJJ6-lFZsoQg0RB41S0osPelY,5,"I recently visited the James Joyce Irish Pub and had a fantastic experience.
The food was tasty and delicious, with a great variety of traditional Irish dishes.
The staff were friendly and welcoming, making us feel right at home.
The location is also a highlight, especially the outdoor view, which added to the overall atmosphere.
I highly recommend this pub for anyone looking to enjoy good food and a great ambiance!"
ChIJXf7FfpcoQg0Ryp4nK6mgfw0,2,"My overall experience is more negative than positive. Housekeeping did not adequately clean the room, not even change the bedsheets during our 6 DAY stay. They changed the covers once but not the pillowcases trash was not thrown out, nothing was cleaned properly. Their isolation is bad and we constantly heard noises and other guests. It was 8 degrees and freezing and there was no air-conditioning. I was freezing in the room and had to put on a sweater to sleep. There was ni ventilation also so we had to open the windows constantly to get some air which made jt even more freezing. Breakfast was okay but lack of variety, no salads at all which should be a must. Location is the only thing that is excellent, and the Quintin restaurant right next to the hotel. For our check-out, the receptionist woman told me to pay 80‚Ç¨ for extras, even though we only had 2 waters and a coke for room service. She was very rude and convincing me that 3 of our friends came to breakfast and we had to pay 60‚Ç¨ for their meal. We dont have friends in Madrid, and when i told her it wasn‚Äôt true she started arguing ‚Äúyes it was‚Äù and was very rude. Her colleague stepped in to apologise to me after she crossed the line and was literally trying to convince me a total lie and making me pay for some random people‚Äôs breakfast. I would definitely come to Madrid again, but not at this hotel."
ChIJXf7FfpcoQg0Ryp4nK6mgfw0,5,"Maybe a bit too noise if your room faces the main road, however the hotel‚Äôs contemporary colours and ambience makes it a lovely place"
ChIJXf7FfpcoQg0Ryp4nK6mgfw0,5,"Very serviceminded staff, Rebecca and her team made us feel like home. Great drinks from the bar. Cozy breakfast with fresh produce, eggs and coffe made to order. Rooms were big, clean and with comfy beds. Will be back!"
ChIJXf7FfpcoQg0Ryp4nK6mgfw0,4,"The rooms are good and clean, the service is nice. You can't beat the location is  great!
The only bad thing I can say is that  it's a bit noisy."
ChIJXf7FfpcoQg0Ryp4nK6mgfw0,5,"Even before we checked in, the staff brought a baby bath to the room for our child without us asking. Excellent service. üëèüèª"
ChIJ8bkrzJYoQg0RHQnvVKetod8,5,"This hotel is great! Perfectly located, rooms are comfortable and the breakfast buffet is over the top nice. But the biggest compliments are for the reception staff, who always greet you with a smile, remember your name and offer any kind of support you could need. Thank you!"
ChIJ8bkrzJYoQg0RHQnvVKetod8,5,"Great hotel for a stay right on the upscale shopping avenue Calle Serrano. Well designed throughout all areas, and with staff that shows great care and dedication. Breakfast variety and quality was very good. On the downside, rooms and hallways show signs of wear and tear so I hope the hotel finds ways to keep the experience consistent with the pictures and expectations."
ChIJ8bkrzJYoQg0RHQnvVKetod8,5,"This hotel is in an excellent location. Very posh neighborhood. And very quiet as well. Easy to find taxis etc. The hotel seems to be an older fully renovated building. It is very tastefully done. Very boutique feel. The staff is as nice as they come. My favorite was one of the gents serving at the bar, and of course Noemi at the front desk. Potentially the halls can get noisy as sounds carry, but its not a constant thing. The rooms are spacious, big bathrooms, very neat and clean, as is the bed. The lobby bar is quite quiet, which is wonderous for times I was doing work, but some people watching would also be nice - for that, they also set  up a patio outside. It was far too cold for me on this trip, but im sure in the summer I could be out there for hours. Feel like an Icon, at the Embassy!"
ChIJ8bkrzJYoQg0RHQnvVKetod8,3,"I personally wouldn't rate this a 4-star hotel. It was okay. Attention to detail lacking. I'd go with the ICON Wipton if you're chain loyal. Otherwise, go with another option in Salamanca. Lots of better choices.

Here's why:

Location is excellent. Especially if you like to shop!

Bed was firm so be forewarned if that's not your favorite mattress type.

First two mornings breakfast was ready on time. When we checked out at 7:00 am, there was only some fruit and smoothies available so that was disappointing -- breakfast was the only redeeming feature about this hotel.

Cafe on the sidewalk is far too noisy to have a conversation. Service was painfully slow.

Bathroom is small and again, details lacking. And our shower drain was clogged. Despite reporting it, never fixed.

AC in one room had a bad sensor so changing the temp meant you had to do the opposite of what you wanted. Maintenance said he'd be right back but he never returned. We knew the trick so managed during our stay."
ChIJ8bkrzJYoQg0RHQnvVKetod8,5,"I am writing this review to share my experience and recommend this hotel. This hotel is located in the center of Serrano shopping/restaurant spots- 20 min from the airport. Check in process is smooth. I checked in prior to arrival once they sent me a form to complete so this made check in process quicker. Once we arrive check in took about 15 min we where handed keys and then went straight to the room to freshen up. We were welcomed by a clean well organized room. After freshening up we went straight to walk down serrano and goya. So many restaurants, shops to choose and enjoy. After the walk we reached the hotel quickly since its so central which makes it so convenient. The next morning we enjoyed a full service breakfast buffet. We enjoyed the perk of shopping and coming back every now and then to drop the bags and freshen up/ even nap then go out for dinner. Same the following days. One morning I ask my coffee in the room because I wasn‚Äôt feeling well this was also to my satisfaction. In summary, excellent location, excellent service, excellent breakfast, excellent clean rooms. Now I understand why this hotel has so many good reviews. Well done."
ChIJmzxvx5koQg0RRLZ2YkHb1g4,2,"The service was disappointing and the waiter was rude. The atmosphere is nice and even on the chic side. Locals like this restaurant, I was surrounded by Spanish speakers. The ceviche was yummy, as well as the mini burgers and the ham. I wouldn‚Äôt come back due to the service."
ChIJmzxvx5koQg0RRLZ2YkHb1g4,1,"5 Stars for the food! Mini burgers were good aslo salad and pasta!

BUT! I attached the picture of the table as well, when we asked it was empty and the manager said no. When were leaving it was also empty! So 1 star.."
ChIJmzxvx5koQg0RRLZ2YkHb1g4,4,"Great place to have nice food and environment! The aesthetics of the restaurante are nice and cozy. The atmosphere is a bit elegant and classy , but is also a nice place to go for drinks with your friends.

We went to have a nice dinner so for starters we order some mini burgers. They had really good taste and its sweet caramelizad onions were the punch to the burger.  We continued with a Lomo de Vaca /beef steak which was cooked with precision and perfect cooking point.  Deserts were good but maybe a bit too sweet. However, I really recommend this place for you to go , either with your couple or or with some friends to have some drinks."
ChIJmzxvx5koQg0RRLZ2YkHb1g4,3,"I would only go back for a drink. The brunch was not very good, pancakes a bit cold and old, salmon not very fresh. Th√© place however very Nice and excellent location."
ChIJmzxvx5koQg0RRLZ2YkHb1g4,4,"A nice restaurant at Salamanca area, it is famous for Sunday brunch and preferred by the locals.  We had a great lunch and a nice dry white wine among an interesting wine list.Friendly welcome and staff."
ChIJx5fUpZkoQg0R5NSkn7RBq4A,3,"The place is original, it looks like a small town Texas Burger, full of flags and pictures, with a few Spanish references. If you look for a fancy burger or some food fusion, keep walking. But if you look for a good old fashioned US burger, that's your place. The food is tasty, and the fries and sweet potato fries are delicious. The biggest issue for me was that the chef has forgotten a plastic under the meat of my burger. So, when I had a bite, I pulled this plastic with my tooth out of the burger. Quite a disagreeable experience. I have a strong stomach so I have just put it aside but I imagine other people could have throwed-up. I just told the waiter to tell the chef to be cautious with this. No effort made on the bill for this bad experience, we paid the burger full price. The mini pudding was good. The mini cheesecake tasted like supermarket food. The garlic bread with cheese made with burger bread was funny and minimalist."
ChIJx5fUpZkoQg0R5NSkn7RBq4A,3,"Not Worth a Third Chance

This was my second (and definitely last) visit to Alfredo‚Äôs Barbacoa, and unfortunately, it confirmed my doubts. I ordered the 4th of July Super Alfredo Burger, supposedly one of their recommended options, but it turned out to be a poor choice. The patty was just a dense, medium-hard ball of ground beef ‚Äî lacking both flavor and juiciness. The baconaisse and crispy onion did little to elevate it, and I honestly can‚Äôt even recall if it had cheese. For a +‚Ç¨17 burger, I expected much more. Even the bun was underwhelming ‚Äî a basic sesame seed bread that didn‚Äôt stand out in any way.

I also tried the coleslaw, which was just okay, and finished with the oreo cheesecake, which was overcooked and dry ‚Äî far from the creamy richness one would hope for.

After two visits and 2 years apart I felt the same way, disappointed. I can say this place just doesn't live up to the hype. There are far better burger spots in Madrid for the price and quality."
ChIJx5fUpZkoQg0R5NSkn7RBq4A,5,"Delicious burger and salad and fries ! We came here for lunch based on Google reviews after a long morning at the park. It didn‚Äôt disappoint! We loved our salad and burgers.

Staff was friendly and the restaurant had the AC pumping !"
ChIJx5fUpZkoQg0R5NSkn7RBq4A,5,"This place is amazing! The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, and the burgers were packed with flavor. The portions are generous, and the service was quick and friendly. A true gem for barbecue lovers in Madrid!"
ChIJx5fUpZkoQg0R5NSkn7RBq4A,4,"I have mixed feelings about this place. First the good, the hamburgers were delicious, even though to me a bit strange without lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, etc... The service was good, efficient and quick. Now the bad... we ordered some ribs and they were absolutely terrible, cold, and tasted like they were many days old. The deserts were not homemade, and you could taste it. However, they didn‚Äôt charge us for the ribs when we told them how bad they were. The place is very small and felt a bit claustrophobic, but still had a quaint air about it. So why rate it 4 stars? Great burger and good service."
ChIJTz8O5JkoQg0R60u5D3X11EM,5,"I stumbled upon this restaurant by chance while walking through the area, feeling quite hungry. Although I didn‚Äôt have a reservation, the staff welcomed me warmly and promptly found a table for me, which I truly appreciated. From the moment I arrived, the atmosphere was inviting and full of positive energy.

The ambiance was exceptional‚Äîperfect for families, with children, parents, and grandparents all enjoying Easter Friday together. It was heartwarming to witness several families gathered for what appeared to be meaningful reunions, which added to the overall warmth and charm of the experience.

The service was outstanding. Every staff member I encountered was professional, attentive, and genuinely friendly. As for the food‚Äîit exceeded all expectations. Every dish was flavorful, beautifully presented, and clearly made with care. I found myself savoring each bite and appreciating the quality and creativity in every aspect of the menu.

This experience left such a great impression that I‚Äôm already planning to return with my own family for Easter Sunday. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for excellent food, exceptional service, and a welcoming environment. Without hesitation, a true hidden gem! I recommend it 150%."
ChIJTz8O5JkoQg0R60u5D3X11EM,5,Very comfortable and gourmet restaurant in downtown Madrid! All the food is well presented and you have wonderful choice! Not so much expensive. I‚Äôd really recommend!
ChIJTz8O5JkoQg0R60u5D3X11EM,4,"Atmosphere was a bit more formal vs what you would expect from Andalusian. But very nice decor, and friendly service. A bit expensive vs value."
ChIJTz8O5JkoQg0R60u5D3X11EM,5,Stopped in with dinner with colleagues.  Great food and service.  Grilled hake was excellent.
ChIJTz8O5JkoQg0R60u5D3X11EM,5,"A supreme experience - if you are an  Andalusian food lover, this will become your place in Madridüòé

Everything in the menu is excellent and they have tons of gluten free options which makes the place Celiac Safe ü•≥"
ChIJDUGWzaIoQg0RMJC-4V7CdWI,5,Relaxed and convivial! It is a great place for an afterwork drink and bite.
ChIJDUGWzaIoQg0RMJC-4V7CdWI,5,"Perfect for burger Soho, entra√±a, super friendly staff"
ChIJDUGWzaIoQg0RMJC-4V7CdWI,5,"Muy rico! Perfect nachos, perfect burger, great service and very cozy place üåπ Thank you"
ChIJDUGWzaIoQg0RMJC-4V7CdWI,1,"Very arrogant and rude owner. I don't recommend big groups or birthday celebrations here. Long story short, they charged us 45 euros just to bring out our own cake (which we had brought from outside) and put on the table. Even though we had spent a good amount of money on food and drinks.  And at several occasions they were very negative and not welcoming. Specially the owner (Don't know his name)."
ChIJDUGWzaIoQg0RMJC-4V7CdWI,5,"Food is really good, up stairs the waitress is very friendly (and beautiful). Our drinks served within seconds and food within minutes with great taste."
ChIJ52IGRJgoQg0R4_jzow_Nbcs,5,"Lovely, plush hotel in the Salamanca district of Madrid. Rooms are large with excellent facilities. My room even had a small balcony which overlooked the internal atrium.
Reception staff we‚Äôre polite and efficient.
Breakfast had a wide choice of foods of great quality.
Only negatives were that the lifts were slow and small. The smell from huge bouquet of Lilly‚Äôs in reception are overbearing, but I have allergies."
ChIJ52IGRJgoQg0R4_jzow_Nbcs,5,Fabulous hotel with lovely old world ambiance and service. Great location-close to shops restaurants and museums. Very quiet rooms with tea and coffee making facilities. Also nice to have a pool and spa
ChIJ52IGRJgoQg0R4_jzow_Nbcs,3,"Very old-school place, a little bit shabby, definitely traditional. It‚Äôs in a great neighborhood though, with easy access to shopping and you can also go is the Prado very easily."
ChIJ52IGRJgoQg0R4_jzow_Nbcs,5,"I was there just for drinks on a business meeting. I did not stay there so I cannot talk about accomodations. What I can tell you is that it is a beautiful hotel, very classic and very elegant. The bar is cozy with leathered seat in a very british style and the drinks are generously pourred. The staff is very friendly and they have excellent bartenders"
ChIJ52IGRJgoQg0R4_jzow_Nbcs,5,Food is great quality and the service is fabulous..the room is nice..the beds..the breakfast..eveything is nice..location is very good as well
ChIJt1m7hJEoQg0R_p9BG16_ccg,5,"Really nice place, the food is wonderful, everything was great. There are some tacos with duck that were delicious (didn‚Äôt take a picture). Also the service was so great, our waiter was so friendly and mostly all the people were very nice. A really nice surprise to meet upon this place. 100% recommend."
ChIJt1m7hJEoQg0R_p9BG16_ccg,5,"It‚Äôs a great place, not only is it simple but nicely decorated, but the service is outstanding and the food is fresh and so tasteful you will want to keep going without a doubt! The olives to start off with are the most amazing ones I have ever had and the rest was simply fresh, light and great!"
ChIJt1m7hJEoQg0R_p9BG16_ccg,5,"Really liked this place and will definitely return. I have a very good experience with restaurants part of the Tragaluz group from Barcelona and this was no different.

We went quite early (for Madrid) but their pre-dinner menu is very good. Tried croquetas and the duck tacos and they did not disappoint. The desserts were delicious, especially the flan which was probably the best flan I have tried.

Service was very friendly and relaxed and the place is just genuinely very nice. Look forward to going again."
ChIJt1m7hJEoQg0R_p9BG16_ccg,5,"This modern Spanish restaurant in Madrid is hands down the best Spanish dining experience I‚Äôve ever had. The patatas bravas with egg and shrimp were a standout‚Äîinnovative and full of flavor - make sure you mix the potato and the sauce. The chargrilled steak was perfectly cooked, and the Ensaladilla rusa (Russian salad) was a delightful surprise. The quality of the food, combined with the modern twist on classic Spanish dishes, made for an unforgettable meal. Despite the high quality, it‚Äôs very affordable at just ‚Ç¨30 per person with drinks. For anyone looking for an elevated Spanish dining experience at a great price, this place is a must-visit!"
ChIJt1m7hJEoQg0R_p9BG16_ccg,4,"Went for a lunch on a Sunday afternoon.
Seated by the hostess in a middle table for 2.

Once we put down the menu no one came to ask if we were ready to order. The hostess passed us more than 2 times but didn‚Äôt bother to ask, nor the waitress.

We waited for while, then we decided to call the waitress, and ordered our meals and beverages.

I ordered a glass of wine and she came with a new bottle, poured the wine, spilled some on the table then left. Never came back to clean the spilled wine.

The dishes were delicious, but the service could definitely be better.

We ended up with a male server who was nice and friendly."
ChIJj1Y585soQg0R0JBZO26ObtU,4,"Most of tapas menus were very delicious. However regarding the main menu, I would like to recommend you monkfish menu."
ChIJj1Y585soQg0R0JBZO26ObtU,4,"Great location just outside retiro park. Very friendly service. Food is nice,overpriced. 2 tortillas and 2 drinks are definitely shouldn‚Äôt cost 53 euros."
ChIJj1Y585soQg0R0JBZO26ObtU,3,Got charged for bread we didn't order. Food was average for the price. I think we had better burger and fries at McDonalds. Service was good.
ChIJj1Y585soQg0R0JBZO26ObtU,5,Food was delicious. Took the ceasar salad and croquet for antres. They were perfect. Service was very kind and professional. This is a very good restaurant. I Highly recommend it.
ChIJj1Y585soQg0R0JBZO26ObtU,4,"Amazing international restaurant near Retiro.
The burgers are very tasty and the menu day is very diversified.
I recommend this restaurant after a walk in El Retiro.
I will come back for sure!"
ChIJD88fWoUoQg0RkhUY7QtqTvk,5,"The experience is genuinely delightful. The venue is modest and unassuming, focusing on substance over flashy decor. Instead of an open menu, the restaurant offers a selection of set menus, each presenting a curated array of satisfying choices. While the food is good‚Äîif not extraordinary‚Äîthe true highlight is the performance.

The live show, featuring an eclectic mix of zarzuela, opera, and classic folksy tunes, is both vibrant and humorous, breathing life into the entire setting. The artists, many of whom also serve as waitstaff, exude talent and maintain an infectious positive energy that elevates the evening.

Service is impeccable; our server, Sara, was notably attentive and went the extra mile to ensure our comfort. A friendly tip: if you‚Äôre using a prepaid plan, consider bringing some spare cash for tipping, as it can be challenging to leave an appropriate gratuity otherwise."
ChIJD88fWoUoQg0RkhUY7QtqTvk,5,"I was a bit skeptical about going to this dinner at first as non-spanish speaker. But I was so glad we went to celebrate a birthday. It was such a unique experience!
- Staff there are so lovely and ensured that we were comfortable. They can speak English so that was a big plus!
- We had four courses, and they were all so delicious!
- They sing opera beautifully. It was so memorable. We were incredibly lucky to be there at low season so it was not so crowded.
- The owner came out to ensure we were happy with everything.

In summary, foods are great, staffs are incredible and very talented. If you want romantic and enjoyable candle-lit dinner for special occasion, I highly recommend this shop!"
ChIJD88fWoUoQg0RkhUY7QtqTvk,5,A lifetime experience. Forget all other shows. Fantastic food and wine. Fantastic performance. Full of real emotions. No faking for tourists. Will never forget it.
ChIJD88fWoUoQg0RkhUY7QtqTvk,5,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

The singing at this restaurant was absolutely amazing! I was blown away by the talent and energy of the performers. To top it all off, they invited everyone to come out and dance at the end, which made the night even more special. The combination of fantastic music and delicious food created an unforgettable experience. Highly recommend for a fun and memorable evening!"
ChIJD88fWoUoQg0RkhUY7QtqTvk,5,A very enjoyable evening with the opera songs performed as you dine. Staff very attentive and can sing as well. Great multi tasking! Would highly recommend to opera lovers and those keen to hear famous arias.
ChIJpWlI08QoQg0RXJi7Rzb0tvk,5,"Tampu is an absolute must-visit for anyone looking to experience exceptional Peruvian cuisine in Madrid. Every dish I tried was amazing and unique, full of bold flavors and creativity. Even something as simple as plain rice had an incredible taste and aroma, showing the attention to detail in every element of the meal.

Two standout dishes for me were the shrimp dish, which was perfectly balanced and full of flavor, and the chocolate dessert, which was simply divine. Every bite was a delight!

I highly recommend taking the tasting menu‚Äîit‚Äôs the best way to experience the depth and variety of flavors that Tampu offers. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of Peruvian food or trying it for the first time, this restaurant is a must. Can‚Äôt wait to return!"
ChIJpWlI08QoQg0RXJi7Rzb0tvk,5,"Nice Peruvian restaurant in Madrid. We went for their d√©gustation menu with wine pairing (65+30 euros). This was wow! Great discovery of Peruvian dishes with sea food (sea bass, mussel, scallops) and pork. The ratio quality price is very high! The ceviche was the highlight and a big coup de c≈ìur of this menu in seven rounds."
ChIJpWlI08QoQg0RXJi7Rzb0tvk,5,I moved to Madrid last November and my temporary apartment was next to Tampu. I've been to this restaurant 12 times so far...it is my favorite one in Madrid. The gentleman name Lino who receives you at the door is the nicest person and in this last visit I had the pleasure to meet the chef Miguel that apart from being very talented is also lovely! Congratulations Tampu!
ChIJpWlI08QoQg0RXJi7Rzb0tvk,5,"Our experience was fabulous. They were so accommodating and cordial. The staff was so friendly and helpful, always with a smile and with great English, which helped a lot. We definitely recommend it and will be back for sure."
ChIJpWlI08QoQg0RXJi7Rzb0tvk,5,"This restaurant js wonderful with very smiling staff and amazing aromatic food. All ceviche da worth trying, each one unique in its own way, for instance ceviche verto norte√±o surprises with its coriander flavour and corvina a lo macho whit its rich seafood.
When it comes to main courses, cuello de cerdero melts in your mouth and pachamanca de picant√≥n kills with its richness in different spices. Thank you Tamil for your warm hospitality, and see you next time!"
ChIJ6ZjCSpooQg0RCPxB___15g4,4,"Food was good, pricey however. Started with the Calamarcitos, and it was fantastic.

I got the menu of the day which was great value for money. The serving for the appetizer and the main was relatively small but was great nonetheless. The desert was unbelievably good.

The service was outstanding as well. Overall, experience and atmosphere was great. Food was pricey but still great quality."
ChIJ6ZjCSpooQg0RCPxB___15g4,4,"Conveniently located outside the front door of our hotel, this was an easy choice after a long day of traveling. We wanted a small nibble so just ordered a pizza, salad and fried artichokes. The artichokes were the best we found in Madrid; not too oily or salty and cooked to perfection.

We were full before the pizza arrived so took it home. All were filling."
ChIJ6ZjCSpooQg0RCPxB___15g4,3,"The fish was good, the sauce was good and the vegetable was good, but the combination was bland and boring for this price, 34 euros. And the serving was too small for only 1 main dish.

And the waiter made me believe it was rice in the dish because of the name tagliatele. The name referred to the vegetable and not pasta or rice. And my girlfriend received the wrong order, and in longer time than normal. Overall the experience was only great because my girlfriend got a completely new pizza (though way too late) and as compensation we both received 1 extra drink.

Do I recommend eating here? Yes, but only if you are interested in eating at least 2 dishes, pay a lot of money and not expect big servings. The pizza was ok price and bigger serving though if you are hungry.

The waiters were super kind and helpful, but both of them made big mistakes."
ChIJ6ZjCSpooQg0RCPxB___15g4,5,"Great place, there is something for everyone. The food and drinks were amazing, especially the ravioli and fish. Great service staff speaks many languages and very helpful. Would definitely come here again great food and ambience!!"
ChIJ6ZjCSpooQg0RCPxB___15g4,5,"The terrace has a great atmosphere and beautiful views. Service is very professional and attentive. We only had a cocktail because we were a bit in a rush, but will surely come back! There are some cocktails that were created by the Bartender, one of them is ‚ÄúDe Madrid al Cielo‚Äù (the pink one), strongly recommend it!"
ChIJXaDBkYYoQg0RmlTj1LtaYP8,4,"The place is very nice and full of people. It is not very touristy, but all waiters speak English. The welcome dish was olives, garlic butter and bread which was nice. We got an entree and the paella they are famous for. I discovered the place as the ""best paella place in Madrid"", it was fine. The sangria was very good. The paella for 2 is very big. We ended up not eating it fully, but they don't offer another option (minimum 2)."
ChIJXaDBkYYoQg0RmlTj1LtaYP8,5,"This restaurant is featured in a Japanese guidebook. As expected, it is a high-quality restaurant with delicious food and good service. The paella has an exquisite texture of rice and seafood broth. The omelette is fluffy. We ate and drank until we were full, and the cost of 90 euros for two people was also great."
ChIJXaDBkYYoQg0RmlTj1LtaYP8,1,"Expensive and not worth the price. Many people recommend this restaurant;however, I hold a different opinion. The food is so salty. The olive has pit inside. The Paella is very salty and the mussel starter is extremely salty. We did reflect the issue immediately to the manager; but he claimed this is normal. As a fine dining restaurant, they are fail in those basic etiquette. I do need to warn those who have kidney issues. Very salty food on their menu
Instead I  recommend you others  like La Bola. They have much better food and services. At least, La Bola makes you a pleasant dinning experience."
ChIJXaDBkYYoQg0RmlTj1LtaYP8,5,"Beautiful ambiance, and the best gazpacho and paella I‚Äôve ever had. Our Spanish host said the taste is like what her mother makes, which is the highest praise indeed. Special mention to Lina, our wonderful waitress who took such good care of us."
ChIJXaDBkYYoQg0RmlTj1LtaYP8,5,Amazing paella. Delicious starter and dessert. The staff was all super nice. Had a great experience here. Will come back again
ChIJuWPWfJcoQg0Rhz9ooe-4lzc,5,"Went there on a Friday night with no reservations, I got welcomed so well and taken care of. Really nice service which is as important as the meal for me. Also the food was simple and tasty, hot and comes in good portions. From the bread to the little espresso, I enjoyed everything. I will come back."
ChIJuWPWfJcoQg0Rhz9ooe-4lzc,5,"It's one of the best restaurants in Madrid. I always order the verdinas whenever they're there. The service is excellent, and they have a very good wine list. For dessert, the yogurt ice cream is addictive."
ChIJuWPWfJcoQg0Rhz9ooe-4lzc,4,Great options on the menu. With some really good recipes like the artichokes and the mushrooms with truffle and foie gras which is delicious and incredibly light yet tasty. Service was on point and the atmosphere was good too. A bit too pricey though so the lack of the 5 stars
ChIJuWPWfJcoQg0Rhz9ooe-4lzc,4,"Went on a lovely spring day. Nice patio though cramped (though not very busy) - could barely move my chair away from the table given service area directly behind. There was also an odd leg on the table so while I‚Äôm a fairly petite woman, it wasn‚Äôt a very comfortable chair. The food was wonderful. The jam√≥n y pan de tomate, ensalada con aguacate y lasagna (pheasant) y tarta de manzana. The service was ok. Some friendlier than others. Felt like we weren‚Äôt a priority to them compared to the other American next to us talking about her boob job‚Ä¶. Bread was nice as well as little appetizer but charging 5.5E per person for the bread and appetizer without disclosing was interesting. Being unable to refill water, when tap water is standard in madrid, also weird. And then paying 10% tip on the most expensive restaurant we have found yet in madrid (and we went for lunch) all felt a bit meh. It was great food but the service wasn‚Äôt superb. The table was sub par. And the nickel and dime-ing on bread and tip leaves a bad taste in your mouth, regardless of quality of food. Madrid has great food and while this was great, not paying 3xs more great in my opinion. I also incorrectly expected a roof terrace vs sidewalk cafeü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
ChIJuWPWfJcoQg0Rhz9ooe-4lzc,4,"Excellent option for an upscale meal. A little overpriced considering the food in Madrid is great in any place. This is mostly for tourists or high scale locals. Even with a reservation they make you wait for a table but is totally worth it, specially when the kitchen is open at all times, not only 2-4pm.  Really hard to find parking; so if driving consider that before going."
ChIJZXDgI4QoQg0Rw_val6MFQwc,4,"Ordered a Fideau paella; it was good albeit a little too salty. The amount of seafood ingredients were considered generous. However, other than the food, the rest were off.

The restaurant had a very dated decoration, and maybe they did not have enough paella pans??? They showed the paella to us for a glance and took it away for plating. And they do that for all the customers. The server ‚Äúhighly recommended‚Äù the white sangria which of course was much more expensive than the red. Also note that the water and bread that they ‚Äúautomatically‚Äù offered were chargeable.

Food pricing generally higher than the other restaurants. Service wasn‚Äôt the best as well as it took 3 requests for them to finally give the bill. Feels a little like a tourist trap. Overall it‚Äôs a possible option to consider if you want to eat Paella in Madrid."
ChIJZXDgI4QoQg0Rw_val6MFQwc,5,The black rice paella was delicious! The service was excellent and gambas al ajillo was outstanding! Definitely will come again. :)
ChIJZXDgI4QoQg0Rw_val6MFQwc,5,Yes eat there.  Yes the Paella is great. Go big and try squid ink!!  The owner works hard and it pays off. Beyond delicious.
ChIJZXDgI4QoQg0Rw_val6MFQwc,3,"Visited after reviews. Overall, was good.
Tips: 1. they serve you a bread and butter per person, without asking, then charging you. So if you don‚Äôt want bread, tell them.
2. Sangria is their signature. If you want to just try, then order by a glass. It didn‚Äôt pair well with a food."
ChIJZXDgI4QoQg0Rw_val6MFQwc,5,"Love the food, the best Paella I had out of 4 places. Amazing lady that runs it. Great orange juice - I recommend."
ChIJhWfa4IUoQg0R6r8E0pY8AUE,5,The food was good. The staff very attentive. We love squid and ordered in two different ways. They were good.
ChIJhWfa4IUoQg0R6r8E0pY8AUE,4,A fancy tapas restaurant in Madrid. Located near the Chuecca area. It's a hidden gem. It's on the rooftop of a local market. It has an amazing view and decorations. The food was tasty and good looking. The prices were reasonable. I didn't know it existed if it wasn't for my local friend who took me there. I highly recommend it. It's a great dining experience and one of the most affordable ones.
ChIJhWfa4IUoQg0R6r8E0pY8AUE,2,"Lovely food, awful service

Arrived at 13:05, and stood around not greeted. Two groups behind us were then sat (they don‚Äôt allow reservations, so this was confusing).

Had to ask twice for menus. Including the manager
Had to ask three times to order.
Asked for a second glass of wine FOUR times, and never got it.

Eventually ran out of time as the main course (we asked for the food all at once), arrived at 13:52, so I had to leave my colleague to eat the main course and dessert on their own.

Really poor experience, but the food I tasted was lovely."
ChIJhWfa4IUoQg0R6r8E0pY8AUE,5,"Visited the terazza twice while in Madrid! Great service and even better food! Definitely recommend 10/10
Reservations are not required, if you show up, you will find a table. We were a party of 20 and they still managed to seat all of us. Both fish and meat options are great, not a single thing we tried from the menu was anything but excellent"
ChIJhWfa4IUoQg0R6r8E0pY8AUE,5,"Everything we eat are very very very delicious ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, pimiento patron, cheese y octopus caserole, croquetas, hamburger, avocado y burrata salad was perfectooo!!! Sangria is the best ever I drink until now. Ambiente is also nice... after flamenco show, we found here by chance. We advise here to everybody"
ChIJ1WPA3YMoQg0RV1Qy4Zg2MrA,5,Excellent restaurant. The food was incredible. We sat outside on the terrace with heat lamps and it was adorable. Our meals were excellent. My partner had their cheesecake which is literally a cake made of cheese. I did not care for it but he said it‚Äôs the best thing he‚Äôs ever had! So if you like Brie‚Ä¶ this is the cake for you.
ChIJ1WPA3YMoQg0RV1Qy4Zg2MrA,5,"Excellent and elaborate Spanish cuisine.
The menu and wine list are carefully crafted to suit the most demanding palate.
And the service is always outstanding, year in and year out‚Ä¶ The restaurant is one of my favorites in Madrid"
ChIJ1WPA3YMoQg0RV1Qy4Zg2MrA,5,"We came here in a small group to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of our course in Humanities at the Universidad de Mayores/Senior University Comillas-ICADE-ICAI, starting at 14.00 and finishing some 4 hours and a lot of good food & conversation later!

We had a fixed menu with shared starters and a good choice of mains. The starters were excellent, especially the croquetas and the tortilla espa√±ola in clam sauce. For the main course, among other appetising options, I chose the classic Armando (a thin fillet steak fried in breadcrumbs) which covered the entire plate alongside small portions of caramelised onion and sliced potatoes. The desserts were equally good and the wine too. A real celebration in a classic restaurant which is always full!"
ChIJ1WPA3YMoQg0RV1Qy4Zg2MrA,5,Amazing food and atmosphere. I would absolutely recommend this place.
ChIJ1WPA3YMoQg0RV1Qy4Zg2MrA,1,"Horrible experience! As we walked in they almost did not want to honour our reservation.
The waiters were arrogant and slow, the food mediocre at best for the price. Some dishes even gross to look at (see photos)
The same waiters were all smiles at some tables but were slamming every thing on our table. Could it be motivated by race because some of us are not white enough? Totally disgusting and unacceptable attitude.  Go at your own risk!!!"
ChIJF3rLUr0oQg0RwmMhLJdLUaE,5,"Delicious food, excellent service! The steak was exceptional."
ChIJF3rLUr0oQg0RwmMhLJdLUaE,4,"This is a classic traditional place,  unlike the young chic restaurants down the road.  Some of their dishes are excellent.  We especially loved the crispy suckling pig , duck ravioli and the baked scallop on the shell."
ChIJF3rLUr0oQg0RwmMhLJdLUaE,5,"A great restaurant. Top-class food. There is a very diverse menu where you will find hare and pigeons, oxtails and veal kidneys and much more. Mille feuille is the best of the best.  10 out of 10. Excellent service. I highly recommend this restaurant."
ChIJF3rLUr0oQg0RwmMhLJdLUaE,4,"Difference choices of French and Basque cuisine. We liked everything we ordered and products are definitely high quality.
Decoration and service very amenable.
The only catch for me are portion sizes, which could be more generous.
Recommended for family and friends gatherings."
ChIJF3rLUr0oQg0RwmMhLJdLUaE,5,"Good service, cosy ambience like a family kitchen, food is definitely impressive. Though pricy, it‚Äôs worth. Highly recommended if you want a high-quality meal. You can start dinner at 2000 which is very convenient for people who prefer early dinner."
ChIJ7x8ki5soQg0RnRoop03tKas,4,"The last surviving classic luxury restaurant of Madrid with a centenary tradition and serving genuine central-European recipes with excellent execution in the kitchen and very attentive and professional service. Classic elegant ambiance and decor. Excellent game dishes in season. Souffl√© potatoes also great. While I really like their famous baumkuchen, I think there is room for upgrading their dessert offerings.
Update January 2025: this time the experience was a bit disappointing so I am adjusting down the rating. The food quality remained high but presentations were on the rough side, not aligned with the elegance of the place. Service has significantly deteriorated in many ways: had to ask a few times for my wine glass to be refilled, dishes that don‚Äôt come out at the same time, final preparations like a flamb√© not performed table side. Finally the atmosphere has also gone down, cramming too many tables in the main dining area, making it very busy for the waiters and diners. Elegant dress code is no longer enforced, just a jacket needed."
ChIJ7x8ki5soQg0RnRoop03tKas,5,"Fantastic place! One of the oldest restaurant in Madrid! I was surprised from the first seconds about service and place! They take care about you from the first moment, took car for parking, opened all doors, put a pillow under the hills (only for women)üòâ, in the end put car in front of door! Service was excellent in all details! Food was very tasty, fresh and well cooked!  Classical, high class restaurant which have rules about dress-code. Man should be with jacket for sure and also not casual style for all persons! Thanks a lot for all staff for amazing atmosphere, delicious food, excellent service and emotions!!! Highly recommend!!!"
ChIJ7x8ki5soQg0RnRoop03tKas,3,"The service is great, very friendly and attentive staff, great wine. The food was awful. The crudit√©s was dry and old. My fish had horribly cooked skin that was not near crispy, potatoes good. Tomato with the fish was just like tomato paste from a can, extremely dense. Herb oil was good but sparse. Minimal seasoning. The fish was edible but only parts of it. I hate flabby skin with no texture on fish. Butter came in water as ice melted. Dessert was dense with little relief. The flavors were not melded well on any dish. There was a lack of texture or a diversity of senses like you would pay at a restaurant of this price and quality. Atmosphere and staff were excellent. The food was just so below par. Edible but lacking flavor, texture and all extremely dense with little relief. Beautiful restaurant but food lacks depth nor a sense of balance from flavor to textures."
ChIJ7x8ki5soQg0RnRoop03tKas,5,"El Horcher is one of the few classic restaurants with French haute cuisine from the 90's that Madrid has, since the disappearance of the legendary Zalacain, Principe de Viana, Las Cuatro Estaciones, Club 31 and Fortuny.

Its food continues to be impeccable, in an elegant and refined space, with first-class service and classic French cuisine dishes.

Without being able to stop trying the excellent butter, to start we taste some artichoke bottoms stuffed with mushrooms and a great foie and truffle dumpling, something perfect to share. Mainly its famous steak tartare prepared to perfection. For dessert, the delicious and unbeatable Cr√™pes Suzette.

To go every week or at least twice a month, for French cuisine lovers."
ChIJ7x8ki5soQg0RnRoop03tKas,3,We went with a close menu. Expectations were high. Food was EXTREMELY disappointing. I‚Äôm guessing buying from the carta would have been different.
ChIJf-4JLZEoQg0RZXo4voYR49Q,5,"Wonderful Place, great staff"
ChIJf-4JLZEoQg0RZXo4voYR49Q,5,Great food in a nice area of Madrid. Will go again.
ChIJf-4JLZEoQg0RZXo4voYR49Q,5,Great food and great service
ChIJf-4JLZEoQg0RZXo4voYR49Q,5,"Central and accessible, spacious and timeless, where quality is perceived only upon entering.
Signature cuisine with excellent raw materials.
Professional and attentive service that takes care of even the smallest detail.
Extensive menu and wine cellar, but you have to let yourself be advised by the maitre d' because the seasonal dishes are excellent.
A gastronomic experience from which you leave with the decision to return as soon as possible."
ChIJf-4JLZEoQg0RZXo4voYR49Q,5,"It is a place located on the first floor of 25 Serrano Street, where culture, gastronomy and tourism come together with the purpose of bringing into contact, relationships and exchange between reality and the people of Madrid and La Rioja. It was founded in 1901.
We came to enjoy the gastronomy because they had spoken very well to us about their restaurant and the truth is that it did not disappoint us.
üòãüòãüòãüòã
We had several dishes to share and thus take advantage of trying a variety of dishes.
We decided on:
Tomato and tuna belly salad
White asparagus gratin with hollandaise sauce
Ham and beef croquettes
Piquillo peppers stuffed with beef
Beans in green sauce with conger eel
Stuffed squid in their ink
Suckling lamb chops in their ink
Baked Iberian shank with sweet potato and mushrooms
All accompanied by a good rioja ‚ÄúBeronia - reserva 2017‚Äù
For dessert; fried milk, apple tatin and cheesecake üòçüòç
Everything exquisite. Thank you!!!"
ChIJGZ1FQ5goQg0RnX2RjocHAMM,5,"We had a wonderful experience thanks to Cedric! He was incredibly kind, always smiling, and made us feel so welcome throughout the night. (It was our first experience) His guidance and attentiveness truly elevated our evening and my birthday night.A fantastic service‚Äîthank you!"
ChIJGZ1FQ5goQg0RnX2RjocHAMM,5,"The food was absolutely delicious and I want to especially point out that the sommelier did a great job pairing it with the finest selection of Sake! Japanese Mediterranean fusion, excellent combination. A top recommendation and I will definitely come again"
ChIJGZ1FQ5goQg0RnX2RjocHAMM,5,"selection menu in Ricardo Sanz restaurant !
It was an incredible journey through Japanese flavors, from the opening appetizer to the unique Japanese desserts. Each course was a delightful surprise, showcasing fresh ingredients and masterful execution."
ChIJGZ1FQ5goQg0RnX2RjocHAMM,5,"This was my first experience at a Michelin Star Restaurant. The experience as a whole (Food, Service, Ambiance) was a notch above any other restaurant I've been to. We took the Degustation Menu which included roughly 10 services. Every dish had unique flavour and plating. Most of the fishes were served raw which attest to their freshness. We also had wine/cocktails recommended by the Sommelier. If you are looking for a gastronomic Japanese experience I highly recommend this restaurant."
ChIJGZ1FQ5goQg0RnX2RjocHAMM,5,"My wife and I went to celebrate my birthday and really enjoyed our evening. We ended up not going for the tasting menu because we wanted to try the Wagyu beef, and a couple of other dishes that weren't included, so they helped us design our own tasting menu.

Also the sommelier recomended great wines! I really reccoment the  ""La Inglesa, Fino de Rama"" white wine - best one I ever had.

The sushi was tasty, fresh, and the wagyo beef steak was out of this world.

The only thing thst disappointed us a little was the chocolate desert that was fairly average.

I will definitely go back again to try more dishes."
ChIJL_DKJJAoQg0Rqf12MUnJGwM,5,"This is the best terrace in Madrid without a doubt. You can see the whole city and the atmosphere is amazing, sometime they play live music.

There is a dreesscode casual elegant, they would not let you in if you are dressed sporty or too casual."
ChIJL_DKJJAoQg0Rqf12MUnJGwM,5,"The waiters provide excellent service, making you feel welcome. They thoughtfully offer blankets in case you feel chilly, though the outdoor heaters function effectively. He enthusiastically recommended the cheesecake, detailing its ingredients. When he served it, he mentioned it was prepared especially for me.
The ambiance is elegant, vibrant without being excessive. Good music. The cheesecake is exquisite, and the views of Madrid are stunning. It's an ideal spot to enjoy alone or with friends or family."
ChIJL_DKJJAoQg0Rqf12MUnJGwM,5,"Amazing views, great food and select milieu of people which makes it a great experience. Good option to have lunch and/or just take a drink after lunch in the rooftop, no wrong choice in any case. Lastly, it‚Äôs worth to highlight how nice the staff is, always courteous and helpful."
ChIJL_DKJJAoQg0Rqf12MUnJGwM,2,"Food is NOT GOOD ! compared to the offer there is in Madrid , and even worse compared to the other restaurants own by the same group . Great  service , lovely atmosphere, amazing view. Small portions for being main dishes like the ‚Äúcorvina‚Äù see picture . One of the plates was so cheap : two tiny pieces of dray fish floating in loads of tomato sauce and soaked chips"
ChIJL_DKJJAoQg0Rqf12MUnJGwM,4,"Club Financiero Genova: Where Elegance Meets Madrid's Skyline

Club Financiero Genova, situated in Madrid's financial hub, right across from Plaza Col√≥n, offers a splendid experience. This is the ideal location for a business meeting, an after-work drink, or indulging in tapas while taking in the breathtaking view from the 14th floor. The skyline view here is truly unparalleled.

During the week, it's exclusive for members at lunchtime, but in the evenings and on weekends, it opens its doors to everyone. As soon as you step in, the restaurant exudes class, with tasteful decor and an elegant, cozy color scheme. The service is both kind and professional.

While the food is undeniably good, we had higher expectations for a place of this caliber. The dishes offer a quality experience but fall just short of earning top marks. Perhaps, their specialty lies in meat plates, though our evening was pleasantly complemented by a good rose. They boast a fine selection of local wines and an enticing list of international options.

Price-wise, it's reasonable considering the prime location and the quality of service. Club Financiero Genova is an excellent choice for various occasions, though it might not quite reach the culinary heights one might anticipate from its elegant setting"
ChIJLxFCSo4oQg0RDuMWwMKJBtM,5,"Our very best dinner in Madrid.

The food was absolutely amazing and delicious.
The pasta was so fresh.
The staff gave us the best feeling in the world.
The place decorated beautifully.
Go there!!"
ChIJLxFCSo4oQg0RDuMWwMKJBtM,5,"We had an overnight layover in Madrid and my boyfriend loves Italian food. We came here thanks to the reviews and it did not disappoint!!!We had the mussels, stuffed eggplant, lasagna and spaghetti- the flavor, awesome service by Chris, absolutely everything was amazing!!! We may just have to move to Madrid so we can eat here all the time. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
ChIJLxFCSo4oQg0RDuMWwMKJBtM,5,We found this restaurant when we walked around there. It seems that there are many local fans and you should take a reservation in advance.
ChIJLxFCSo4oQg0RDuMWwMKJBtM,5,"Everything about this place is amazing. Between Flor, Edgar, Chris and the food - I don‚Äôt even know where to begin! (My spanish is very minimal, so I apologize that this is in English.)

We came here twice when we were in Madrid. First for the food and then again for the friends we made.
Out of our two visits we had: mussels, gnocchi, carbonara, spaghetti, & ragu - MUY DELICIOSO!!

Chris helped us with the perfect wine for our dishes and we closed down the restaurant with them telling us about how the chef (Flor) got her start in Madrid. Wonderful people, food and experience. We will be coming back here to visit and eat as soon as we can ü§ç"
ChIJLxFCSo4oQg0RDuMWwMKJBtM,5,"The food is outstanding, but when going with a baby the attention from the staff makes a huge difference. My daughter yesterday was treated better than in any other restaurant in Madrid.
The aperitivo made of boar was fantastic! The pastas cooked to perfection.
It has a simple wine list but good enough for a simple yet well cooked meal!"
ChIJHfkdyNcnQg0RTaFKOejctbU,5,"New location, same best tortilla in town!! ü§©Menu has been updated, but we went for the classics from their original spot in La Latina: Tortilla de Patata And Bu√±uelitos de Espinaca & Cheddar, that didn‚Äôt disappoint!! - Service is still on a learning curve with new staff, but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be up to par in a few months!!"
ChIJHfkdyNcnQg0RTaFKOejctbU,5,"Juana la Loca is an absolute must-visit in Madrid, offering an exceptional dining experience that combines creative tapas with high-quality ingredients. The atmosphere is vibrant yet cozy, making it a perfect spot for a night out with friends or a romantic date.
The menu is a fusion of Spanish tradition with international influences, and every dish is crafted with attention to detail. Some standout choices include the Sardina Ahumada, a beautifully balanced dish, the burrata with tomato and cardamom chutney, and the Bu√±uelos de Espinaca y Queso Cheddar, which are crispy, cheesy, and packed with flavor.
However, the absolute highlight is the Hatzu Tuna Sandwich‚Äîa red tuna fillet breaded in panko, served with kimchi mayo and trout caviar. The combination of textures and umami flavors makes it an unforgettable bite.
The service is attentive and friendly, adding to the overall great experience. With its excellent location and well-curated menu, Juana la Loca is undoubtedly one of the top places to enjoy modern tapas in Madrid. Highly recommended!"
ChIJHfkdyNcnQg0RTaFKOejctbU,5,"Incredible restaurant to have a modern but traditional meal in Madrid. The new place is very nice. Keeping the essence and identity of the restaurant.

Everything is a must!"
ChIJHfkdyNcnQg0RTaFKOejctbU,5,"Juana La Loca offers a nice dining experience, with the tortilla being tasty, but the Hatzu Tuna definitely steals the show as the best dish. You can book for the first shift at 1pm or wait in line for later ones. The restaurant is usually packed, making it hard to secure a table."
ChIJHfkdyNcnQg0RTaFKOejctbU,5,This place is amazing! Great food and great atmosphere! Fredis and Fernanda are absolute best! Very welcoming and nice people around
ChIJs9nR8oUoQg0RbLdy-xeuMqk,3,"Don't get confused with their 2 locations, as they have a more relaxed location and a fine dining spot just down the street.  We at the fine dining location.  We've had mushroom focused restaurants around the world, but we were somewhat disappointed with their mushroom dishes presented here.  Our favorites were actually the non-mushroom dishes including the baby zucchini flowers, steak tartare and cheesecake.  The worst dish was the mushroom with scallops.  Lots of sand and grit from the improperly washed scallops, and the mushroom completely lacked any cooked flavour.  The egg dish only had some truffle flavoring added to it but was barely noticeable.  Our waiter was friendly but not the most helpful in aiding us to choose dishes and he kept saying how he doesn't eat any seafood himself.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine, but somehow we got charge for 3 glasses and when I asked my waiter, he mentioned something about the portions which I didn't really understand and I blew it off as a miscommunication error on my part which I paid for.  Overall a bit of a disappointment of a meal that should be mushroom centric but those being the weakest of their dishes."
ChIJs9nR8oUoQg0RbLdy-xeuMqk,3,"A restaurant dedicated to mushrooms. I went in with a lot of expectations and the variety of mushrooms they had did not let me down.

However, how they were cooked does. We ordered three different kinds of mushrooms and one mixed portion. They all seemed to have the same cook.

The quality of products they use is good- case in point is the olive oil and wines they served.

Even so, the price point is high. This restaurant is a one time experience."
ChIJs9nR8oUoQg0RbLdy-xeuMqk,3,"I saw the high reviews of this place and wanted to try for myself. The food was really good, I particularly love the boletus with fois gras. However maybe I am a foreigner eating alone with no reservation, or I came in during almost closing time at 3pm, or maybe could be the language barrier, the waiter was ""too attentive"" and was always in a rush trying to get my empty plates away. For example, when I just finished my last bite, he asked to take my plates right away as I was still chewing. Even though the food was really good, I probably won't return as I feel like the waiter was in a rush to get me out, making me feel very unwelcomed."
ChIJs9nR8oUoQg0RbLdy-xeuMqk,5,"Wanted something a bit north of all the crowds, so checked online and this looked cool. Made a reservation and rolled in. Everyone was really friendly, service was great. Food was fantastic. Wasn't too expensive. Great for people watching. Would go back."
ChIJs9nR8oUoQg0RbLdy-xeuMqk,5,"A hidden gem in Chueca, this humble mushroom-focused bar charms with its simple decor. Don't miss the Boletus w/Foie ‚Äì a delightful fusion of flavors. A cozy spot to explore unique culinary delights."
ChIJHYoKE6YoQg0RIIc11zyCrcU,5,"Great service, fantastic week day lunch special. Some of the best Indian food I‚Äôve ever had."
ChIJHYoKE6YoQg0RIIc11zyCrcU,5,Great lunch menu on weekdays fora fantastic price! Friendly service by Abdul.
ChIJHYoKE6YoQg0RIIc11zyCrcU,5,"Amazing experience! The food was absolutely delicious‚Äîauthentic, flavorful, and fresh. Our waiter, Abdul, was incredibly friendly and attentive, making our visit even better. Highly recommend!"
ChIJHYoKE6YoQg0RIIc11zyCrcU,5,"This is the second time I have been to this Indian restaurant.  It's walking distance from the metro Ibiza or the Gregorio Mara√±√≥n General University Hospital.

As can be seen from the photos the decoration is colourful yet tasteful - I have never been to India so I am not sure if their decoration is authentic but it definitely feels like it takes you there. The food was nicely presented with various sauces and/or vegetables on top.

The service was fantastic both times that I have been here. This time I was by myself near the door and every time someone came in or out, the door was left ajar. I got up to close it once or twice, then the waiters there made sure I didn't get up again and were on the case.  The food was served quickly and piping hot.

Now for the food, I have been here twice now and this time I had the menu of the day. With this, you get a starter (two Chicken Samosas) which were lovely, a main (Chicken Vindaloo), a side dish: rice or a Naan bread, dessert and a drink. I love spicy food  (although there was a time when I couldn't stand it), the hotter the better!  The taste of the Vindaloo is lovely, although both times I haven't found it that spicy - to a lot of people it is / will be spicy. The first time I made the mistake of thinking that the Phal could be ordered with lamb but here it can't and this time, as it was the menu, I knew what I was getting but still content with the taste.  I ordered the rice and, a beer and a Mango Lassi for dessert - I was a little greedy and ordered a Pashwani Naan, also. As it was the menu it was priced reasonable at around 11,50 ‚Ç¨ plus extra for the Nann bread .

I would definitely recommend this place as it is not overpriced and you get your money's worth. The next time I go, I will be trying the Phal to see if it will blow my mind, as well as, my taste buds!"
ChIJHYoKE6YoQg0RIIc11zyCrcU,5,I recently dined in with my friend at Fathe Pur and the food was absolutely delicious!!  we enjoyed our meals! Thanks to Abdul and the other guy!
ChIJmxAcq6QoQg0RBo4baWSiVY8,5,"This Spanish restaurant offers a vibrant and authentic dining experience. The menu is filled with traditional dishes like chicken, tapas, and perfectly seasoned seafood, each bursting with rich, bold flavors. The sangria is refreshing, and the selection of Spanish wines pairs wonderfully with the food. The staff is attentive and friendly, making you feel like part of the family."
ChIJmxAcq6QoQg0RBo4baWSiVY8,5,"We came there for cochinillo based on the google review. It was really very nice, crispy and delicious. Other food were great too including the grilled sausage, mushrooms, duck confit and steak. Highly recommended."

Special thanks to our waiter Santos who went above and beyond.
Keep it up!"
ChIJAdDzirwoQg0RTO4ZOhuU4Pg,5,One of my favorite restaurants in the world. Everything that came out of that kitchen tasted delicious. The atmosphere and decor is relaxing and rustic and the waiters are smiling and helpful.
ChIJAdDzirwoQg0RTO4ZOhuU4Pg,5,Amazing.   Ropa vieja was the best.  Very recommended.   The food brings back memories from childhood.
ChIJAdDzirwoQg0RTO4ZOhuU4Pg,5,"Historic place. Nice ambient. Staff very friendly. Excellent food. Typical cocido madrile√±o. Desserts are delicious. Good price. I really recommend this place to enjoy ""cocido"""
ChIJ_SuoWaUoQg0R4wWpEFDnT4I,4,"I went to a Real Madrid basketball game, it was one of the best games I've ever been to and I worked for the Toronto Raptors previously. The environment is upbeat and fun. The quality of basketball is also high. My only suggestion would be to have better in seat service as well as lids for beverages as it's quite unsanitary to be in such an environment without one, also walking up and down stairs with an open cup is a bad idea. I would have liked to be able to purchase jerseys from current players as well. Other than that, I strongly recommend it and enjoying yourself! üòâ üòä"
ChIJ_SuoWaUoQg0R4wWpEFDnT4I,5,"We had an amazing experience visiting a Lenny Kravitz concert, everything was so perfectly organized, the arena for the 15k capacity we didn't have any troubles no crowds, the sound, light, security, location, bars with the several drinks availability everything deserves high rates üòú"
ChIJ_SuoWaUoQg0R4wWpEFDnT4I,5,"The WiZink Center in Madrid is an outstanding venue for concerts, sports events, and large gatherings, offering a fantastic experience for attendees. Located in the heart of the city, it‚Äôs easy to access by public transportation, with nearby metro stops making it convenient for both locals and visitors. Inside, the arena‚Äôs design ensures good visibility and acoustics from nearly every seat, providing a great experience for concerts and performances alike. The seating is comfortable and well-organized, with clear signage that makes it easy to navigate even when it's crowded.

The WiZink Center is also known for its excellent amenities. The variety of food and drink options available cater to different tastes, ranging from quick snacks to more substantial meals, and the numerous bars and kiosks help keep lines manageable. For sports events, the energy in the arena is always high, with passionate fans creating an electric atmosphere that adds to the excitement. The staff is friendly and professional, assisting with everything from ticketing to seating with efficiency and courtesy.

Overall, the WiZink Center is a top-tier venue, offering a high-quality experience in terms of comfort, amenities, and atmosphere, making it a fantastic choice for events in Madrid."
ChIJ_SuoWaUoQg0R4wWpEFDnT4I,5,"Wow wow wow.. We went to the Brian Adams concert just a few days ago. This place is excellent. Location, facility, management everything is great. Really really enjoyed everything."
ChIJ_SuoWaUoQg0R4wWpEFDnT4I,4,"It‚Äôs a fantastic venue for concerts and performances, great atmosphere, excellent acoustics, and easy to access. Definitely a top spot for live events!"
ChIJQXUp0qUoQg0Rv9DotsANAuQ,5,"Absolutely love the seafood here. We have travelled Madrid plus Barcelona for 10 days and still found the seafood here top of the list

We‚Äôve ordered king prawns, oysters, scallops and octopus.

Nice staff

Lots of wine selection

Not difficult to reserve seats
online"
ChIJQXUp0qUoQg0Rv9DotsANAuQ,5,"We stayed in the owner‚Äôs Airbnb just in front of this restaurant. We found this restaurant full of customers any time while it‚Äôs open, and most of them are local customers, not the visitors. We thought it must a truly good restaurant certified by the local customers. We decided to try it, and finally went 5 times during our 7 nights of stay. We are very happy that we have done so. We enjoyed all the foods so much we had at this restaurant.The seafoods served at this restaurant are very fresh or live. All the dishes are well prepared with delicate presentations, and very tasty. Also, the prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended. A mast-do in Madrid."
ChIJQXUp0qUoQg0Rv9DotsANAuQ,5,Excellent quality seafood and great service. Staff helped a lot with menu choices and making you feel at home during the experience. I love being able to choose which piece of seafood I want from the bar. Great wines by the glass.
ChIJQXUp0qUoQg0Rv9DotsANAuQ,5,"Every dish we ordered were excellent, but seafood was the star here. Highly recommend the grilled platter (scallops, baby squid and razor clams were standouts), giant prawns and tuna and avocado salad."
ChIJQXUp0qUoQg0Rv9DotsANAuQ,5,"Best octopus I‚Äôve ever had. Fried milk was fine, but the apple pie was really good. Fantastic service!"
ChIJVaqXzrooQg0RtdxlfQiCodI,4,"They open at 12 but do not offer the menu del dia before 1 pm, so your lunch will basically cost twice the price if you come too early. The service was pleasant and the food was quite edible, but there was too much mustard in the tartare."
ChIJVaqXzrooQg0RtdxlfQiCodI,3,"This place looked promising but it actualy dissapointed big time.
Service was good but the dishes were simply put: no fun and almost tasteless.
Somehow they were looking good but they were not done as good as they looked.
Little Prince is an underachiver here unfortunately."
ChIJVaqXzrooQg0RtdxlfQiCodI,5,"Amazing French restaurant close to wizink center. Service was superb, the owner was personally helping out with orders and making conversation. For staters I ordered the Escargots as well as the p√¢t√© and they were both amazing. For main plates we tried the duck and the steak tartar and both didn‚Äôt disappoint. The duck probably wasn‚Äôt a stellar dish but the tartar was one of the best I‚Äôve had in Madrid. We ended the meal with a tarte tatin that was also really good. I will definitely come back and recommend it for anyone craving authentic French food in a very convenient location."
ChIJVaqXzrooQg0RtdxlfQiCodI,5,"We loved it here. Place it‚Äôs a bit narrow but we had privacy while having dinner. Service is impeccable and super attentive. Food was all very good , flavor and execution. I just found the  rilletes a bit greasy , but probably that‚Äôs just me. Last but not least, value for money is insane. 100% recommended."
ChIJVaqXzrooQg0RtdxlfQiCodI,5,"A real French place in the middle of Madrid. For countries that are neighbors you‚Äôd expect way more French restaurants in madrid but that‚Äôs not the case.

These guys are the real deal. A real French season on every dish I tried so far.

If you order just one thing get the onion soup (sopa de cebolla), it‚Äôs one of the best I‚Äôve ever had, and I had a few in Paris."
ChIJiYGFLaQoQg0RJFTGhrAbg_c,5,Very good asturian food. Excellent meats and fish. Good wine list Large portions. Highly recommended
ChIJiYGFLaQoQg0RJFTGhrAbg_c,5,We have been before and ate on the terrace next door but as it was very cold the terrace wasn't open and we ate in the more causal area. The waiter from Marruecos was so nice and helpful and the food was outstanding. Large portions of very authentic Asturian plates.
ChIJiYGFLaQoQg0RJFTGhrAbg_c,5,"Cachopo was great. Beautiful restaurant but the central area can get very crowded and noisy. We also had the croquetas mixtas of cabrales and jam√≥n. Really good. For dessert, we had the cheesecake. A truly wonderful lunch! It required a long siesta to digest all that wonderful food."
ChIJiYGFLaQoQg0RJFTGhrAbg_c,4,"We ordered octopus and black squid rice. The octopus was awesome.  The rice was super tasty, but few squids and shrimps (as mentioned in the menu).
Check the menu. If you don't want to pay for bread, mention it beforehand.  Otherwise, they will give it to you."
ChIJiYGFLaQoQg0RJFTGhrAbg_c,5,"This is one of the very best places in Madrid (I lived there for a year some years ago). Wonderful food: excellent service -- they advised us to share because the portions are big: they didn't need to do that. The atmosphere is wonderful. We cannot say enough about how our last night in Spain, after a month of incredible food and people, was really enhanced by this incredible place. We will be back!"
ChIJd-4jqGUoQg0Ri7UCUr8KiaA,4,"This restaurant has some staff members who speak English and the restaurant takes reservations. Service quality was a little uneven with some staff members who were rather dour and were so keen to clear your cutlery it seemed like they were hurrying you. Some tables were offered a choice of bread but other tables were not, it‚Äôs not clear why.
The food was good, but not exceptional. Their best dish was the prawns with creamy rice. Croquettes were creamy in the centre and crisp on the outside, Torreznos were crispy too."
ChIJd-4jqGUoQg0Ri7UCUr8KiaA,4,"Treze is a fine dining restaurant with a unique menu with very interesting choices, a great deal of seafood choices and for those with not such a large appetite as the portions are small. The quality of the food is excellent and the choices are varied so there should be something for everyone. Having said this, I had everything from the ‚Äúoff the menu‚Äù and all of the special dishes of the day. Although I thought their ingredients and preparations are of a high level quality and standard, I was not impressed. We asked for the main dish which was a part of the Tuna fish that is right behind the head and supposedly very prized but I didn‚Äôt like the texture of that part of the fish. It was slimy and gooey, so not for me or my friend with me either. Neither one of us enjoyed it. We also picked the salad of the day which was a mixture of three types of beans and also Tuna fish (I guess we were really in the mood for Tuna!) and it was fine. We also had a tomato salad that was also fine. I have to say that the service is excellent, the waiters do know their ‚Äúmetiere‚Äù and know how to present and sell the dishes to you, plus they made you feel tended to and taken care of. The atmosphere is nice and elegant but not over the top. It is pricey so be ready for the bill‚Ä¶ Then again, it is a Michelin star restaurant!"
ChIJd-4jqGUoQg0Ri7UCUr8KiaA,4,"I expected more! The service wasn‚Äôt super friendly. The dishes we got were okay, but they were a bit too salty or a bit too seasoned with smoked paprika or simply too raw (we weren‚Äôt even asked how we prefer the meatballs - medium, rare or well-done).

Burrata was perfect!"
ChIJd-4jqGUoQg0Ri7UCUr8KiaA,5,"Recommended by Bib Gourmand as a traditional Spanish tavern, this restaurant's interior is divided into three sections. Starting with the bar and high chair tapas area, it then moves inward to the formal dining area with sofa seating facing an interior garden, and finally, there is a private party dining area. The wait staff and sommelier are very friendly, and they can present the menu and wine list in both English and Spanish.

I tried a half portion of Torreznos, two Croquetas de Bacalao, half portion of Carrillera de Ternera en Guiso Tradicional, Pur√© de Patata y C√©leri, half portion of Molleja de Ternera sobre Manitas, half portion of Molleja de Cerdo y Curry Rojo, and a half portion of Arroz Cremoso con Gamba Alistada. All the dishes were very tasty and full of flavor. My favorite dishes were the Carrillera de Ternera and the Arroz Cremoso because they were rich in flavor but not too salty.

In the end with the sommelier's wine pairing recommendations, I paid a total of 55 EUR, which is very affordable for a Michelin-rated restaurant. Most of the dishes can be ordered in half portions, which is a thoughtful design that allows each diner to try more dishes."
ChIJd-4jqGUoQg0Ri7UCUr8KiaA,5,Great bib gourmand restaurant in Salamanca. We especially liked the pigeon gyozo serving and the rabbit main. The blue cheese cheesecake was a fish and interesting dessert. The cava we got at treze was the best we have gotten anywhere.
ChIJeYNEtrwoQg0RINZy4LgryKA,5,"We were lucky to get at table at 13:30 on a Friday. But the place got pretty full so I think it‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs better to book a table beforehand.
The croquetas we order were for sure homemade. Very tasty and delicious. The burgers were also very good and juicy. Good size with homemade fries.
No complaints for this place, even the music was good and toilets were clean. Would love to come back here."
ChIJeYNEtrwoQg0RINZy4LgryKA,4,"Great burgers - had the Phili cheese burger with bacon and a side of croquetas (half a order is 6 to keep in mind). Attentive staff, highly recommend!"
ChIJeYNEtrwoQg0RINZy4LgryKA,4,The staff is extremely accommodating to all kinds of food alergies. Price to quality ratio is a bit high but it is worth a try.
ChIJeYNEtrwoQg0RINZy4LgryKA,5,"I love Spanish gastronomy, but if you want a break, both in music and food, this is your place.  This is by far the best burger I had in Spain.  Mushrooms with egg on top,   fenomenal!"
ChIJeYNEtrwoQg0RINZy4LgryKA,5,"Gobu is the best burger place in Madrid, no doubt about that. They have amazing off the menu options. The restaurant is very cozy. Definitely it's one of the best hidden gems in barrio Salamanca"
ChIJ001HFqQoQg0R2FKzE8zHRvY,5,"Extremely delicious! We were a group of 6 people and ordered a lot to share, all left happy and full. Decent prices, wonderful service, definitely recommend to visit this gem."
ChIJ001HFqQoQg0R2FKzE8zHRvY,5,"The food was quite delicious and relatively reasonably priced. I had a feeling I am eating fresh and authentic Spanish food with a small twist.
I‚Äôve had Rioja which I‚Äôd recommend. The staff were nice and effective and the atmosphere was lovely (although I personally prefer a bit less light).
We tried 2 dessert which was also quite nice (the cheesecake which wasn‚Äôt too sweet and I do not recall the second one)."
ChIJ001HFqQoQg0R2FKzE8zHRvY,5,"I celebrate my birthday here for 2 years now, thank you for the fantastic work. It‚Äôs in fact my favorite restaurant in Madrid.

And you should called yourself Best cheesecake in Madrid too."
ChIJ001HFqQoQg0R2FKzE8zHRvY,4,"Great restaurant that I would recommend to everyone.
Best cuisine, Good service, Good atmosphere!"
ChIJ001HFqQoQg0R2FKzE8zHRvY,5,"Amazing food! very very tasty and not expensive at all.
We had rabas, se√±orito rice, huevos rotos, and croquetas. Enough for 4 people.
And we also had cheesecake for dessert, delicious ü§©
Our waiter was super nice and kind too.
In you around the area, I highly recommend this place"
ChIJaR7r96MoQg0RbluPlg4NSYQ,5,"Absolutely fantastic experience at Taberna Laredo! The food was delicious‚Äîfresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Every dish we tried was top-notch and reflected true local taste.

The service was exceptional. We had a small accident and accidentally dropped a bottle of wine. Even though it was clearly our mistake, the team handled it with such kindness and professionalism‚Äîthey replaced the bottle free of charge, which we truly appreciated.

A special thanks to Miguel, who went above and beyond to help us choose the perfect local wine and food. His recommendations were spot-on and really elevated our experience.

The atmosphere was warm and vibrant‚Äîan unforgettable evening overall. Highly recommended for both the quality of food and the outstanding hospitality!"
ChIJaR7r96MoQg0RbluPlg4NSYQ,4,"Went on a recommendation. Our starter, anchovy with tomato and burrata, was just OK - missing some taste. The tortilla with artichoke and the steak tartar were nice, and the rabbit ribs were excellent.

The service seemed a bit challenged. They were responsive when we flagged them, but not attentive and missing some basic skills, especially for a higher-end restaurant, such as refilling our wine/water, taking away the menus after we ordered, etc. My wife (who speaks fluent Spanish) asked a waitress about a menu item; the waitress couldn‚Äôt describe it, nor offered to find out what it is. Further, we each ordered a main plate (not shared), and they brought out one at a time (intentionally; weren‚Äôt planning on firing the 2nd one until the first was served). When we pointed out they were individual plates, there was complete confusion and we decided to let it be). Hopefully, this was just an unusual night and not the norm.

I would return, but probably just stick with the bar (if I can find room - very popular)."
ChIJaR7r96MoQg0RbluPlg4NSYQ,5,"The restaurant has two separate sections, right after the entrance there is a bar area with high tables, and there is a seating space after the stairs. The upper side was quieter since the lower floor was full when I got there.
I ordered croquettes (half portion, 4 pieces), entrecote and a cheesecake (called tarta de queso in Spanish).
I was offered an amuse bouche type of a starter consisting of mortadella with pesto.
The croquettes were delicious, outside was crispy but not crunchy, stuffing was well seasoned and creamy. Although they were deep fried, they were not greasy. Good technique.
Steak was also delicious, the only downside would be the fat distribution, the fat in my cut could have been more evenly distributed. But still prime cut and good cooking. I picked salad as a side and loved it since it was very well prepared, seasoned and mixed. Simple but delicious.
The last dish was the cheesecake. Again very delicious and very well balanced. Their touch was to create a crunchy sugar layer on top like a cr√®me brul√©. It wasn't runny like a San Sebastian cheesecake.
Overall it was a pleasant experience."
ChIJaR7r96MoQg0RbluPlg4NSYQ,3,"Frankly it was mid. Cute meal and good effort but just mid.

Nori tempura scallops - felt that the scalloped weren‚Äôt aburied enough. Overall liked this, but middle of the scallop got quite plain.

Rabbit ribs, nicely spiced but too salty. Spice also got a little stale after a while, would be better if it was more oily. For rabbit eaters who are familiar with Asian rabbit dishes, this came across as really gamey. The spices didn‚Äôt really cover the stench of the meat as well as the spices I‚Äôm used to. Still a reasonable dish tho.

Artichoke omelette was disappointing. Was not salted enough and the artichoke was so dry we couldn‚Äôt taste that delish artichoke flavour sadly!"
ChIJaR7r96MoQg0RbluPlg4NSYQ,5,"Very atmospheric place, a lot of people are sitting there with the tapas and glass of vine or beer (excellent one). The dinner is started at 8pm. Very fresh products and good tastes. Some dishes was a little bit oily, but in general everything was good. Definitely should go there if you would like to explore Spanish cuisine."
ChIJxwh3iqMoQg0RulSwkxukTas,5,"We took the classic tasting menu for ‚Ç¨48 and it was wonderful. Portions were generous and every dish was delicious. We loved the battered prawns and tuna dishes.
Staff are friendly and can speak English and have printed menus in English."
ChIJxwh3iqMoQg0RulSwkxukTas,5,"Had the Tasting menu and found it to be an incredible value given the generous food portions and quality of dishes served.  The 9 course meal started off with an amuse plate of lightly fried shrimps, followed by shaved tuna with wasabi, fried battered red prawns, half grilled prawns, tuna belly with black garlic a√Øoli, Corvina with mushrooms tomato confit (full portion sized fish), puff pastry with partridge, and dessert consisting of a french toast brioche, passion fruit ice cream chocolate fritters.   Wines were also reasonably priced as we had a lovely bottle of Unzu rose.  Service was attentive and friendly.  My only complaint is that the initial five dishes came out a bit too fast, as we barely finished the earlier dish and was still discussing it before the next dish arrived."
ChIJxwh3iqMoQg0RulSwkxukTas,5,"Hardcore Spanish menu, full of seafood and fish options. Definitely have to reserve, if you are visiting would recommend you take a look at the menus before to understand the different dishes. Have salon and barra, always full especially on weekends. If you want to eat like a local, come here and they will treat you great. Great prices, around 50 euros a person with full range of food and drinks for a great feast. Would go back for sure"
ChIJxwh3iqMoQg0RulSwkxukTas,5,"We came here based on a recommendation from a local and it didn't disappoint. Everything from start to finish was delicious.
They bring out some tiny fried shrimp when you sit down as a snack. We had a lovely bottle of alborinho for 20 euro. My husband had mushroom risotto as a starter which was huge and I had grilled baby squid (a special that day) which was superb. My husband had the monkfish and rice which was actually a huge tail on the bone with some rice and I had the venison sirloin which was melt in the mouth perfect. We were too full for dessert unfortunately. Highly recommend."
ChIJxwh3iqMoQg0RulSwkxukTas,5,"Don't let the spartan, slightly outdated look of this restaurant deceive you, it is a hidden gem! Awesome product, traditional Spanish cuisine with a twist. Fairer prices than many other pretentious high end outfits. It's wine list might benefit from greater depth, yet the selection is great and very reasonably priced. Highly recommended!"
ChIJI85qKqMoQg0RmYYajgmjjxw,4,"They have so many options, it was hard to choose. But we ordered a good selection i believe. For entries, fried dumplings and chicken sticks. Soups were nice too.

Prawn red curry (gambas con curry rojo)
Chicken green curry (pollo con curry verde)
And noodles with eggs.
For the saucy gambas and chicken we ordered rice too.

For dessert we had fried icecream and mango served with milky rice.

My favourite was chicken with the green curry sauce. I really liked the sauce on each plate üëåüèº

For 4 of us, we ordered 3 entries, 3 plates and 3 deserts with 4 beers, we paid 30.15 euros per person.

Nice ambiance and friendly staff. On sunday around 2pm we were able to get a place but probably because it was raining. Better to reserve before.

I saw on the menu duck with pineapple and beef with good sauce options so I‚Äôll definitely come back to try more dishes!"
ChIJI85qKqMoQg0RmYYajgmjjxw,5,"The website describes that the restaurant wants you to have a 5 senses experience and they fulfill that mission. The restaurant is nicely decorated, the service extremely pleasant and welcoming, the music and aromas delightful, and the food absolutely amazing from the complimentary prawn crackers to the delectable clear chicken soup, to the spring rolls with a bouquet of flavors, and the mouth watering main dishes (we had chicken Thai basil, scallops with vegetables and oyster sauce, fish with tamarind sauce). We loved it so much we ate here twice in two days! Definitely recommend!!"
ChIJI85qKqMoQg0RmYYajgmjjxw,5,"Nice original Thai taste and chef very kind
Recommend"
ChIJI85qKqMoQg0RmYYajgmjjxw,5,My husband and I visited Madrid and had the opportunity to eat here. It was like going back to Thailand. Chef Nong May's cooking is very good and delicious. I highly recommend it. üëç
ChIJI85qKqMoQg0RmYYajgmjjxw,5,"We went there with a group of 3 people.
The food was very delicious. We ordered the Nua kapraw and moo priew wan. Both dishes very good and delicious. The Nua kapraw came with very little spiciness (I assume because we don‚Äôt look Asian and the waiter doesn‚Äôt want us to not being able to eat the dish), but after the I asked for more spice they gave me something to put on it was perfect. They also provide a really good amount of meat in the dishes (I think that should be clear for the prices, which are not cheap, I think they are fair for fresh quality food). We also tried the Tom Yam soup wich was cooked excellent and we all liked it. Just not as spicy as normal, like this you could taste all the different ingredients very well.

The atmosphere in the store was really nice and cozy. You could sit there really well and everything including the bathroom was clean. The woman in the store treated us very nice.

Just as a little note: Rice is not included in most dishes. If you sit in the restaurant this is not a big problem as you can just ask for rice, but if you are ordering for delivery or takeaway I would be a little bit annoyed. Maybe you can add a hint in the card, ask the people when they place the order or just include it in the dishes. It‚Äôs not a thing I still highly recommend going there and try out their delicious Thai food."
ChIJU1B9iaMoQg0RrNrItfI7eu8,5,"We ordered the Lobster Paella for 2. It was delicious and had lots of fish, shrimp and clams in it. üòã we stopped here while walking through a quiet street and heard the electric vibe coming from inside. Packed with locals eating and drinking. Great place to stop and enjoy."
ChIJU1B9iaMoQg0RrNrItfI7eu8,5,"Great little bar, cosy vibes and nice atmosphere. Prices are good"
ChIJU1B9iaMoQg0RrNrItfI7eu8,3,"Average place in Zona Ibiza. Although the price and beers are fine, as well as the bartenders, the croquettes (fish) I had were not the best. So for a beer is okay to stop by. Kitchen closes at 4 so be aware of this before going"
ChIJU1B9iaMoQg0RrNrItfI7eu8,5,"Not only nicely presented local gastronomy dishes, very tasty under a very good service!"
ChIJU1B9iaMoQg0RrNrItfI7eu8,5,"Amazing food here and good vibes, a local favourite and the paella on a Sunday is special! Also the croquettes and anchovies are superb!!!"
ChIJefk7qKMoQg0RkZCqQGBxYag,5,"Amazing food, tasty and delicious. Great service, super sashimi, beef, and deserts"
ChIJefk7qKMoQg0RkZCqQGBxYag,5,"This place never disappoints. The food is so fresh & delicious, & I love that they have a separate vegan menu."
ChIJefk7qKMoQg0RkZCqQGBxYag,5,"Delicious food and very friendly and helpful staff. I ate from the vegan menu and everything was delicious. A whole vegan menu, including desserts. Vegan sushi very well made. Not just cucumber and avocado. But marinated mushrooms and veggies with soooo much flavour!"
ChIJefk7qKMoQg0RkZCqQGBxYag,4,"Food is good and sufficient and filling, and fairly priced. Service was great. The store is clean and Asian looking.

(The following comment is nothing particularly directed towards this restaurant) Japanese food in Madrid is either really expensive (though tasty) or underwhelming. Spanish folks are indeed fond of Japanese food, however it is a bit overcharged. Most of the Asian restaurants here are run by Chinese who serve all different kinds of Asian food (a mix of East Asian and southeast Asian) all written on one menu. I do find it fun to have everything that tastes good on one menu, but it is a bit confusing for me to see everything."
ChIJefk7qKMoQg0RkZCqQGBxYag,5,"I am in love with this restaurant! The quality of their sushi is exquisite. Their service is impeccable, I think I have found my favourite Japanese restaurant in Madrid"
ChIJUyQBjKQoQg0RX5qhsF3GgOg,5,"Fantastic Chinese food in Madrid! The staff is very welcoming and bring you a tasting of an eggroll as soon as you sit down. We ordered the spicy dumplings to start and they were some of the best I‚Äôve had! Perfect amount of spice without being too overpowering. We got the Korean fried chicken, black pepper steak, bamboo fried rice, and the veggie lo mein. Our favorite dishes were the Korean fried chicken and the veggie Lo Mein. The Korean fried chicken had the perfect amount of spice, and paired well with the noodles and rice we ordered on the side. The waitress brought us complimentary macaroons at the end of the meal which were delicious as well. Overall great food, nice portions, and friendly staff."
ChIJUyQBjKQoQg0RX5qhsF3GgOg,5,"Amazing food at a very reasonable price with fantastic service! We ate as four adults; three starters and four mains. The solomillo beef was by far the best beef I‚Äôve had in a Chinese, and the duck in chilli was sublime. I would also recommend the lemon chicken and the sea bass. Their house Ribera del Duero was nice too."
ChIJUyQBjKQoQg0RX5qhsF3GgOg,4,"The men√∫ del dia is definitely worth it! The place is very crowded though and the waiters want to take something away from your table every five minutes. Honestly, I felt rushed to eat even though I had plenty of time left in my reservation."
ChIJUyQBjKQoQg0RX5qhsF3GgOg,5,"First of all, as you walk in it gives you a good vibe, how it is decorated.. etc. the staff there are very professional and are always at your services. The bathroom was very clean. You do need to make a reservation, though. The food was spectacular. There was so many different food options to choose from. I would definitely come back here, and I recommend it, especially the maki with chicken, and cheese and the lemon chicken for kids."
ChIJUyQBjKQoQg0RX5qhsF3GgOg,4,"Great experience at Kzen! We arrived very late (11:30 PM), and they were still open, which saved us. Delicious food, well-prepared, and full of flavor. Attentive and fast service, and the prices are fair for the quality. Highly recommended, especially if you need a late-night dinner!"
ChIJIaM-yx4mQg0RJNdZGUJoTLM,5,"Foods are delicious ~ the most beautiful is the natural scenes and light atmosphere. Ham and seafood are perfect,  lemonade is lovely,  sangria taste pretty nice.  We even visited twice in two days."
ChIJIaM-yx4mQg0RJNdZGUJoTLM,4,"The food is good, but a bit pricey. The place is worth its location and the terraces. I had lunch, but I think it's more of enjoying a drink place."
ChIJIaM-yx4mQg0RJNdZGUJoTLM,4,"The club looks good, the terrace upstairs is very nice and the crowd quite international.
The staff can be a bit rude sometimes and you wait quite a long time before your drink but it‚Äôs not a big deal.
The show is interesting, dancers, lights shows, sax players. Not really my cup of tea but people around me seemed to enjoy it."
ChIJIaM-yx4mQg0RJNdZGUJoTLM,4,"This is a great pitstop by the park to enjoy the view and eat great food. The food was great, i would recommend the veal truffle and roasted bell peppers. Overall the staff/service was perfect, the food was above expectations and the pricing was a bit steep but reasonable because portions were large. Worth the price of admission"
ChIJIaM-yx4mQg0RJNdZGUJoTLM,2,"The place is nice and the staff very friendly when arriving. But when the performance starts and the diner is being served, it's become obvious that waiters are not sufficient enough. The performance itself is not at all what one could expect and the food. It is sad to see a beautiful venue and a beautiful show ruined by a poor management."
ChIJ_x-SXrsoQg0Rsdx7MvexZ2k,4,"Amazing experience well placed pastries we had the Palmera de chocolate and the a Danish. We have been here several times and sat down outside the use to have servers outside but the day we
were there no one would walk outside. Near the major shopping are they have decaf and even soy or almond milk. The main pastries are Ensaimadas and I must admit they are truly amazing a true winner.
They have takeaway and most clients take things home, difficult to park but well worth it."
ChIJ_x-SXrsoQg0Rsdx7MvexZ2k,5,"I had one of their award-winning torrijas, they're absolutely delicious ü§§"
ChIJ_x-SXrsoQg0Rsdx7MvexZ2k,5,"If you like to be standing up while eating like me, this is the place, zumo de naranja Fresca is great, Tortel de mazap√°n‚Äôs sweetness is very subtle, it‚Äôs delicious"
ChIJ_x-SXrsoQg0Rsdx7MvexZ2k,5,Prices are very good as well as the quality. I especially liked the salty options (empanada Argentina?).
ChIJ_x-SXrsoQg0Rsdx7MvexZ2k,5,Amazing selection of pastries and typical desserts. Friendly staff and brilliant atmosphere. Would recommend if you are in the area!
ChIJAeBDbKQoQg0RPrHaA80b-X8,5,"It‚Äôs so good I stopped by TWICE. The vibes were immaculate and got boosted to 11 on weekend nights, with the quintessential Spanish bar crowd. Food was some of the best I‚Äôve had in Madrid, from fresh, well seasoned seafood to rich, rich steak. The drinks were great too! They were pretty tourist friendly as they had an English menu, and the service staff were fantastic. Definitely a place I‚Äôll stop by every time I‚Äôm in Madrid."
ChIJAeBDbKQoQg0RPrHaA80b-X8,5,"Best Restaurant we've been to in Madrid.

We went here at Lunch, it was quite full. We thought that the space was too tiny for a lot of people. But lo and behold, there's more space in the back!

I highly recommend going here during your trip. This was an unforgettable place!"
ChIJAeBDbKQoQg0RPrHaA80b-X8,5,"Perfect tapas place. The quality of food is superb, but even better was the service of their staff: accomodating and helpful.
Make a reservation as it gets packed.
We had vermouth, some tapas, it was delicious.
The tables are all high tables which means tall stools as seats.
Personally I find them very uncomfortable, but that is just a personal note.
Would definitely go back, the quality of the food is superb."
ChIJAeBDbKQoQg0RPrHaA80b-X8,5,"This was a very lively tapas bar with delicious food and wonderful service. We managed to grab the last remaining table inside as we'd originally booked a table outside but was raining and couldn't sit outside. Shout-out to the two waiters who were working on the evening of 12/3 as they were so kind and patient with us, and took the time to explain the menu, check in on us and have a friendly chat. They took my husband's allergy very seriously and made sure that dishes we ordered didn't contain anything that he might be allergic to, which we really appreciated about. The food was excellent, particularly the rice with octopus. They do serve a generous portion so come hungry! Overall lovely experience."
ChIJAeBDbKQoQg0RPrHaA80b-X8,5,"Spectacular. Creamy rice with octopus, sardine bread, tuna and pepper salad. My goodness were these good. Had ~10 meals in Madrid and this is the only one on the list so far we‚Äôll revisit next time we‚Äôre here!! A few items I wanted to try were sold out by the time we came to eat at 330pm, so come earlier if you can!"
ChIJC9bgKpooQg0R93sg7M-Phqc,4,"Really nice place. If you‚Äôre looking for a light snack or meal this is the place. The curry chicken sandwich was really taste. Staff is friendly. You order and pay online which is convenient, however, cellular reception is mot the best so sometimes the process is a bit annoying."
ChIJC9bgKpooQg0R93sg7M-Phqc,5,Magasand is where it's at for that feel-good food. I tried the focaccia de vitelo tonatto and it was splendid. Definitely coming back.
ChIJC9bgKpooQg0R93sg7M-Phqc,5,"This restaurant is a sandwich paradise! With a diverse bread selection, including regular, focaccia, and gluten-free options, there's something for everyone. The little Benedict egg for breakfast is a delightful treat, perfectly poached and rich. And don't even get me started on the coffee - it's a java lover's dream. Whether you're craving classics or exploring gluten-free fare, this place offers a wide array of mouthwatering choices. It's a must-visit for sandwich aficionados and breakfast lovers alike."
ChIJC9bgKpooQg0R93sg7M-Phqc,4,"We had a good lunch here.  The portions are small but delicious.  Within our group, we tried a variety of juices, sandwiches, and salads, all of which were tasty.  It wasn't the best food I had while visiting Madrid, but it was good and I would visit again if I were in the neighborhood."
ChIJC9bgKpooQg0R93sg7M-Phqc,4,"Really delicious food, friendly staff and lovely location. Magasand is definitely one of the best places to go for lunch in Madrid. My personal recommendation is the Focaccia Tonata. Portion sizes are a bit small, so I would recommend you order two dishes if you're very hungry."
ChIJO_Jx3JcoQg0R5GawDJsdPEI,5,"The best cecina in my life
I am still dreaming about the cecina sandwich
Muslim friendly"
ChIJO_Jx3JcoQg0R5GawDJsdPEI,5,"VIANDAS‚Äô HORNAZO de SALAMANCA is quite heavy , there‚Äôs seating right outside"
ChIJO_Jx3JcoQg0R5GawDJsdPEI,1,They makes you pay 10 euros for a not fresh sandwich. When i asked if it was possible to have one made at the moment they almost laughed about my question.
ChIJO_Jx3JcoQg0R5GawDJsdPEI,5,"Very good jamon iberico. There are two floors. On the first you can pick up things to go, like chorizo and bread baskets. On the 2nd there are tables set up for jamon products served by the bartender. The popular dish is the jamon sandwiches. The area, ""Sol"" is touristy and is full of bad places to eat, but this is not one of them. You can have a good meal with locals there. The house red wine is very good."
ChIJO_Jx3JcoQg0R5GawDJsdPEI,5,"Want a bocadillo de jamon? You must try it here! You can also get a drink with it, and you'll have to eat while having a nice walk looking at the Goya shops"
ChIJYZeCFb0oQg0RAUNCxZNQcCM,4,Gambas were amazing. Peppers were good.  Octopus was ok. Highly recommended for quick tapas.
ChIJYZeCFb0oQg0RAUNCxZNQcCM,4,"We went to a few of their locations as we loved the garlic shrimp, but this was our least favorite. As you can see the food doesn‚Äôt look the same in the photos as the other locations."
ChIJYZeCFb0oQg0RAUNCxZNQcCM,3,"The venue has a lot of charm and character, it is authentic. Went three times, had two different waiters and they were both unpleasant, in a rush, they did not put the plates they threw them. Some of the tapas were ok but some as the calamari had a really weird taste."
ChIJYZeCFb0oQg0RAUNCxZNQcCM,4,"The food is tasty, the location very good, it is a typically spanish restaurant. But it is touristy and pricey."
ChIJYZeCFb0oQg0RAUNCxZNQcCM,4,"I like this place, it offers a pretty authentic old Spanish taverna feel, the food is 100% Spanish, their paellas (rice dishes or ‚Äúarroces‚Äù) are very good, their ‚Äúgambas al ajillo‚Äù are also good, their own house wine is very good and their prices are very reasonable."
ChIJuzpE5qQoQg0RggR3JdF-yRs,5,"My family and I (ages 15 to 75) stumbled upon this place last night. We had no expectations and it blew our socks off. We ordered a red wine and told them to surprise us. The one the browns delicious and very reasonably priced. Then they brought us some potatoes smothered in meat and sauce (a free and delicious tapa). We ordered 6 different things off the menu and every single one was scrumptious. You must must must try the zucchini carpaccio!! Not only did we enjoy the food and the wine, but the server and the bartender were exceptional. They were gracious with our late-arrival, patient with our poor Spanish, and didn't allow us to over-order. If we were going to be in Madrid longer, we would be regulars. Gracias to La Taberna Cosme and to anyone in Madrid looking for a great meal...GO!"
ChIJuzpE5qQoQg0RggR3JdF-yRs,5,Wow... Food is great....and try the cheese cake ..
ChIJuzpE5qQoQg0RggR3JdF-yRs,5,"The wait time for the food is a bit too long. However, the quality and taste of the food makes the waiting definitely worthwhile. Therefore, if you have time to wait and chill and are eager to taste some delicious food than this is the ideal place!! Nice service and atmosphere too!!"
ChIJuzpE5qQoQg0RggR3JdF-yRs,5,"Wonderful neighborhood pub. Within a week, the waitress knew exactly what I would order and brought me my drink without asking. And she told me what food to order, including pig's ear tacos."
ChIJuzpE5qQoQg0RggR3JdF-yRs,4,"One of the best restaurant I have been in Madrid. Excellent quality of the dishes and high attention to food presentation. Great ""Menu del dia"" for 11 Eur. It's better to book a table in advance if in a big group, otherwise it can be difficult to find place available."
ChIJpzaPr6MoQg0RkJor_EANvyk,4,"We went there for lunch by chance without a reservation and we were lucky to find a table. The restaurant has a lovely ambiance and the staff is all kind and friendly. The butter and bread they serve before your food is amazing! Russian salad was okay but we didn't like the croquetas. However, ‚Äúsalpicon se marisco‚Äù, ‚Äúsalted de arroz con trufa y setas‚Äù, and french fries were above anything we had in Madrid! About the desserts, we didn't like tarta de queso and they served the coffee long after we finished our dessert but the torrija was good."
ChIJpzaPr6MoQg0RkJor_EANvyk,5,"Location - 10
Menu - 10
Service - 10
Prices - 10 (really fair for the quality of the food)
Wine list - 10

Get there around 5pm and enjoy a walk in the Park after some tapas and wine.
The atmosphere and playlist are so inviting... we had a fantastic time in our 12h layover.
Special thanks to our server from Morocco! She went out of her way to explain the dishes and select the best options for us.
Try the cold cuts, mushroom risotto and the garlic shrimps. Outstanding!
Highly recommend it!!!"
ChIJpzaPr6MoQg0RkJor_EANvyk,5,Stopped in this trendy bar for a few beers before dinner and sat at the bar. Staff kind and helpful. Very nice ambiance. Good beer and lovely olives provided. Unable to comment on food as we didn‚Äôt eat here sadly.
ChIJpzaPr6MoQg0RkJor_EANvyk,4,"Most of the dishes we ordered were good but our risotto was overly salty.  Our server recommended an incredible red wine that was well worth the ‚Ç¨10 per glass price tag. They play loud music later at night with a lot of people drinking in the bar area so it has a fun, energetic vibe."
ChIJpzaPr6MoQg0RkJor_EANvyk,5,The food was excellent. I loved the bucket of fresh butter with warm artisan bread. The burrata salad was an inspiration. So delicate but delicious. The mussels were in a surprising light curry sauce that I could have eaten like soup. Absolutely delicious!
ChIJQ0Mr38coQg0R0WFL7tehfsc,5,"Absolutely fabulous restaurant! The food was delicious, not just because it was an Indian restaurant in Madrid but hands down one of the best meals we have eaten anywhere including in India.  The service was superb, the owner, Shivani, was wonderful,very attentive,  recommended some great dishes. Love, love the food, ambience and service. Can't rate it highly enough.....do go here when in Madrid, worth every penny"
ChIJQ0Mr38coQg0R0WFL7tehfsc,4,Tasty Vegetable Biryani in Madrid. Many vegetarian indian options are available.
ChIJQ0Mr38coQg0R0WFL7tehfsc,5,"This place has the best tandoori I‚Äôve ever had, hands down."
ChIJQ0Mr38coQg0R0WFL7tehfsc,3,"I have been coming about once every year and this time was the worst. Pre cooked lamb that is heated up. Saffron rise was tasteless. Cheese nan bread not authentic.
The chicken from the bbq was watery
A lot for improvement unfortunately ‚Ä¶"
ChIJQ0Mr38coQg0R0WFL7tehfsc,4,"I would have really, really liked to give this place a perfect 5 but a couple of things - primarily related to the staff and the service bother me.

The food - excellent. Truly different and refreshing. The kerala lemon rice was a welcome change. The baingan (eggplant) was also a different preparation from the default baingan bartha. Finally, the chole was not the usual tomato rich sauce, and very tasty. The mishti-doi was lovely (but why they put raspberry sauce on it, i know not). The gulab jamun that came with it was a tad dry. On the whole, a clear winner.

Location is convenient and easy to find. The place has a welcoming atmosphere.

Service - here's where I have problems. The lady who helped us, outstanding. Friendly, knowledgeable and great to deal with. There were three guys who were not so much. Two of them were sniffing continuously and that madee nervous. One was wiping his nose and handling plates and water bottles. Not great. And then half way through the meal (we were the only people there at 8pm) the three of them stood right next to our table and proceeded to have a loud conversation amongst themselves. They weren't helping us, there was no one else in the place, and we were all the way in the back and on an elevated platform - did they have to have their conclave there? Some training would be well worth it.

Oh, and I am not sure why earlier in our meal te same three were busily taping up the air vents on the roof. Like, sheet of paper on the vents, why?

A bad twist on a highly recommended and otherwise great restaurant. Do something about it please."
ChIJx734kbsoQg0RwbIIdoJ9HX8,4,"Very solid japanese sushi. Not cheap, not expensive. Good solid option for japanese style sushi - no wild ingredients or sauces, just good sushi."
ChIJx734kbsoQg0RwbIIdoJ9HX8,5,"Very friendly staff great food, fun atmosphere. They have a grill at the table if you‚Äôre interested in that overall wonderful experience."
ChIJx734kbsoQg0RwbIIdoJ9HX8,4,Good food for a reasonable price. The staff is outstandingly friendly and the waitress gave us great suggestions. I would definitely come back here.
ChIJx734kbsoQg0RwbIIdoJ9HX8,5,"We had BBQ at the table , which was fun and nice. They have good beef. The mixed  vegetables were somewhat small for the price. Overall, it was a good experience!"
ChIJx734kbsoQg0RwbIIdoJ9HX8,5,"Very friendly staff and great food.
The waiters were very attentive and nice.
Highly recommended."
ChIJ4zkECaQoQg0RI62gfKuN-n8,5,One of my favorite places in Madrid. The carrillera de cerdo and Cecina de Leon are delicious. Great wine selection. The service is top-notch‚Äîspecial thanks to Jes√∫s for making our experience unforgettable.
ChIJ4zkECaQoQg0RI62gfKuN-n8,5,"Short menu with excellent food quality. Very good service. Higher prices than other places, but worth it. Recomended"
ChIJ4zkECaQoQg0RI62gfKuN-n8,5,"Absolutely delightful small tapas bar near Retiro park. Delicious small portions to share, try for instance ensalada rusa, oxtail tacos or meatballs. The wine list is excellent with very good quality price ratio. Most importantly this family run place has a fantastic personnel and atmosphere."
ChIJ4zkECaQoQg0RI62gfKuN-n8,5,"Tiny place with best cevich√© in Madrid. All cooked in house, no microwaved packet food! Very good wine list too! A real find in an area already packed with good places"
ChIJ4zkECaQoQg0RI62gfKuN-n8,5,"Wonderful selection of unique tapas, lovingly prepared.  Service made us feel very welcome and a little special.  A great place to spend an evening with close friends."
ChIJfe7xUqUoQg0Rx0Gr-2BZp2I,1,"Very bad experience. They brought us a raw burger and when we asked to change it, they denied. Our friend bite the burger around to find any part of the burger that was cooked but nothing. We tried to explain this to the personnel and requested another burger but none of the personnel could speak English, which is totally unacceptable for a place located outside Santiago Bernabeu. We asked many times if someone speaks English but nobody could say a single word.

We attach also a photo of the burger that they denied to change."
ChIJfe7xUqUoQg0Rx0Gr-2BZp2I,5,Really nice vibe and friendly service. Would definitely come back here.
ChIJfe7xUqUoQg0Rx0Gr-2BZp2I,3,It's a nice place for eating hot dogs and German beer. I recommend to order the four sausages to share. The hamburgers are fine but nothing special. A little overpriced but the location is very good.
ChIJfe7xUqUoQg0Rx0Gr-2BZp2I,5,Amazing atmosphere. Frank and Furt drink are great!
ChIJfe7xUqUoQg0Rx0Gr-2BZp2I,5,Great place to drink a beer and watch a football game
ChIJQ9wzqbooQg0Rk-v7wUur2vs,5,"We visited el Barril de Goya for a mid day tapas. Our experience was good and the food right on point, the place got really full around 3pm. I recommend it if you want good seafood and some drinks"
ChIJQ9wzqbooQg0Rk-v7wUur2vs,4,"Everything we were served was incredible, but the two waiters have poor customer service skills. When the wine was delivered, it was not presented but opened and put in the bucket and was not served. Were we supposed to pour our own wine? Food was great, but the waiters were not gracious or helpful."
ChIJQ9wzqbooQg0Rk-v7wUur2vs,5,"The lobster paella was a showcase,  as well as the shrimp cocktail.  We weren't expecting food there to be this amazing,  since it was a random choice by pure chance.  What a refreshing,  delicious pleasant surprise Madrid.  You don't cease to impress!"
ChIJQ9wzqbooQg0Rk-v7wUur2vs,5,"A lovely, top quality seafood restaurant with very good service ! But be careful with the delicious desserts : they are huge !!"
ChIJQ9wzqbooQg0Rk-v7wUur2vs,4,The food was very good but service was a little rushed. The rice came while we were eating the starters so we sent it away and we had it though it was excellent but it spoiled the meal a little.
ChIJqXwTr7ooQg0RPyGQCEufUik,5,"Excellent seafood restaurant in the heart of the Goya area of Salamanca, in Madrid. Everything is beyond fresh, top quality, the atmosphere is great and the service is also excellent. I highly recommend it if you are in the mood for some delicious seafood. It is pricey but totally worth it!!"
ChIJqXwTr7ooQg0RPyGQCEufUik,5,"Is this place awesome?, yes!!!! Actually, the next thing above. Is that good. If you are visiting Madrid and want a dinning experience above and beyond all you have known in your life, you must come to this place. The food is wonderful, so much so that this place is in the famous Michelin guide for 2024. The attention is superb and the ambient awesome. This is the place to visit wether you are a tourist looking for the best of Madrid or a local in search of a great place to conduct business or bring your loved ones. This place is to remember."
ChIJqXwTr7ooQg0RPyGQCEufUik,3,Great restaurant if you are a party of 6 or more.
ChIJqXwTr7ooQg0RPyGQCEufUik,5,Great food served in a great atmosphere (ate inside) excellent service and decent pricing for the product you get. I believe it is a chain of restaurants but it does feel like it is a unique and this in particular is large and elegant as if it only was the only one in Madrid. I would come back once a week to eat here if I lived in Madrid. They have a good selection of wines by the glass and food specially sea food (as they also have land dishes) is very fresh. Do not hesitate to try it.
ChIJqXwTr7ooQg0RPyGQCEufUik,5,Excellent seafood & service in a beautiful setting. I had some braised octopus and then grilled monkfish. Flan for dessert with pear ice cream. All were outstanding. Very attentive wait staff. Recommend.
ChIJG2o4jJUoQg0RUPGU81e6-sM,1,"I was so disappointed.  I came to enjoy a Sunday coffee and brought my small poodle- something that I have been doing for several years.  About halfway through my coffee, I was told to leave as dogs were not allowed inside.  I have never been told this at any other time.  No where there is a sign or a sticker (as other establishments use) anywhere on the building or on the door and the barista asked me after I had paid for my breakfast and already was in the process of eating it.  He could  have said something when I paid or was ordering.  Poor way of handling things."
ChIJG2o4jJUoQg0RUPGU81e6-sM,2,The entrance to the store has some sharp pointy edges over which you can trip. Stir spoons are not kept where the sugar and napkins are kept but instead are located on their counter. When asked for a spoon they did not hand it but just pointed to a place behind their counter. Service could be better. The knobs on both the door and the flusher on the men‚Äôs restroom were missing. Coffee was okay.
ChIJG2o4jJUoQg0RUPGU81e6-sM,5,"The staff was very friendly and helpful, when the card didn't work when i tried to pay they offered the drink for free, in my entire time in spain i have never seen a staff like that, thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJG2o4jJUoQg0RUPGU81e6-sM,5,"Nice place, great vibes , friendly staff and beautiful energy.."
ChIJG2o4jJUoQg0RUPGU81e6-sM,2,Very slow waited for 20 minutes for a coffee.
ChIJF1TkW5ooQg0RyPgnkniUgVs,5,"Fantastic meat restaurant on Calle de Recoletos
Lovely wooden interior. Very nice smiling waiters.
Eggs with potatoes were very tasty.
The Picana was well cooked.
The beef tartar was cold and nicely spicy (Mustard).
Fantastic tomato salad
Huge portions.
Booking required IMO
One of our best meals in Madrid

Highly recommended"
ChIJF1TkW5ooQg0RyPgnkniUgVs,5,"The food was incredible. Every dish had an unforgettable experience, especially the Wagyu beef. The restaurant is always full, so it is better to make a reservation before."
ChIJF1TkW5ooQg0RyPgnkniUgVs,5,"BEST GRILLED MEAT ü•©
üìç Recoletos, Madrid
‚≠êÔ∏è 4/5
üí∏ ¬£¬£¬£
üç¥I stumbled upon @vacayhuerta during my recent Madrid escapade and boy, was it a meat lover's paradise! üòç This hidden gem serves up some seriously succulent, matured meat that'll have you swooning. From the starters featuring #artichokes candied in flower with arbequina oil to crispy #tempura vegetables with a tangy soy sauce twist, each bite was a revelation. And let's not forget their divine #carpaccio of Galician blonde cow with parmesan flakes and arugula - absolute perfection!  But the real star of the show? Their low #loin of old blonde Galician cow matured for a whopping 40 days! ü•© And as if that weren't enough, the creamy baked #cheesecake for dessert was simply dreamy üåü"
ChIJF1TkW5ooQg0RyPgnkniUgVs,5,"We were a large group. Everything was excellent.
The tomato starter was surprisingly wonderful, but also the artichoke. To tell the truth, everything we ordered was very good. I shared Wagyu meat which was excellent and so so tender.
Thank you for the staff and excellent service!!"
ChIJF1TkW5ooQg0RyPgnkniUgVs,5,"Excellent restaurant! Top quality food, great atmosphere and a nice very good service. Our best gourmet experience in Madrid! Highly recommend!"
ChIJW-utY6UoQg0ReTzXfyHRr_0,5,"First time dining here although I've passed this place numerous here on business travel.  So glad my colleague and I decided to dine here.  The service and food was amazing.  We sat outside as it was a warm Tuesday night.  The avocado salad is scrumptious with fresh tomatoes, onions, feta, and avocado.  I dislike tomatoes on salads, as they tend to be too acidic.  However,  the tomatoes here were sweet  and fresh.  The salad is huge, it can serve as a meal for one or side salad for 4.  Garlic shrimp was ordered as an appetizer.  The turbot was cooked to perfection with home saut√©ed potatoes and onion.  The cheesecake has a fresh graham crust.  The value is amazing here as they give you so many added dishes.  The sea salt shrimp,  nuts, olives, bread, after dinner cookies/wafers, and coffee/cream liquor are really an added value/complimentary treat.  Although on my next visit I will pass on the bread and garlic shrimp.  I will definitely dine here again in the near future.  The price was only about 108 euros for two people. Dinner was well worth it!!"
ChIJW-utY6UoQg0ReTzXfyHRr_0,1,"Although the service was professional, I didn't enjoy the food. We started with a plate of fried mixed fish platter which I found to be extremely salty and some of the fish was too fishy for my liking.  The second starter was a tomato salad. The tomatoes were green, unriped and tasteless.
Our mains were the cod and clam plate which was served in a white creamy soup base. The fish was undercooked.  Not at all what I was expecting. 90 euros for a very disappointing meal."
ChIJW-utY6UoQg0ReTzXfyHRr_0,5,"A great local place in Madrid for drinks and tapas. Although it‚Äôs located by the Novotel Madrid Center the clientele seemed all local. Service was great (thanks, Adrian); great pour, and the best-sized/best-priced/best-tasting gambas al ajillo!"
ChIJW-utY6UoQg0ReTzXfyHRr_0,5,"Stumbled at this restaurant on our way looking for a place to have dinner.Actually it‚Äôs within the premises of the hotel where we were staying,while in Madrid. Very nice ambiance, our waiter was very courteous and helpful.Food ,very delicious. A big thank you for  the drinks and some dish courtesy of the house.A truly enjoyable and unforgettable dining experience.Will definitely come back."
ChIJW-utY6UoQg0ReTzXfyHRr_0,5,absolutely delicious !   they give out after dinner drinks and little cookies as well as almonds and olives gratis.   seafood and fish dishes cooked to perfection and service could not have been better.   very small and charming restaurant
ChIJ17ae9ZooQg0RKKPmn3LWlps,1,"Unfortunately I was really disappointed with this restaurant. The seafood did not taste fresh, the scallops were overcooked and very small/not great quality, the paella was not worth the cost, there was barely any seafood in it. And the staff were not friendly. For two people we spent around 300 euros, and sadly we will not be going back. There are lots of other really good seafood restaurants in Madrid, please try them instead."
ChIJ17ae9ZooQg0RKKPmn3LWlps,3,"We were recommended to come here for paella from some locals. The service was okay, restaurant was very quiet maybe 3 tables and the waiter that took our order never came back to serve us. Paella was okay but not sure it I would say it‚Äôs the best paella in Madrid"
ChIJ17ae9ZooQg0RKKPmn3LWlps,5,Fantastic find. Seafood Paella is outstanding. The salt encrusted sea bass is so tender it melts in your mouth. Paired with aeole sauces the chef knows what he's doing.
ChIJ17ae9ZooQg0RKKPmn3LWlps,4,Good pulpo and for dessert we had filloas (like a very this crepe with cream inside)
ChIJ17ae9ZooQg0RKKPmn3LWlps,4,"Excellent food, really good desserts, nice attention. Price pretty expensive"
ChIJPZGh9JooQg0R4g5zG6wE16I,5,amazing experience! luxurious interior in moroccan style. impeccably delicious dishes. huge thanks to the waiters for the service! excellent selection of wines! we enjoyed it 100% will definitely come again! recommend!

ChIJPZGh9JooQg0R4g5zG6wE16I,5,"This restaurant exceeded our expectations! üëå

We were captivated by the exceptional food, outstanding service, and delightful ambiance. Each dish was a masterpiece, leaving us in awe of the chef's culinary prowess.

It's no exaggeration to say that this dining experience ranks among the finest in Madrid. We were so impressed that we immediately made a reservation for the following day; we couldn't resist indulging in another unforgettable meal. üòÅ

üåü Pro tip: Ensure you secure a reservation in advance to avoid missing out on this extraordinary culinary adventure."
ChIJPZGh9JooQg0R4g5zG6wE16I,5,"Incredible, a must place to try the best Moroccan food. The service was excellent, all the staff were kind and attentive. English widely spoken which helps people such as me. QR code menu has photos if you‚Äôre unsure how things look. The decor is so beautiful, real attention to detail, so good to eat in high quality surroundings. Traditional background music. Waiters wore the nicest clothing. Tea was sweet and refreshing. Appetisers were perfect. Harira soup, wow, packed with flavours. The ambrosia lamb was the tastiest tajine I‚Äôve ever had. Portions were just right. Everything is done to the highest standard. It‚Äôs magic how they made simple white rice taste so good. Prices reflect the quality of ingredients, ambience and everything. RECOMMENDED"
ChIJPZGh9JooQg0R4g5zG6wE16I,5,If you came to madrid and you didn‚Äôt try this real Moroccan foods here in madrid you wouldn‚Äôt find it anywhere in Europe and thanks to Mr Mustapha for the highly quality customer service ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôè
ChIJ35GTQbAoQg0R0NjSukkbcys,5,"We came on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was quite packed and thus loud.

But the there was a lot to order on the card, we did not have to wait long for the food, the servers were nice and the food was great!

We will come again."
ChIJ35GTQbAoQg0R0NjSukkbcys,5,"OMGÈùûÂ∏∏Â•ΩÂêÉÔºÅfood is fresh and price is very reasonable.
It is the second time here, the spicy pot was just the best I havent taste that style for long time, since we used to have Sichuan style ÁâõÊ≤π hotpot, this one just so special (It is spicy, also with many ingredients & herbs in soup but not too much oil) and reminds me the tradition one we had in Shanghai when I was young."
ChIJ35GTQbAoQg0R0NjSukkbcys,5,"Service: really good service,attentive to the needs, gives suggestions on how to order, free fruits at the end was very considerate.
Food: we ordered hotpot, the portions were quite good, for two us us, 7 dishes of mixed veggies and meat were plenty enough. The veggies and meat were fresh.
Environment: it is a restaurant mainly for hotpot, so if you don‚Äôt want your suit to smell, better not wear them here.  Quite clean overall."
ChIJ35GTQbAoQg0R0NjSukkbcys,5,"We had a fantastic dinner. Hotpot, half spicy, half normal. You can choose 5 levels of spicy. For eurpeans 2 or 3 is enough. We ordedered many types of meats, vegetables and pastas. My favourite meat was the pork. The beef was a bit too frozen and it could be felt in the texture. For the veggies, the bamboo and the good ears are a must. As for pasta the hotpot noodles were our favourites. The service was exceptional, very fast and attentive. The price was very good, 21.3‚Ç¨ per person but we ate like in an ""All you can eat"". The tables are a bit close between them and on peak times it can get a bit noisy. But it's strongest points are the quality and the price."
ChIJ35GTQbAoQg0R0NjSukkbcys,4,"Very nice hot pot, not too spicy and is localized. Still, reasonable price for the volume and I would repeat again, although the staffs do not have any smile at all."

I had been told about this bingo, I went the other day for the first time and won money. I'll definitely come back.

By the way, very clean and good atmosphere.

Highly recommended."
ChIJRYt5fKMoQg0RwYdbPLFaiIo,4,"I'm not one to go to Bingo much. It was the first time I went to this place and the receptionist noticed this. He welcomed me, with a smile. Nice detail.

ChIJ7ad2vaIoQg0R-qhJzTn6wu4,5,Already after ordering I wanted to give 5 stars and I hadn‚Äôt even tried the food yet. The staff were exceptionally attentive and explained the menu in details. They served me food before their ‚Äúlunch hours‚Äù. And the food itself was nourishing and tasty. Adding this to my favorite list of restaurants in Madrid. Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChIJ7ad2vaIoQg0R-qhJzTn6wu4,5,"Food was really nice, clean and healthy. Friendly stuff. I would only recommend to exclude succulents from interior (including. photos) - it can be bad energy and bad luck for a place üçÄ"
ChIJ7ad2vaIoQg0R-qhJzTn6wu4,5,"The food is incredibly good. Health for real: not too much salt, not additional fats but still very tasty.

The service is great and the waiter (Diego) was putting so much love and effort in what he does. Is always nice to find this energy.

My new favourite place in Madrid to have lunch. Thank you so much, is very hard to find a good healty place."
ChIJ7ad2vaIoQg0R-qhJzTn6wu4,5,Cute cafe with good food and coffee. Wonderful owners and staff.
ChIJVflqj7AoQg0Ryqx_FX7kiUg,5,My best culinary experience so far (and I have had many) This place is a definition of an ultimate joy Couldn't recommend more
ChIJVflqj7AoQg0Ryqx_FX7kiUg,5,"This is a classic Madrid Spanish hangout. The dishes are almost traditional but better! Rabo, veggies, caldo, everything. And best of all, high quality wines at very reasonable prices. It might be too busy to enter but definitely worth a try, especially after a nearby bill fight!"
ChIJVflqj7AoQg0Ryqx_FX7kiUg,4,"The service was excellent, the owner was very friendly, food superb but overpriced, we were charged for 4 liquor chupito but only had 2, the waiter never fixed the bill."

Rabo de toro is very good.
Eggs with bogavante as well"

ChIJx89pyKUoQg0R4zT3s456HIA,5,"The food is delicious, especially the torrezno con revolconas. Cozy atmosphere. Highly recommended."
ChIJx89pyKUoQg0R4zT3s456HIA,5,Little bar. Quiet.
ChIJx89pyKUoQg0R4zT3s456HIA,5,"A place of which there are few left in the neighborhood, homemade, abundant and quality food, good atmosphere and price without the noise of children or people shouting like in other restaurants, it is worth visiting"
ChIJx89pyKUoQg0R4zT3s456HIA,3,"Torreznos of the bunch to bear his name. Terrible staff service (the one on Goya Street), with a veteran waiter behind the bar who is unpleasant and rude. There are many places in the area to have tapas where you will not feel like you are bothering you. DO NOT ENTER!! I warned"
ChIJx89pyKUoQg0R4zT3s456HIA,5,"I arrived almost at closing time and they still treated me phenomenally, they tried 10 and very good food, a recommendable visit if you are in the area."

ChIJ5TXd-a4oQg0RntdGKc_DZjs,5,"I have eaten at this place throughout the month of September because my son's school had no afternoons during that month and I had to pick him up earlier.
It has been quite a discovery because both the quality and daily variety of the daily menu and the treatment of Fernando (the person who served me during the service these days) have been magnificent.
I recommend it and taking into account that I have had my business for 10 years, eating out every day during the week, I am not satisfied with just eating anything and I really value being treated well and given quality food."
ChIJ5TXd-a4oQg0RntdGKc_DZjs,4,"Well located, good views, with terrace outside, well decorated, clean, polite and friendly staff. Homemade food and when they put eggs on the menu, they give you two (not one). With the drink they served us an appetizer while we waited. A 10. If you order a combination plate, you can choose the garnish."
ChIJ5TXd-a4oQg0RntdGKc_DZjs,4,"Very professional and attentive camero treatment. A simple breakfast consisting of warm coffee with milk along with two batons, which by dipping them in the coffee acquire the optimal temperature for consumption, in addition to its modest price"
ChIJ5TXd-a4oQg0RntdGKc_DZjs,2,"The place is not bad, but why do the waitresses insist on being so unpleasant? Maybe the owner doesn't treat them well, but I do. In the end..."
ChIJ5TXd-a4oQg0RntdGKc_DZjs,1,"We were the other day at this place that is now called ""El piruli de O'Donnel"". Discreet service, without more. We were surprised when the bill arrived. We had to pay 10.40 euros for two summer red wines, not even on Serrano Street do they charge that much. We asked the waitress for the ticket and to check if she considered 2 red wines or 4, given the excessive cost and she answered us in a bad way. We will never return"
ChIJn9bM4qUoQg0R6LW_8RXou8s,3,Typical Spanish food dine in restaurant with daily menu. Not expensive. Food average. Very low quality service. Impatient and loud waitress. But you will not  get out hungry.

ChIJn9bM4qUoQg0R6LW_8RXou8s,5,Good food and the service was great
ChIJn9bM4qUoQg0R6LW_8RXou8s,5,"Typical neighborhood restaurant, but with charm, everything was phenomenal, we ordered a menu at 15.90 with fabada and Galician-style knuckle, both delicious. They have everything on the menu, from what we saw the cachopo is the star dish, they serve it with a bottle of cider for ‚Ç¨24.00. The service is fast and efficient.
To repeat a ten"
ChIJbdyr5aUoQg0RUV1PbKj2VXA,1,"Very, very poor quality of the services. Don‚Äôt buy their products through delivery platforms, as they might accept them without having the product available for delivery which will lead practically in loosing your money."

Tell me about a wide variety of sweets, pastas, empanadas, sandwiches..."
ChIJsZd_7aUoQg0RcERqJuNVTxU,5,"The best meringue millefeuille that my mother-in-law has had for years and it reminds her of her childhood, and we have enjoyed in Tenerife the truffle crowns for the Virgin of La Almudena"
ChIJsZd_7aUoQg0RcERqJuNVTxU,4,"Fastastic neighborhood bakery with many years of experience. They have all the time of products such as cakes, palm trees, empanadas, etc... As soon as you enter, it already smells nourishing. They are very friendly and all the products look very good. The truth is that it is recommended if you want to buy this type of products in the neighborhood, for yourself or to give a gift."
ChIJq8aRGaYoQg0R6cAokExTs4E,5,"This  Peruvian chicken thats cooked on charcoal is the best I have ever eaten.
All the sauces are made in house and the homemade chips are amazing.

ChIJq8aRGaYoQg0R6cAokExTs4E,5,Best chicken in town üî•
ChIJq8aRGaYoQg0R6cAokExTs4E,5,Best chicken in Madrid.
ChIJq8aRGaYoQg0R6cAokExTs4E,5,"The best charcoal chicken in Madrid, with its combos that make the difference with other similar ones. Staff - friendly and professional in the kitchen/ I think Chicote and Argui√±ano can ask for their recipes/
All a 10 üëç"
ChIJq8aRGaYoQg0R6cAokExTs4E,5,"We have tried the charcoal chicken several times and we must say that they are spectacular, the fries are delicious, they are cut by hand (they are not frozen), they also give you a bag with three sauces. We haven't tried other products they have, but we will next time."
ChIJo2442ikmQg0RqryTMVr0-Ls,4,"An excellent culinary experience, with superbly fresh seafood, however, steeply priced.

Every dish was excellent, all the way through to outstanding desserts. However, possibly because of a very restricted space (40 seats?), the premium pricing vs similar places in Madrid runs at about 30-40%. That‚Äôs the reason why I didn‚Äôt give it a 5*."
ChIJo2442ikmQg0RqryTMVr0-Ls,4,"A place to definitely take into account  for fresh grilled fish and seafood.  Superb product, that you will have to pay for. Small,  cozzy and elegant venue, good service and well-chosen wine list."
ChIJo2442ikmQg0RqryTMVr0-Ls,5,I can't wait to dine here again when we return in February.  My wife and I had an amazing experience here.  We ordered the whole roasted rock fish and it was spectacular.  We love the decore and how unique the tableware was.  The wait staff are so friendly and helpful!
ChIJo2442ikmQg0RqryTMVr0-Ls,4,"The food was good, sea food was really fresh and they really cooked the good fish. However, the ensaladilla was very common and not amazing, and the price is really high. I think i will only go one time."
ChIJo2442ikmQg0RqryTMVr0-Ls,5,"Fresh fish, beautifully prepared. Decor is rustic and simple, showing the restaurant‚Äôs focus on food. It can be a bit pricey but the quality of the food and preparation is worth it. You get to select a whole fresh fish at your table, which is then simply prepared on a charcoal grill and served deboned, which for me makes it easier to eat and enjoy. Wine selection is also very good (I would opt for a nice Albari√±o, pairs well with the seafood)."
ChIJf0XTga8oQg0RvwwgjjzosHM,3,"Nice wholesome place for a quick bocadillo. Make sure to try their Huevos Benedict con Bacon: flavorful and freshly toasted. Just infront of Novotel, along C. de O'Donnel, üá™üá∏"
ChIJf0XTga8oQg0RvwwgjjzosHM,4,"The cafeteria is a place to work or read, a quiet place to relax and have some dessert. With palmera to eat and a bocadillo as an extra, made it all a nice experience. The staff was nice and quite fun to talk to, which made the experience even better. The food is not for everyone‚Äôs tastes but very delicious. üòÑ"
ChIJf0XTga8oQg0RvwwgjjzosHM,5,"Nice sandwiches, good coffee and outdoor seating. Good for a quick bite while on the go."
ChIJf0XTga8oQg0RvwwgjjzosHM,1,"Yuck. I used to like this place because it was quick, conveniant, tasted alright and was priced good. That is until I got two black hairs in my french fries. Disgusting. EVen though the sandwiches are prepackaged I still wont be going there a second time. Staff should be clean and the restaurant should be clean. The fact that I found a hair in my friends isnt a minor mistake to me but is a mistake that wont make me go there a second time ever again."
ChIJf0XTga8oQg0RvwwgjjzosHM,3,Service was very slow as there was only 2 worker. The sandwich I ordered was good but the rest of my table didn't like theirs.
ChIJ-Wh03a0oQg0RRJGRggO2fIE,5,"Great local pub/restaurant for regular beers and food.  But last week they had an AMAZING Michelin star-style.  It was an incredible dinner usually reserved for the best restaurants in Madrid.  I invited three friends who LOVED it as well.  Can't wait for the next ""secret menu"" @ La Estrella.

Thanks Alex!"
ChIJ-Wh03a0oQg0RRJGRggO2fIE,5,"Service was very prompt, food came out fairly quickly, Inside and outside seating. We sat outside and there was some traffic which made it a little loud at times but nothing too bad. All of the food was full of flavor, and HOT! I'd definitely come back."
ChIJ-Wh03a0oQg0RRJGRggO2fIE,2,"Decent food. Nice sized menu. Average prices. Everything was fine until we went to leave.

My girlfriend and I had each ordered water to drink. The water came in two glass bottles. We were in a rush so we didn't finish drinking it all. We paid, grabbed the bottles and headed for the door.

As we get to the door, the waiter and some woman behind the bar start to make a big deal about us taking the bottles and ""no se puede."" Of course every head is turned looking at us.

Excuse me? I just paid 3‚Ç¨ per bottle for this water. If they're that big on retaining the bottles it's because they reuse them which may indicate they're filling branded bottles with tap water. Not sure if that's legal.

If you go, don't bother with the water. After they made a scene, I don't think I'll ever go back.

RESPONSE TO OWNER: I did exaggerate when I mentioned the price. My point was that the water was not free. We paid for it. What I did not exaggerate was how rude the staff was. The waiter saw me get up from the table with the bottle and said nothing. He watched us and waited until my hand was on the door to leave to speak loudly then the woman behind the bar put her mouth in it. Everyone stopped their conversations and had their eyes on this. Do you think I come to your restaurant and pay to be humiliated? Perhaps if the staff knew how to explain things calmly and politely as you just did instead of basically yelling ""No se puede llevar las botellas!"" I would not have written this review."
ChIJ-Wh03a0oQg0RRJGRggO2fIE,5,I has a great time and the food was very good. The owner is a great host and made our evening even better
ChIJ-Wh03a0oQg0RRJGRggO2fIE,3,"Good staff, not the best food!"
ChIJQcCeIKQoQg0R0Z_8uvc02zw,4,"A 'domingo de baj√≥n' es best spent at 100 Montaditos. Very accesible prices and a great seating location on Narv√°ez definitely makes it a guilty pleasure to visit. Very self service oriented where you order and pick up your own food, but it doesn't really affect the experience. The breakfast before 12pm combined with Sunday euromania offers makes it a spot you can visit with friends and family and watch the hours go by on a lazy Sunday."
ChIJQcCeIKQoQg0R0Z_8uvc02zw,5,"You have to come here if you visit Madrid! The small sendwiches are so delicious and lovely that you will not regret spending between 1 and 2 EUR on one! Order 3, it will be enough! The sweet ones are good too!"
ChIJQcCeIKQoQg0R0Z_8uvc02zw,5,"Reasonable prices.  Wednesday and sundays they have 1‚Ç¨ bocadillos and 2‚Ç¨ beers, but then again.  Beers are always 2‚Ç¨  üòï   but very affordable compared to their neighbors."
ChIJQcCeIKQoQg0R0Z_8uvc02zw,4,I love Montaditos. This was my second time in 100 Montaditos. This was in Retiro. Near Ibiza estacion. Everything was good.
ChIJQcCeIKQoQg0R0Z_8uvc02zw,5,Service amazing and prices good. Has a screen for the football and we watched Liverpool in Madrid.  6 times European Cup Champions
ChIJq9FsXqQoQg0RnUdQHthpiC8,4,"Prices were reasonable for the value of the food. Staff was efficient - not terribly friendly. But we enjoyed our time. The wine was delicious, and they brought tapas with the drinks. Overall, we had a nice, affordable lunch. Would definitely recommend the tostas and the cuttlefish."
ChIJq9FsXqQoQg0RnUdQHthpiC8,4,"Food is very good and big portions, so prices are balanced. Service is good and fast, staff are friendly. They bring tapas with each drink which is a plus."
ChIJq9FsXqQoQg0RnUdQHthpiC8,5,"A typical Madrid bar, very local atmosphere, good service and by far the most generous tapas around. Perfect place to have some ca√±as and hangout‚Äôs with friends in the outdoor terrace. After doing a ‚Äúself-guided‚Äù tour of tapas in Goya we definitely give this bar the 1st place. We even ended up doing a major detour to come back and have our last beer in Madrid here."
ChIJq9FsXqQoQg0RnUdQHthpiC8,4,Nice out door seating

ChIJ568rUqUoQg0RVQK_weQQp-w,1,"Terrible food, and I‚Äôm English ! Have been coming to Madrid for 10 years and have never had plates this bad - nearly everything overcooked. We should have looked at the reviews before we sat down as doesn‚Äôt just seem like a bad day for the chef‚Ä¶only positive is nice location on the pedestrian plaza however the restaurants nearby can only be better"
ChIJ568rUqUoQg0RVQK_weQQp-w,4,Food was good but nothing mind-blowing. Prices were just about average for Madrid. It's an ok place of you want some good food and bucket of beers. If you're a tourist they're more authentic tapas than this one
ChIJ568rUqUoQg0RVQK_weQQp-w,3,"The kubos on itself earn a 3 star raiting, cheap alcoholic beers in a bucket of ice! But the food was kind of disappointing, the chicken fingers were the only good tapas we ate there."
ChIJ568rUqUoQg0RVQK_weQQp-w,3,Cheap buckets of beers. And some tasty snacks. Young and often loud clientele.
ChIJ568rUqUoQg0RVQK_weQQp-w,2,"Cheap, service is on par with quality and prices... Good location on the Dali square"
ChIJxd40NKUoQg0RVGog1M81GSA,5,"Love it!! Janette is the best! She
Explained the food to a T!! Love the service!! This place is going to be in business for a long time!"
ChIJxd40NKUoQg0RVGog1M81GSA,1,"We went there just because they have good prices. But the food is barely edible and the service is horrible. The waitresses don't smile, they almost throw your order in your face and they're super nice to their friends."
ChIJxd40NKUoQg0RVGog1M81GSA,5,"I really liked barmen
And beer's volume is super fair"
ChIJxd40NKUoQg0RVGog1M81GSA,1,Terrible microwaved burger with tasteless fries. Avoid at all cost.
ChIJxd40NKUoQg0RVGog1M81GSA,4,Chain Tapas place where you can get Tapas anytime
ChIJd8pSDqQoQg0R3svufSPc8-k,5,"This is a quaint and delicious little restaurant serving canarian food made to order. All the food is fresh and made in the moment. Having said that, I know what you‚Äôre thinking. No, the food is not slow to the table, and, no, I had only one glass of vino while I waited.

We enjoyed so much food here. From fried eggplant to pulpo and from a beautifully cooked steak to a savory stew, it was all so good. The best was the deliciously refreshing and reenergizing barraquito. It‚Äôs like an Irish coffee had a baby with an island drink then raised it in Spain. It was amazing!

Overall, I really liked this restaurant, its vibe and its food. The only downside is that the seating area is so small."
ChIJd8pSDqQoQg0R3svufSPc8-k,5,"Amazing place: tasty food, friendly people, who can help you with the food and wine. Definitely worth to came back!"
ChIJd8pSDqQoQg0R3svufSPc8-k,5,"I really enjoyed this unassuming little restaurant tucked away in the busy streets of the trendy Ibiza neighborhood. The eclectic variety of food on offer has a distinct Canarian touch to it, being that the chef is from the Canary Islands. Each dish is beautifully presented and will leave you licking your lips for more. Service is polite and friendly and prices are on par with the neighborhood in which it's located - not cheap."
ChIJd8pSDqQoQg0R3svufSPc8-k,5,"The pork cheeks was a bit salty for us. But the rest dishes were adorable, especially their cheese cream which we finished it without taking a picture lol"
ChIJd8pSDqQoQg0R3svufSPc8-k,5,Recommend it with all my heart. Never have I ever tasted anything so divine. we ordered meat tapas and the meat was so nicely done with smoky taste. It melted in our mouths. We had rice rings they were superb and the pork cheek was brilliant. We stuffed ourselves so much or we would‚Äôve kept ordering. Anyone visiting Madrid or living in Madrid has to visit this place. The sisters duo is awesome.
ChIJw9cA0UwvQg0Ry2pMWI5HYJE,5,It's a very atmospheric place. Service at the highest level. The food is delicious!
ChIJw9cA0UwvQg0Ry2pMWI5HYJE,5,Great traditional basque food in a lovely atmosphere and with very good sweet
ChIJw9cA0UwvQg0Ry2pMWI5HYJE,5,"One of the best places in Madrid, quality is always good. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Meat is always good and for the fair price you will get really amazing food and quality."
ChIJw9cA0UwvQg0Ry2pMWI5HYJE,5,"I have been there more than 5 times and they are consistent with the great food and great service! I highly recommend trying it out, I am sure you will enjoy."
ChIJw9cA0UwvQg0Ry2pMWI5HYJE,5,Literally the best food we've had in Spain and maybe anywhere... Very friendly service as well. Better than most (all?) Michelin star places I've been to. Just wow.
ChIJj1ZDLFAvQg0RY8XOZFRiIac,5,"Very good bar, good breakfasts, sandwiches and the best terrace in the sun!"
ChIJj1ZDLFAvQg0RY8XOZFRiIac,5,"Good place for breakfast in La Elipa. Friendly and helpful waiters. A 10.
The price is correct, neither expensive nor cheap."
ChIJj1ZDLFAvQg0RY8XOZFRiIac,5,The attention of the owners is 100/10
ChIJj1ZDLFAvQg0RY8XOZFRiIac,4,"A good bar for breakfast and an aperitif and above all, kindness on the part of the waiters. A long-standing bar in the neighborhood, I went there with my family since I was little and may it continue like this for many years."
ChIJj1ZDLFAvQg0RY8XOZFRiIac,5,"People with human quality tapas with an incredible flavor, excellent bar for portions, beers and more"
ChIJaY1QH1AvQg0Rt5-Kl4JMrqw,1,"Frozen meat, potatoes and bread. Service more than slow and to make matters worse, he goes to the service, leaves without washing his hands and continues touching the burgers with his bare hand. The secret is in the lack of hygiene. And if you think it's at least worth it for the price... You're clear."
ChIJaY1QH1AvQg0Rt5-Kl4JMrqw,5,"I've been eating at this place since I was eleven years old, the best burger üçî in the neighborhood. Attention, great neighborhood food ü§§."
ChIJaY1QH1AvQg0Rt5-Kl4JMrqw,5,"Small place a little hidden and in a humble neighborhood. Its schedule does not make it very accessible, but it is worth going.
Ideal for having a drink or eating. The owners are very nice and attentive.
Homemade, ""village"" food, which is far from that ""gourmet"" but which is also appealing.
Varied menu and very good prices.
I ordered the giant burger they have and it was tremendous. Not at all greasy, tasty, loaded and generally very tasty."
ChIJaY1QH1AvQg0Rt5-Kl4JMrqw,5,"A very delicious burger restaurant. From the neighborhood.
Good service, good food. Small place and small terrace, if you are from the neighborhood, you will surely love it.  If you are into Instagrammable fashion. Maybe you'll object hahaha"
ChIJaY1QH1AvQg0Rt5-Kl4JMrqw,5,"Very good place with delicious food in the most ""German"" style.. Delicious burgers and sausages.. Very pleasant atmosphere and excellent service.. To return many times..!!"
ChIJ3yqC8bIoQg0RJ1UlEkhANaw,5,"It's a great local spot for a drink. Service is great, it has a warm atmosphere and the aperitivos are always fulfilling (cheese, cured meats, chips served in their trademark big tuna tins). They also have a great variety of tostas. It's a must go in the area!"
ChIJ3yqC8bIoQg0RJ1UlEkhANaw,5,"For the Aussies out there, very typical spanish atmosphere on how it feels to eat local at a cheap price. Order the tapas like croquetas, paella etc, and try a few things you've never heard of! Sweet place, loving it."
ChIJ3yqC8bIoQg0RJ1UlEkhANaw,5,"We went for a quick dinner but we promised ourselves to comeback and enjoy it much better. The Escalivada was amazing and the service lovely.,. Top notch. Thanks a lot Yaikel!!"
ChIJ3yqC8bIoQg0RJ1UlEkhANaw,3,"The sign on the entrance indices happy hour ""Lunes a mi√©rcoles"", and I additionally asked if the promotion is working before ordering. But I was counted as regular price (also there was extra 10% in my bill, but as I was sitting on terrace and the toppers were nice I feel it normal). After paying I came to ask about price on cocktailes, and waitress said that Happy Hour now longs from Tuesday to Thursday.

I decided not to argue, but next time I'd prefer to go somewhere where I know my expenses in advance..."
ChIJ3yqC8bIoQg0RJ1UlEkhANaw,4,"Nice ""corner bar"" place. Great tapas & wine. Very relaxed. Love this type of place."
ChIJGZABPrIoQg0RbGlKVxUDFp8,5,The burgers were delicious and cooking time was short. Also the staff was really toughtful. It's definitely a fantastic place üòÅüçî
ChIJGZABPrIoQg0RbGlKVxUDFp8,5,"High quality grilled food here, I've eaten here once and ordered delivery many times already"
ChIJGZABPrIoQg0RbGlKVxUDFp8,5,"Great burgers!!! Everything we ate was delicious and they were very friendly.
The place does not do justice to the quality of the food, it is true that they operate a lot with takeout, but we were in the place and both the service and the food were great, a little slow...but there were many of us and now We saw that the kitchen was not enough for more."
ChIJGZABPrIoQg0RbGlKVxUDFp8,5,"The best burgers in Madrid.

Small place, perfect because there is no noise or disturbances.
The flavor of the meat is very good.
The music they play in the perfect eighties.
The owner and the cook are super nice.

Our favorite burger place."
ChIJGZABPrIoQg0RbGlKVxUDFp8,5,"Very very delicious food.
This place had been recommended to us and we decided to try it during this ""confinement"". We called to have it delivered at a specific time and they were super punctual and the food was hot
The starters were very good, we ordered mozzarella sticks and we had ordered chicken fingers but they brought us chicken wings by mistake but they were very delicious
The burgers were top 10, super homemade and with a lot of flavor. We each ordered differently and none of them disappointed. They were quite large and with a lot of flavor. If we liked them this way, I imagine that they must be better in the freshly prepared establishment."
ChIJCwygW7IoQg0R55UAwm4tsjA,5,"Wonderful food, they served you fast ."
ChIJCwygW7IoQg0R55UAwm4tsjA,4,Awesome men√∫ del d√≠a and the waiter was incredible. The portions of the salmon sashimi were very generous!  ;)

ChIJCwygW7IoQg0R55UAwm4tsjA,5,"A very good Japanese food restaurant. Good prices, great service, good sized plates and everything very delicious; both to eat there and to order at home."
ChIJl0CMm1EvQg0RB8Pe60Hg2go,3,"Pizza is pretty good, Napoli style, pasta quite disgusting, I think it is well known for tapas as almost everybody was drinking beer an eating tapas in the terrace"
ChIJl0CMm1EvQg0RB8Pe60Hg2go,5,Food was amazing 1 started 2 mains with 2 drink and 2 dessert for ‚Ç¨39
ChIJl0CMm1EvQg0RB8Pe60Hg2go,1,"We had a pizza in this, so called, restaurant but it was very, very bad.
I think our pizza's was a deepfrozen one that was heated.

Don't go here to eat!!!!"
ChIJl0CMm1EvQg0RB8Pe60Hg2go,2,"Not great, food was not good, really not good"
ChIJl0CMm1EvQg0RB8Pe60Hg2go,5,"A place with a super nice terrace, one of the best in the neighborhood. Raul a charm. The pizza of 10, very good quality. It will become our trusted site"

ChIJqSn3fykpQg0Rh4fj3MtRcWE,3,Normal.
ChIJqSn3fykpQg0Rh4fj3MtRcWE,5,"Muy buen ambiente y camareros muy amables. Servicio r√°pido y atento. No ten√≠amos intenci√≥n de comer nada pero seg√∫n ve√≠amos los platos salir hacia otras mesas no pudimos resistirnos, todo ten√≠a una pinta espectacular! Acabamos pidiendo el salmorejo, las patatas bravas y los calamares a la romana y estaba todo MUY BUENO. Muy sorprendidos de la gran calidad de todos los platos en combinaci√≥n con los precios tan asequibles. Volveremos 100%!"
ChIJqSn3fykpQg0Rh4fj3MtRcWE,5,"We ordered several dishes and they were all delicious (special mention to the torreznos and salad). The staff is attentive and makes sure everything is perfect. In addition, the atmosphere is calm and pleasant, ideal to enjoy a meal with friends or family. Thank you!!!"
ChIJqSn3fykpQg0Rh4fj3MtRcWE,5,"Just opened a little over a year ago, this enclave has unified a luxury menu with a fair and high-quality menu. The salmorejo surprises and the tripe with beans melts in your mouth. Thank you Vero for your great attention."
ChIJqSn3fykpQg0Rh4fj3MtRcWE,5,"I found this place by chance, but it was really very welcoming, the torreznos delicious. I had already eaten but I was left wanting to try their menu, I will return for sure.
Very warm service from the waitress."

ChIJEWWgplEvQg0RwoXPCnxfk7g,5,"It is one of the most welcoming and familiar places I frequent. My partner and I really appreciate the place, they give you good tapas to start and then we order the main course."
ChIJEWWgplEvQg0RwoXPCnxfk7g,5,"The service is great, and the food as well, the truth is that you couldn't ask for more, I will surely visit more times"
ChIJEWWgplEvQg0RwoXPCnxfk7g,5,"I only went to breakfast and I ordered a potato omelet sandwich, it was delicious, I have a big breakfast."
ChIJGxUVX8MvQg0Rpf1q9sG3oew,5,It was all amazing! Great people.
ChIJGxUVX8MvQg0Rpf1q9sG3oew,5,"Sushi y Gatos offers an exceptional sushi experience with fresh, high-quality fish. Their makis are creative and delicious, complemented by perfectly prepared rice. The presentation of the dishes is careful and the service is attentive and friendly. The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy. In general, the quality-price ratio is very good, making it a highly recommended option for lovers of good sushi. A culinary gem worth discovering!"
ChIJGxUVX8MvQg0Rpf1q9sG3oew,5,"Super rich and super good treatment. Finally a sushi place in La Ellipa. Incredible, we will definitely return."
ChIJGxUVX8MvQg0Rpf1q9sG3oew,5,"The food arrived on time, well packaged and fresh. The rolls were delicious, with high quality ingredients and very well presented. The service was friendly and efficient. Without a doubt, an ideal option to enjoy gourmet sushi at home. Totally recommended!"
ChIJGxUVX8MvQg0Rpf1q9sG3oew,4,"Yesterday, walking through the neighborhood we saw this new place and we couldn't resist. The service was excellent and the food was not far behind.

The curried chicken gyozas were a total success. The stewed oxtail, a daring bet for those who want to try new flavors. The classic Dinamita rolls, a 10 out of 10!

We will repeat for sure!"
ChIJ8RrE8bsvQg0R8yI5rix8caE,5,The salte√±as and empanadas are amazing!
ChIJ8RrE8bsvQg0R8yI5rix8caE,3,"Most things like smell, taste, etc. are very good, the salesperson's service is very good, but what seems a little uncomfortable to me is that I eat the chicken after 3 minutes and it seems like it's already cold, so they should improve it. I ate the Chicken the same but I had to heat it up."
ChIJ8RrE8bsvQg0R8yI5rix8caE,1,"One thing that hurt me like a MULE KICK!! The thing is that I was a frequent customer for some years, and how is it possible that this relationship that was going well BREAKS because of an insignificant NAPKIN...,..Read carefully!! NOT TWO.. NOT THREE.. A NAPKIN that I asked for when I bought a chicken and potatoes.
You can't be so MISERABLE!! in life."
ChIJ8RrE8bsvQg0R8yI5rix8caE,3,"It's good, you can tell it's grilled...but they always tend to leave them a little raw. The fries are a 6 and the frozen croquettes. It was the second time and it still doesn't convince me!"
ChIJ8RrE8bsvQg0R8yI5rix8caE,5,"The best charcoal roasted chicken in the area. Good prices :) I read other comments that say that it is raw inside but every time I buy it it is perfect! And with a great flavor... I have never had a problem.
The staff is very nice and always serves with a smile :)"
ChIJWbV_U1AvQg0Rt0ycfiCCVJU,5,Gourmet place. It is a must in Madrid. Unforgetable gourmet experience. Thanks a lot
ChIJWbV_U1AvQg0Rt0ycfiCCVJU,5,Great terrace to order a vermouth or some beers accompanied by some tapas.
ChIJWbV_U1AvQg0Rt0ycfiCCVJU,5,"I just wanted to go to the bathroom but I was embarrassed so I asked for an aquarius. When I left the bathroom the waiter was very kind, telling me that if one day I have an emergency, since I told him that I'm waiting two to three hours until I get to work, that I can go to the bathroom without any problem.
He also gave me a tapa with wings and potatoes next to the Aquarius.

Very friendly and the people show that they come often, there is a good atmosphere"
ChIJWbV_U1AvQg0Rt0ycfiCCVJU,5,"The good thing they have is that they are from Segovia. And Luis is very nice. They too. Everything is very good, I haven't gone for 20 years because I left the ellipa but one day I will stop by. GO TO MADRID AND NOTHING ELSE"
ChIJWbV_U1AvQg0Rt0ycfiCCVJU,4,"Neighborhood bar, it is very small, but it usually has a terrace all year round with a good atmosphere.

Beer place and ideal for having some bravas, the salsa is one of the best in Madrid.

The tapas are very generous, people from the neighborhood usually frequent it"
ChIJv-Fhx1EvQg0RmtVHG3rf70k,5,"We were there for dinner on Saturday at the recommendation of my brother-in-law and we were not disappointed. Especially the stews such as exquisite oxtail and spectacular stewed ear, we missed trying the tripe that didn't fit but they say they are crazy. Apart from the delicious torreznos from Soria and the potatoes, two sauces, roquefort and brava, are delicious. Special mention to the attention of the owners, thank you for the treatment received, we will return for sure."
ChIJv-Fhx1EvQg0RmtVHG3rf70k,4,"Quick service, the delicious appetizer they gave us paella, impeccable cuisine, the girl very fast and attentive gave my nephew his straw for his drink, recommended"
ChIJv-Fhx1EvQg0RmtVHG3rf70k,5,"Perfect family bar for an aperitif or lunch. Everything they have on the menu is delicious, the tripe are exquisite as is the octopus with revolconas, the torreznos, the croquettes, the burrata...all 10 as well as the service and attention. My favorite bar in the La Elipa neighborhood. ü§©üòç"
ChIJv-Fhx1EvQg0RmtVHG3rf70k,4,"Very good place, pleasant service and great tapas.

The only thing wrong is that they should tell people who go out to smoke to move 10 meters further away, so that they don't blow smoke at those of us who are eating on the terrace."
ChIJv-Fhx1EvQg0RmtVHG3rf70k,5,"The best bar we have in the neighborhood without a doubt! Yesterday we ordered some portions and everything was delicious, they are missing the various croquettes that we also ordered, which we loved, they are homemade and were delicious. The portion of revolconas with torreznos was from another world, and finally grilled cuttlefish.
The Pirate Galleon is always a success!"
ChIJMYvJTgsvQg0R3TcKP6bhyAM,5,"Excellent pizzas with an Italian touch, they add a garlic sauce for the edges, they are too good, I loved them, they served me very well and also some incredible craft beers"
ChIJMYvJTgsvQg0R3TcKP6bhyAM,5,I've been a couple of times and I really liked it. It is a modern place with a terrace and the service was good. The pizzas are homemade (in fact you can see how they make them) and tasty. They have variety. I thought it was a hit that they serve La Virgen beers! Something unusual in this neighborhood. Adequate price.
ChIJMYvJTgsvQg0R3TcKP6bhyAM,5,I loved it!!! And the Salmon pizza with avocado is a pleasure on my palate ü§©ü•∞
ChIJMYvJTgsvQg0R3TcKP6bhyAM,5,"Very delicious pizza, we ordered the 4 stagioni and the Neapolitan to take away and we really liked both. We will repeat for sure!"
ChIJMYvJTgsvQg0R3TcKP6bhyAM,5,"Very delicious pizza, good dough, variety, good beer and very attentive service."

ChIJmyVW5E0vQg0R59yavY8XH6A,5,The best arroz (paella) we had in Madrid! Staff is very friendly too. Make sure you order the ‚Äúflan de huevo‚Äù for desert. Super worth it! üòâ
ChIJmyVW5E0vQg0R59yavY8XH6A,5,"We ate mixed paella, tasty and just right. The squid, very good. Small, cozy place, and we saw that it has a menu of the day also on holidays, at a very reasonable price. Very good attention. They also offer takeaway. We will return."
ChIJmyVW5E0vQg0R59yavY8XH6A,5,"We are regular customers because of the ""quality"" of its cuisine, a family restaurant where the pleasant and close treatment makes you feel at home.
The soupy rice that Concha prepares, both with carabineros and lobster, is delicious.
The exquisite stew, with all its ingredients well cooked and abundant, shows the mastery of the cook.
Conclusion, good cuisine, good atmosphere, pleasant service and good price."
ChIJmyVW5E0vQg0R59yavY8XH6A,5,"We ate the menu of the day, on Wednesdays there is a complete stew, ‚Ç¨12 with a drink and dessert. All very good and abundant. On other occasions we have eaten other dishes, all very delicious, especially the spoon dishes and rice dishes. Great value for money."

ChIJ89PR58UvQg0RxJRVbQrZ0ys,1,"Poor service.. orders takes a lot of time even if there are lot of employees inside, before they out every orders it took 30 mins. I order a large fries and drinks but they still gave me a medium one."
ChIJ89PR58UvQg0RxJRVbQrZ0ys,5,I was on vacation in spain and this service was great loved the food and everything very satisfied with this place!
ChIJ89PR58UvQg0RxJRVbQrZ0ys,2,"Please, change the music! Like a broken record, it plays the same damn loop over and over, it can literally drive you crazy!"
ChIJedASoVAvQg0RzhGhToPig_Q,5,Best kebabs I‚Äôve ever tried
ChIJedASoVAvQg0RzhGhToPig_Q,4,"The truth is that it is very good, the potatoes, full of sauce, a 10.
Every time I have ordered takeout it has been perfect for dinner time, however, the times I have eaten there at noon, it is usually a little cold, that's why the 4.
The cooks are very nice and there is a good atmosphere."
ChIJedASoVAvQg0RzhGhToPig_Q,5,"The best kebab in the entire neighborhood, incredible flavor and quantity, they are also very friendly and the place is clean. Out of 10."

ChIJedASoVAvQg0RzhGhToPig_Q,5,"The best discovery! The delicious food, the very clean place and the best, the attention of the owners, super warm and friendly, make you feel at home! I recommend them without a doubt and I already want to return"
ChIJDXE1xHIvQg0R1HJxgMeHeNk,1,"I asked for it to be brought to my house and it took almost 1 hour for them to bring me a simple durum and potatoes and when they brought it it was because I called them three times and they brought it cold, terrible service."
ChIJDXE1xHIvQg0R1HJxgMeHeNk,3,"Except for the kebabs, I always buy there because of proximity, but lately the truth is that it leaves a lot to be desired and especially a few days ago I went very late and they gave us half an empty kebab, the other quarter was salad and 3 pieces of chicken, the bread was not even fully opened, I guess they didn't have much meat and chicken left, but I would have preferred if they had told me that they only had enough for 2 since in total I ordered 4 and they were almost empty"
ChIJDXE1xHIvQg0R1HJxgMeHeNk,2,Do you want to feel mistreated? Come and visit this place where its owner gets upset if you go to buy! Just as you read it! The man gets upset! This man is a psychologist! The heat is bad for you! Incredible but true! We will never return to this place! Not recommended for the treatment! DON'T COME!
ChIJDXE1xHIvQg0R1HJxgMeHeNk,5,"Quiet atmosphere, great beef kebab menu, great attention. I have no complaints."
ChIJDXE1xHIvQg0R1HJxgMeHeNk,2,The kebab is very bad and they give it to you very cold and the meat is very hard and the potatoes add a lot of pepper and if you want to drink another drink that is not on the menu you have to pay 30 cent more for that I recommend the kebab on Santa Irene Street there. They give it to you very well and very hot and the menu for ‚Ç¨6 is worth it
ChIJ4df3XKopQg0R8Y3YIfkcwOE,5,"Great menu del d√≠a, everything we had was very nice. Quiet place with nice decor."
ChIJ4df3XKopQg0R8Y3YIfkcwOE,4,"The food in this place is super delicious, the artichokes are very good, the stew soup had a lot of flavor, the cachopo was too rich for my taste, there were areas that were hard, but the star in the crown of this place is without a doubt the TORRIJA in capital letters. I have not tried one so delicious in all of Madrid and I am a fan of them but since it is nowhere, I could be eating it every day, if you go, do not hesitate to order it, it is an incredible success.
The service was acceptable, the only thing I didn't like was that I understand that they wanted to eat and we felt a little pressured to finish quickly, come on, they gave us the dessert and the bill at the same moment, that's a sign that they are in a hurry, when I left the bathroom with my daughter I heard them say that only the cachopo is missing... that's a bit ugly. The workers are charming, always with a smile. When we left I spoke with the owner and with total sincerity I congratulated him on his torrija. Without a doubt it is a place to repeat, the food is one of the best in Madrid."
ChIJ4df3XKopQg0R8Y3YIfkcwOE,5,"Small, cozy and cozy restaurant. We loved their menu with different dishes that are out of the ordinary and with fairly reasonable prices. Everything we tried was very delicious, with careful presentation and acceptable portions.
We ordered the oxtail crepes, the ropavieja cannelloni and the cheeks on roast sweet potato... I couldn't say which dish was tastier!!!üòô And I admit that it was difficult for us to decide because there were other options that we could choose. They attracted attention. It's a shame that today they didn't have the cooked croquettes that we wanted to try at first.
Don't forget to try their desserts!!! Both the cheesecake and the torrija were delicious!!!
The staff is 10. We were served at the table by a young guy who was charming, very friendly and helpful.
We keep it on our list of favorite restaurants for future occasions. It has been a success!üòä"
ChIJ4df3XKopQg0R8Y3YIfkcwOE,5,Great Madrid stew at an affordable price. I loved it. I definitely recommend it. 15 minutes walk from the Retiro metro station. you have to go
ChIJ4df3XKopQg0R8Y3YIfkcwOE,5,Small but authentic place. Good stew with traditional and intense flavor. Attentive and friendly staff. I will return.
ChIJGesVe2gvQg0RfG8KlMkkCHM,4,Tapear
ChIJGesVe2gvQg0RfG8KlMkkCHM,5,"Bachatero atmosphere and good vibes, the people at the bar are very friendly and attentive."
ChIJGesVe2gvQg0RfG8KlMkkCHM,4,Terrace that can be enjoyed in good weather
ChIJGesVe2gvQg0RfG8KlMkkCHM,5,Pleasant. Good treatment and good people.
ChIJGesVe2gvQg0RfG8KlMkkCHM,5,THE BEST BAR AND THE BEST WAITERS
ChIJRwsrFrkpQg0R13tK6fWSKmQ,1,"Very rude waiter/owner. I asked him if I could please go into the bathroom with a 4-year-old girl, which was an emergency and he rudely refused. The bar was empty. If this is how they treat people, I don't even want to think about eating there. The place inside is very shabby and with a rickety terrace on a narrow street where cars pass you almost brushing against you. They don't feel like it either... But the most unfortunate thing is that there are people who work in front of the public with this behavior..."
ChIJRwsrFrkpQg0R13tK6fWSKmQ,1,"I go in to have a coffee and when I go down to the bathroom and see that it is busy I knock on the door and they give me another knock on the door instead of saying busy as would have been normal. The light goes out and the door opens and a man's hand comes out to turn on the light because it can't be turned on inside. The men's bathroom was empty but dirty and without paper. When he comes out of the bathroom I tell him that he was wrong and without apologizing or giving me any explanation he tells me that he already knows without any apology as if he didn't care. Seeing that he is the owner, his treatment and lack of education seems amazing to me. If the men's room is dirty and without paper, what you should do is clean it and use the men's room and not use the women's room and take that service away from the clientele. Their attention to the public leaves a lot to be desired. Disastrous treatment by the gentleman."
ChIJRwsrFrkpQg0R13tK6fWSKmQ,1,"I give it one star because I can't give it a minus ten. The service is regrettable, with the man being truly rude and behaving in an unfriendly, rude and rude manner with a three-year-old child in front of other parents and other children who we went to meet after school for some coffees and Colacaos. The unemployment line has much more professional people with better feelings. It is already known throughout the neighborhood that what this man is doing is also dealing with other people going through the same experience of lack of education."
ChIJRwsrFrkpQg0R13tK6fWSKmQ,5,"I have eaten the menu of the day several times in this place, and the truth is that the owner is the waiter and the cook woman, both very nice and I have not had any problems. The quality and price ratio of the menu of the day is good, 10 euros including starter, main course, dessert, drink and bread."
ChIJRwsrFrkpQg0R13tK6fWSKmQ,1,"The minimum I can give is one star, but it doesn't deserve it.
Bad attention from the staff, we bothered them wherever we were (they asked us to move on several occasions).
We had booked in advance, but they didn't have anything, it was impossible to get them to give us something to eat tapas.
The best of all was the waiter, who insisted and insisted until he managed to throw us out; attitude that attracts a lot of attention for these times, TRULY REGRETTABLE!!"
ChIJBbsna_MpQg0RWz_VwArxH6Q,1,Expensive for a concession. The Latin waiter is nice. The lady with orange hair opens her mouth and raises the bread. They handle bread without gloves
ChIJBbsna_MpQg0RWz_VwArxH6Q,1,"Terrible service, to put it mildly. Empty cafeteria but it bothers him that you move two tables that he forces you to place later despite doing NOTHING looking at your cell phone. They don't serve at the table, they give you a voice from the bar to pick up your things, he reported with the empty cafeteria. They don't have anything from the ‚Äúmenu‚Äù until 12:30. A rubbish. Luck"
ChIJBbsna_MpQg0RWz_VwArxH6Q,3,"The food is at home, it is for eating quickly when you go to the pools but you can't expect much more. The service is very rushed, although they strive to be as efficient as they can. The dining room is fresh and spacious, very comfortable."
ChIJBbsna_MpQg0RWz_VwArxH6Q,1,"Expensive for the place it is, for two soft drinks, a juice and a bag of snacks they charge us ‚Ç¨8.50!
Our experience helps us not to enter again, unless the concession changes and prices drop."
ChIJBbsna_MpQg0RWz_VwArxH6Q,1,"They just charged me ten euros for a disgusting menu. Now I understand that they charge you before they give you the food. On top of that, they force you to listen to reggaeton while you're eating. avoid this site at all costs"
ChIJ08J7ATUvQg0RPeCUmUGmCn8,5,"The torrenzos are a MUST HAVE!!! Definitely worth the drive, we went to a famous tapas bar in town and by far Bar Peyo exceeded expectations and is now our favorite tapas bar to which we plan on returning! Ask for the  potatoes as well! Soo good!

It won the night! Don't miss out!"
ChIJ08J7ATUvQg0RPeCUmUGmCn8,4,"After the disappointment of the Gale√≥n Pirata for the treatment, we went to Peto Tapas Bar, we sat on the terrace, excellent service, some very good torreznos, some bravas al puff pastry that I had never tried before that surprised us all, b a portion of a variety of very delicious sausages, we will try the omelette and Tostas, the right price, I will definitely try it, because we will return.
I recommend it"
ChIJ08J7ATUvQg0RPeCUmUGmCn8,4,"Neighborhood bar with good portions. It has access from two places, with two rooms and a terrace. The atmosphere is cheap, but the food is very good. The attention is good too. Recommendation of the bravas puff pastries. They have half portions too. The point of the tortilla is seen in the photos, it can be ordered to taste."
ChIJ08J7ATUvQg0RPeCUmUGmCn8,5,"Pedro and Nicol√°s are a sweetheart, they love animals, dogs are always allowed and they always give them a sausage and give them water üòç. Their tortillas and torreznos are spectacular.... We couldn't be more comfortable!! Thanks Peter!!!"
ChIJ08J7ATUvQg0RPeCUmUGmCn8,4,"The potatoes aioli and the paella that they gave us as a tapa were very good. The portion of black pudding with caramelized onion was a little small, (4 pieces) there were 4 of us. Otherwise the staff was friendly and fast."
ChIJgU08Aw8pQg0Rf3pnHE34cKc,5,I celebrated my birthday here tonight and the pasta was phenomenal and unique. I had a pasta with pistachio sauce and my friend had a pasta with beer in the sauce which was also excellent! I will definitely add this to my list of must visit places in Madrid!
ChIJgU08Aw8pQg0Rf3pnHE34cKc,4,"Nice authentic Italian food. We had parmigiana, risotto and tortelli. They were very nice and tasty. Focaccia was nicely done. I found it a little bit expensive. The place doesn't give any Italian vibes which is a shame because it could enhance the experience even more."
ChIJgU08Aw8pQg0Rf3pnHE34cKc,5,Came here and had the long set lunch menu. 3 course with a drink. Delicious and great value! Canoli was delightful with a crunchy shell.
ChIJgU08Aw8pQg0Rf3pnHE34cKc,5,Meal was delicious! Best spaghetti with seafood I have ever eaten! Nicely served in pappilot as swan. Rest of friends were happy with their dish as well :) we will come next time once in Madrid again :)
ChIJgU08Aw8pQg0Rf3pnHE34cKc,5,We live around the corner from Casa Crimi. Ordered the calzone Rosso and Diavala for takeaway. Both delicious and priced reasonably. Will be returning!
ChIJUyYuasQpQg0RqtuG908bWQ8,1,"Despotic and arrogant treatment towards a person with celiac disease. They think that being celiac is a craving. They were warned and boasted that they were used to dealing with athletes with celiac disease and later realizing that it was all a lie. Both dinners and lunches were reserved in advance. All this in a Spanish Swimming Championship.
We talk about dirt on tables in another chapter."
ChIJUyYuasQpQg0RqtuG908bWQ8,1,The super sharp bar waiter serves you reluctantly and no matter what time you go from 5:00 p.m. he says that the kitchen is closed and they never have the sandwiches that they display at the entrance of the cafeteria.
ChIJbSSsF04vQg0R7de8bCw8Q_0,5,"Everything here is wonderful, from the love and flavor of the homemade food to the family atmosphere of the place, ending with Milagros' wonderful smile. Her hand in the kitchen (better lentils than my grandmother's) and her close attention made the meal with my friends something incredible. Thank you so much!"
ChIJbSSsF04vQg0R7de8bCw8Q_0,5,"The menu of the day is very rich, good flavors.
Good service, very attentive.
To repeat."
ChIJbSSsF04vQg0R7de8bCw8Q_0,5,Unbeatable service. Very good quality. Variety in meals. Very agile and willing staff.
ChIJbSSsF04vQg0R7de8bCw8Q_0,5,"Extraordinary attention. Super loving staff. Quality/ Previous, outstanding.
Delighted with the treatment received"
ChIJbSSsF04vQg0R7de8bCw8Q_0,5,"The daily menu and the super delicious portions and the excellent service, the girls are super nice and helpful. I would return a thousand times ü´∂"
ChIJF6X5aqkvQg0RsT4gWDeajJ8,5,Everything is super good and very good attention I celebrated my birthday in that place and everyone was happy.
ChIJF6X5aqkvQg0RsT4gWDeajJ8,1,"The first time I went everything was fine, but this time it was inedible Cold bread, little sauce, cold meat... you couldn't eat it."
ChIJF6X5aqkvQg0RsT4gWDeajJ8,5,"Hello, good food, very rich üòã
Better try"
ChIJF6X5aqkvQg0RsT4gWDeajJ8,5,I came again rich
ChIJF6X5aqkvQg0RsT4gWDeajJ8,1,"It no longer exists, the information is not updated"
ChIJxSrev7IoQg0RPKXmUqcdy0E,4,"The restaurant has a family and cozy atmosphere. The food is homemade, of good flavor, and with a seasoning that I personally love. We have always opted for the ‚Ç¨12 menu, and we are satisfied with each visit.

However, care could improve. Although the man is very friendly and is always willing to serve well, the lady and the son could show more courtesy and attention to the customer.

In short, we come back for the good food, but we don't expect much in terms of service."
ChIJxSrev7IoQg0RPKXmUqcdy0E,3,"I've only been there for soft drinks, so I can't speak to the quality of their food, although I've been told it's good. I was there today and they charged us 7.20 for two Coca-Colas and a glass of Rioja wine, which I think is a good price. However, the attention leaves much to be desired. Today it was quite cold and people, who are not careful, constantly left the door open. My friend kindly told the lady at the bar that they could put up a sign similar to the one that says no smoking and she responded very rudely that she can't pay attention to whether or not they close the door. We already know, only advice has been given so that other clients are better. I didn't like the shapes, really."
ChIJxSrev7IoQg0RPKXmUqcdy0E,2,"Food with very low quality products and oil. On the menu I ordered red mullet and the plate contained 3 units the size of anchovies. Upon my observation to the manager he replied ""what do you want in a ‚Ç¨12 menu"" Absolutely unpresentable, I will not return"
ChIJxSrev7IoQg0RPKXmUqcdy0E,1,"A long-standing bar in the neighborhood that I had never gone to eat at but once I lost the desire to return; the food was greasy and of very low quality,,, a lot of dishes to choose from, yes; the two waitresses, the mother and the daughter,,, are the most rude thing I have ever faced; I will not return üòûüòû"
ChIJxSrev7IoQg0RPKXmUqcdy0E,5,"We were eating as a family on Saturday, 11 people, they filled us with food, food that was easy to put inside and of good quality, some portions and a second course.
The good work of the waiters and the concern that nothing was missing was present at all times. Thank you very much for making us feel so good.
The price is just over 20 euros per beard, a gift."
ChIJg6AzYoYpQg0RwtMpje9V7eA,5,Excellent place! Great food!!
ChIJg6AzYoYpQg0RwtMpje9V7eA,4,"The menu, good homemade food and fair dishes, the only thing is that they take time to serve you, there are people who only have an hour to eat, but hey, at least they are very nice..."
ChIJg6AzYoYpQg0RwtMpje9V7eA,4,Good value for money
ChIJg6AzYoYpQg0RwtMpje9V7eA,5,"Very good, they were waiting for us after finishing the CONCERT OF YO FUY a EGB, AND EVERYTHING VERY DELICIOUS and fast.... Except for the broken eggs with ham. They were not broken but mixed with ham, quality price, PERFECT A 10"
ChIJg6AzYoYpQg0RwtMpje9V7eA,5,Super good place for breakfast (it's where we went). The tortilla is great and the toast is very delicious.
ChIJm14S2kcpQg0RSC5yUjZyClY,5,"During a trip to Madrid I was brought to this amazing restaurant by my cousin: the owner, Jose, and his team made us feel like at home! Great food, relaxing atmosphere and a welcoming team made our visit an unforgettable experience!
Highly recommended!"
ChIJm14S2kcpQg0RSC5yUjZyClY,5,"On a family trip to Madrid this wonderful restaurant was recommended to me by a friend and it did not disappoint!  The service was exceptional, as a family of 4 we had visited the restaurant near opening time and the owner Jos√© Luis even spent some time chatting with us and making us feel very welcome, it was interesting to hear some of the history of the restaurant :) .  We had a couple of fussy eaters but nothing was too big an ask for the team.

The food was absolutely gorgeous, easily our best meal in Madrid.  Specifically I must recommend the Garlic/chilli king prawns and the Ribs, just beautiful!

An absolute must visit if you want to experience beautiful authentic Spanish food at a reasonable price with five star customer service"
ChIJm14S2kcpQg0RSC5yUjZyClY,5,Excellent lunch. Check this place out.
ChIJm14S2kcpQg0RSC5yUjZyClY,5,What a great restaurant! The food was delicious and the team are really friendly and professional. Highly recommended!
ChIJm14S2kcpQg0RSC5yUjZyClY,5,"What a wonderful restaurant! We were recommended to visit by a friend while on our trip to Madrid. The warm welcome by the staff, the quality of the food and drink were all excellent. When I return to Madrid I will definitely be back."
ChIJ7dai2E8vQg0RIrhy71vzlNM,5,"Incredibly nice staff, they were patient with my broken Spanish, found food for me that i would like (their cheese is delicious) and even gave me complimentary ham (i think it was ham?). Has the atmosphere of very small family dinner, but honestly the best place I've eaten in Madrid so far. The prices were great as well."
ChIJ7dai2E8vQg0RIrhy71vzlNM,5,Delicious Spanish Omelette!!
ChIJ7dai2E8vQg0RIrhy71vzlNM,5,Bar in the Elipa neighborhood. Its mother and son owners. Marisa and Oscar serve him phenomenal. The snacks are not missing. They have a lot of variety drinks at a good price. What more could you ask for...
ChIJ7dai2E8vQg0RIrhy71vzlNM,5,"The Lomo sandwich was good, Good service and speed.
Inside they had a wide variety of snacks to snack on."
ChIJ7dai2E8vQg0RIrhy71vzlNM,5,"The potato omelette, the Saturday paella and the service is excellent.
The appetizers are great, the service is very familiar, it's a pleasure to enter.
I recommend it 100%"
ChIJ4bDwcIgvQg0RrJKEL65fNN4,5,"We have come to try the tapa of the neighborhood's ""customer spoon"" initiative. We didn't know this place and we were delighted. The tapa, without a doubt the best we have tried, but also, the service has been unbeatable. The girl was very nice, and she also had the kindness to let us in with the dog. Highly recommended!"
ChIJ4bDwcIgvQg0RrJKEL65fNN4,5,"Excellent service, majestic atmosphere, impeccable and delicious appetizers, recommended üëå"
ChIJ4bDwcIgvQg0RrJKEL65fNN4,1,"I went down from Ascao to La Elipa to see this place. They had told me about the half-Dominican bar. I like to frequent Dominican bars. I drank two-thirds of the beers. The first one they gave me an appetizer of a salchich√≥n canap√©, which cost 1 euro, and then second a canap√© of I don't know what it looked like gratin cheese with a little onion for the hot dogs I was very disappointed first the music at one of the romantic afternoon for couples or for women and another is that the paella they made was only offered to the family and parents, nothing at all, just the canap√©s, first and last time I came in, thank you"
ChIJ4bDwcIgvQg0RrJKEL65fNN4,5,"A phenomenal place, to laugh, dance, share...etc. and best of all the friendliness and kindness of the waitresses. A reference site."
ChIJ4bDwcIgvQg0RrJKEL65fNN4,5,"Everything is exceptional, you feel at home, very nice people and very professional.
And on top of that, a target to play with."
ChIJcQ0xmusvQg0R_A3SqEexyzY,5,You have to come see this pizza and this spectacular burger. Everything from 100. Don't stop coming. It doesn't look like what you see
ChIJcQ0xmusvQg0R_A3SqEexyzY,5,"I have to say that the dinner I had with a friend was spectacular. To begin with, you see a small, practical, comfortable environment without so many people. It has current background music, and a unique decoration between alcohol and Star Wars. To start with the starter they gave us small sandwiches, very good; I ordered an Iberian, the pizza was spectacular and this complemented the drink. And I have to say something else, you don't have to stop going, it's a small Spanish business and you have to support the entrepreneur."
ChIJcQ0xmusvQg0R_A3SqEexyzY,5,There is a variety of burgers and pizzas and they are served very quickly. It has a terrace!!!!
ChIJcQ0xmusvQg0R_A3SqEexyzY,5,"It is a neighborhood restaurant, I have tried several pizzas and hamburgers and they are very delicious. Price/quantity ratio 5/5"
ChIJcQ0xmusvQg0R_A3SqEexyzY,5,"It is one of the traditional burgers that you would make at home. Good size, very juicy, and with the usual classic ingredients. I will return."
ChIJweCRgaApQg0RBYBX42-UFnY,1,"A tiny kiosk next to a hospital. No place to sit, one vendor only. It was raining, and not pleasant at all.

Not all regular Rodilla menu present. It took 5 min to get us out be coffee and two snacks."
ChIJweCRgaApQg0RBYBX42-UFnY,1,"Bad service. The gentleman who answers seems to have woken up today in a bad mood. He served me short coffee, a half-sized Americano. When I asked for hot water, he reluctantly gave it to me. I don't understand how they can leave their house like that. They should fire him. I just read reviews that indicate I'm not the only one. So many people who want to work. This man better stay at home."
ChIJweCRgaApQg0RBYBX42-UFnY,2,"Sandwiches in line with what Rodilla offers. However, the fact that they charge you ‚Ç¨1.92 for a coffee and it is not of very good quality has made me stop going. As a comparison, in the hospital cafeteria, the same coffee costs ‚Ç¨1.60"
ChIJweCRgaApQg0RBYBX42-UFnY,4,It is small but very practical. Just enough to grab something quick. It is a good option considering that there are many expensive places in the area and it is fine if you don't want to spend a lot.
ChIJweCRgaApQg0RBYBX42-UFnY,2,"On May 20 of this year, I ordered a salad, a Coca Cola zero and a bottle of water for a total of ‚Ç¨10.52. I saw that the saleswoman had correctly scanned my Rodilla Club code. However, the points have not been added and it has already been 4 days. I have written to customer service from the app and they do not respond. I haven't even received a confirmation email about my query. If their scanner is broken, they should fix it, and if not, at least answer customers' emails."
ChIJK_e6bkUvQg0REFM78f-lZpY,5,"Great place ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê the food was delicious, the staff smiley and very kind. At La Forina you can try the Spanish traditional food and to feel home atmosphere. We have spent three nights in Madrid and we have visited La Forina the three evenings. If you visit the restaurant you have to try the octopus and the calamarisüêôü¶ê"
ChIJK_e6bkUvQg0REFM78f-lZpY,4,"Neighborhood Gem of a restaurant. Saw the reviews and decided to try it on my last day in Madrid Spain! Was greeted by a lovely waitress at the bar. She spoke some English and I wanted to try the best that this little La Fornio have to offer. She recommended the Octopus üêô! Right on!
Back to San Francisco California USA üá∫üá∏ tomorrow with fond memories of Madrid Spain üá™üá∏ and a belly full of delicious Octopus üêô from La Fornia!"
ChIJK_e6bkUvQg0REFM78f-lZpY,5,Great restaurant! Always a friendly welcome from staff. We ate here a lot while living in La Elipa
ChIJK_e6bkUvQg0REFM78f-lZpY,5,"Delicious food, friendly staff. We ate entrecot, calamares and bravas, excellent quality."
ChIJK_e6bkUvQg0REFM78f-lZpY,4,"A nice neighborhood joint, with two menus at 13,60 and 20‚Ç¨. We ordered the basic menu. It was honest homemade food. Vegetables for starters, a fillet of beef as entree, curd and honey for dessert. Nice efficient staff. No pretentions. Also dining a la carte available."
ChIJU52pjLIoQg0Rl4KSpOj0kT4,4,Small family run bar restaurant. Reliable and good food. With prices increasing in Madrid this place is a bargain at 12euros got menu del dia. Try it!
ChIJU52pjLIoQg0Rl4KSpOj0kT4,5,"The chef was incredibly nice, he let us in even though the kitchen was closed. he cooked whatever he could at that hour.  it was a lovely experience."
ChIJU52pjLIoQg0Rl4KSpOj0kT4,5,"Best restaurant in madrid, awesome paquito"
ChIJU52pjLIoQg0Rl4KSpOj0kT4,5,Simply Spectacular. Paco is incredible. They treated us like at home. The food is super good. The tripe are super good. Top quality prawns and cockles. Entrec√¥te at its point. The homemade rice pudding is very good. We will repeat soon
ChIJU52pjLIoQg0Rl4KSpOj0kT4,5,"Typical Spanish restaurant, excellent food and generous portions. Very nice owner and staff. Thank you so much."
ChIJl-X8nVEpQg0RJxhs4QEqbds,5,"Great burgers, with a lot of different interesting options! We got the tequenos which came with a delicious sauce (like a spicy mayo), the Brie burger, the bbq burger, and the red velvet cake. The red velvet cake was so soft and tasted super fresh. Great ambiance inside as well with decor from US and breweries."
ChIJl-X8nVEpQg0RJxhs4QEqbds,1,"We have ordered two burgers, well done was dry and burnt , onion fried; medium was full of blood, taste of the blood completely killed the taste of the burger. I cannot recommend this place for food, every GOIKO grill is way better than this one. Big disappointment‚Ä¶
In the bathroom there is only cold in sink.

From the other hand, nice music and nice waitress, good place for two beers."
ChIJl-X8nVEpQg0RJxhs4QEqbds,5,Would 100% recommend this restaurant. Very small with fresh food and one if the best desserts we have ever tasted! Giselle was very welcoming and made excellent recommendations for starters and extra sauces. Will definitely return!!
ChIJl-X8nVEpQg0RJxhs4QEqbds,5,"Great little place for a burger and a beer.
Friendly service!!"
ChIJl-X8nVEpQg0RJxhs4QEqbds,5,"My family and I found this little spot on Google while in Madrid! One of thee best meals we had while there! The ribs, burgers and guacamole were outstanding. And definitely get curry special sauce! Arlo was the best host and although we did not speak Spanish he was very accommodating! If you are thinking of going here DO IT! You will not regret it!"
ChIJdewVgIApQg0Rj6vOeHEB51A,5,"Excellent choice of red wine, great service. Really nice wait staff."
ChIJdewVgIApQg0Rj6vOeHEB51A,5,"Una joya escondida en Madrid. Vinos y cervezas muy pensadas, m√∫sica excelente, y trato 10.

This place is just one of my favorites in Madrid, a hidden jewel, bit appart from the crowd. Good wines, nice music, better staff."
ChIJdewVgIApQg0Rj6vOeHEB51A,5,Great place!!
ChIJdewVgIApQg0Rj6vOeHEB51A,5,"Excellent tapas with your wine or beer. Interesting discussions on Wednesdays and live music on weekends at aperitif time.

Careful attention and good atmosphere. Everything you expect from a good neighborhood bar."

ChIJvdz1aIspQg0RD6cg_TAJqVQ,5,"Good bar, nice, cold beer, gluten-free availability, friendly...."
ChIJDX_dXhcoQg0RJTWdo0eNjww,2,"They poured me an incomplete glass of aquarius, the waitress hid the rest of the jar under the bar, probably to drink laterüòÅI paid for the entire drink.
Dirty sticky table.
Tapas are good"
ChIJDX_dXhcoQg0RJTWdo0eNjww,5,"Great neighborhood bar. Friendly and pleasant employees. Cold beers, varied and delicious appetizers. Also cheap. What more can we ask for?"
ChIJDX_dXhcoQg0RJTWdo0eNjww,3,Bareto neighborhood of the whole life. Short and at the foot. Maybe the waitress was a bit rude! (Not by Puccini).
ChIJDX_dXhcoQg0RJTWdo0eNjww,1,"Yesterday, May 26, 2023, we went around 11:00 a.m. to have breakfast like almost every day and they gave us bread from the previous day and as well as other days. We will not return again‚Ä¶breakfast prices are skyrocketing and it is not a question of them giving us late bread"
ChIJDX_dXhcoQg0RJTWdo0eNjww,5,"Good bar in the heart of the neighborhood, very delicious beer and food and a wonderful terrace! Highly recommended!"
ChIJDSDY8y0pQg0RlSGDBCsN_4s,5,Here is a lot of delicious chicken broth sauce.very tasty
ChIJDSDY8y0pQg0RlSGDBCsN_4s,5,"I ordered the falafel menu with potatoes and a drink. Everything was very delicious, the homemade potatoes with parsley and very good flavor. The falafel is very light, tasty and not at all greasy. The roast chickens looked very good too and the place is super clean."
ChIJDSDY8y0pQg0RlSGDBCsN_4s,5,Excellent service and everything is great and super cheap. That's lovely
ChIJDSDY8y0pQg0RlSGDBCsN_4s,5,Very tasty and low price.

ChIJb8yyUbMpQg0RLtHW6aW7vR0,5,"Perfect fine dining experience. The food was very special, prepared to perfection with the waiters skillfully introducing each dish. The location is beautiful with a little outside terrace to have a drink and then a calm, clean, comfortable inside space with just 5 tables. The service is exquisite with the waiters taking time to explain each dish and you feel really connected to them.

I read some other reviews re the service and cannot believe them. We had a lovely experience tonight and cannot thank the OSA team enough!"
ChIJb8yyUbMpQg0RLtHW6aW7vR0,5,"We had the most incredible, heartwarming and inspiring dinner at OSA this weekend, making the trip to Madrid from Portugal with one goal only: to experience the magic that is happening at OSA.

Passing through the gate of a beautifully restored old Spanish villa we are greeted with a warm welcome and the offer of aperetifs in the candle lit courtyard - at once it felt as if we were arriving to a friends home for a special evening. Looking around us, the setting is the perfect blend of classic elegance and modern refinement with design led furniture and finishes. We sit with a view through an open window into the kitchen, a glimpse of what to come.

After drinks we are walked to our table past what we can now see is an (incredible!) kitchen and we are greeted by the chefs, Sara and Jorge. We are led to the dining room in the old conservatory, large tables with plenty of space and privacy. The feast begins.

Opening our menu's decorated with handpainted drawings we are lured into a truly exceptional tasting menu focusing on seasonal and local produce from the Iberian Peninsula. Every dish feels like a celebration of the land and sea ‚Äîwhether it's wild-caught seafood, farm-fresh vegetables, or house cured cuts of local Iberian meats. The dish make ups are seemingly simple and unfussy, yet the flavours are vibrant, almost nostalgic at times and thoughtfully paired. The chefs dedication to using the finest regional ingredients ensures a freshness and authenticity that elevates each bite and the cooking points are unlike any other restaurant we have ever eaten at, each ingredient cooked to utter, tender, melt in the mouth, al dente crunch, crisp perfection.

From subtle flavors to mains that explode with rich, earthy notes, OSA showcases the best of Iberia‚Äôs culinary heritage in creative and inventive ways. The menu evolves with the seasons, offering something new and exciting with each visit.

A must mention is the service and the incredible team at OSA that make it tick. Each member of the team is immediately kind and attentive, with the expert proffesionalism and consideration of any Michelin starred restaurant. They each guide us through each dish with care and passion, offering insights into the provenance of ingredients and the inspiration behind the dishes. Wine pairings by new recruit, Alex, were exceptional and we loved his energy, as well as the head waitress (forgive us as her name escapes us!). She is highly knowledgeable, willing to impart extra details and time to show us the smokers and the wine cellar after dinner. The team around them are incredibly discreet and well choreographed, it all felt like being part of a well rehearsed dance.

OSA is a destination for those who appreciate refined and technical, yet truly uncomplicated and grounded cuisine (imo the future of this type of dining) led by some of the world's finest ingredients found here in Spain in an intimate and beautifully crafted setting. It‚Äôs the kind of place that has left a long lasting impression on us and that we will remember, not only for its food but for its ability to make you feel like part of something truly special. It's a shame that 10 stars on Google do not exist, but surely Michelin will award more for this breath taking gem.

Bravo! Emma + David"
ChIJb8yyUbMpQg0RLtHW6aW7vR0,5,"OSA is an excellent restaurant. French and Japanese technics meet with an amazing product  around matured fish and hunting. Strong and different flavours that will not let anybody unmoved. Service is great, the wine list stunning (but pricey) and the venue cosy and elegant"
ChIJb8yyUbMpQg0RLtHW6aW7vR0,5,"Away from the main business and shopping district but worth the trip. You can smell the seducing cooking smoke from the street when you arrive. One of the most interesting and young cooking talent in Madrid. Hard to get tables. Space with nordic inspiration, but perhaps would need better sound isolation. Open kitchen at the entrance. Let yourself flow in the different plates. I was specifically surprised with the Lengua (cow tongue)."
ChIJb8yyUbMpQg0RLtHW6aW7vR0,5,Great ! No complex made up plates but full focus on the ingredients and flavours
ChIJo592ErApQg0RcKMZdmi882E,5,What are the chances of entering a tavern and the owner reading?! A book!!!! The coolest thing about Colonia del Manzanares ü§§
ChIJo592ErApQg0RcKMZdmi882E,5,"Fantastic environment, it's like being in the 70s, the skewers are very delicious, and the cane is pulled in the old fashioned way. highly recommended overall"
ChIJo592ErApQg0RcKMZdmi882E,5,The best in the area for an aperitif.
ChIJo592ErApQg0RcKMZdmi882E,5,Good place for an aperitif with its terrace!!!
ChIJo592ErApQg0RcKMZdmi882E,5,Very nice üòÄ
ChIJDQgUvCIoQg0RltRWRvjWwdc,3,"I was there a few weeks ago and when I got down around 9:30 p.m. To order a sandwich there was no bread, or they had many sandwich dinners before I came down or they usually go short on bread so there is no leftover.

The omelet was just right and luckily the very skillful waiter offered me a whole wheat roll that was left.

It must be said that they offered me some sandwiches but the price seemed very excessive to me.

I don't know if what happened is normal, but if you plan to have a sandwich for dinner, I advise you to order it early or leave it in order at noon (although I don't know if they will allow the latter)."
ChIJDQgUvCIoQg0RltRWRvjWwdc,4,"The cafeteria and restaurant are very good for eating or having a snack. They have food a la carte. The menu is a little overpriced for being in a hospital but the quality is very good and the quantity is generous. Very clean. The staff is very attentive, even with unusual requests. The squid and anchovy sandwiches in vinegar are very delicious."
ChIJDQgUvCIoQg0RltRWRvjWwdc,1,"The prices don't make sense. They charged me 7.80 euros for a portion of Russian salad that would leave a child hungry.
The staff is very friendly and attentive, but the prices are to take advantage of the situation.
If it can help anyone, less than 5 minutes walk away are the faculty cafeterias, incredible prices (10 menu voucher, with first, second and dessert for 62 euros) and better quality, or even on the street of the hospital there are Much better options.
Don't let them take advantage of your situation, or your pocket."
ChIJDQgUvCIoQg0RltRWRvjWwdc,2,"The prices they have for the place where it is located seem amazing to me.
Almost all of us who go there do so because we have someone hospitalized, so many times we have no choice but to go down for breakfast, lunch or dinner and it is a shame that they take advantage of other people's misfortune in this way.
Finally, comment that the quality they offer of their products is normal and is at no time proportional to their cost."
ChIJDQgUvCIoQg0RltRWRvjWwdc,5,"The exquisite food. Good product and well made. They have a menu of the day for ‚Ç¨15 and a menu with fish, meat, salads, creams, pastas and even mixed dishes. Excellent service, friendly, fast and attentive staff. Very professional."
ChIJC8J92xYoQg0RZuNw40Qx5mA,5,"Fantastic club, we went there on a really good Jazz night (Lluis Coloma) and the atmosphere, music and service were superb! We didn‚Äôt eat but the food looked great too."
ChIJC8J92xYoQg0RZuNw40Qx5mA,5,"Nice friendly place, very nice food and beer, , excellent prices. Good for kids. Outdoor sitting in summer. Good with children."
ChIJC8J92xYoQg0RZuNw40Qx5mA,5,"They offer great Calamari and olives.
Nice place by the river and nice staff."
ChIJC8J92xYoQg0RZuNw40Qx5mA,3,"The place is beautiful and the service, lovely.

Individual pizzas were burnt and a little too small for the price. The ingredients were OK."
ChIJC8J92xYoQg0RZuNw40Qx5mA,5,"Incredible food experience, amazing service and lovely terrace. This place us located by the river side of Madrid, an outstanding hidden location in the area. I Would definetly recommend and come back. Thank you to Elena for taking care of us, amazing customer service!üëèüèªüëèüèª"
ChIJBaDuM2UpQg0RGJsTFEfjAT0,5,"Just finished a wonderful lunch at Rio Azul. We ordered everything that Alicia recommended and all of it was great, especially the cheese cake topped with Peach jam which paired very well with the Flat Black coffee."
ChIJBaDuM2UpQg0RGJsTFEfjAT0,5,"Lovely place, good value, really tasty sandwiches and delicious cheesecake! Thank you :)"
ChIJBaDuM2UpQg0RGJsTFEfjAT0,5,Cozy and bright local hangout; excellent cortado/espresso; received a complimentary hot chocolate.
ChIJBaDuM2UpQg0RGJsTFEfjAT0,5,Had a lovely lunch here. Good service and good food :)
ChIJBaDuM2UpQg0RGJsTFEfjAT0,5,"I went to eat with my partner and the children, and the truth is that we ate very good homemade food. There were a variety of portions, menu, but above all the burgers stood out, we got very good attention from the 2 girls who served us and we felt at home, and we felt comfortable in each, we noticed that pets can also be admitted and they have vegan options, highly recommended"
ChIJW438JmsoQg0RVQFVdDbAUj0,4,"Finding a fresh paella place in cities other than Valencia seems harder than it seems. We found this place that makes fresh paella after much research. It does take about half an hour to make so come with patience.

The place itself is quite nice and fancy. Stays fairly busy.

The paella was alright in my opinion as someone who was having it for the first time. It was just not something I would get again. The rice very sparsely in there. The crab is there for show. I liked the shrimp and squid.

Overall not a bad experience and we got to try an authentic dish fresh! It is a bit pricey but they have variation of dishes for everyone to pick from besides vegetarians ofc."
ChIJW438JmsoQg0RVQFVdDbAUj0,5,"Old school traditional paella place with no tourists, and lots of older people in a traditional environment that is very bright and overlooking the park from the second floor. Paellas are wonderful and they put a nice date platter on the table afterwards. Just wish they would offer a plain green salad but this is hard to find in Madrid."
ChIJW438JmsoQg0RVQFVdDbAUj0,5,"We started our visit to Madrid by taking a paella cooking class. Although I make a pretty good one (or thought I did!) I learned the proper technique and ingredients. Then we asked around for the best paella restaurant, friends strongly recommended Casa de Valencia. We ordered the seafood paella, it was fantastic and included crab, crayfish, shrimp and mussels. A feast that we thoroughly enjoyed. For a starter we ordered the anchovies with toast and tomato spread, this was sublime, an incredible flavour combination. Along with our dessert orders they brought a complimentary plate of dried fruits and a sweet wine, a nice touch! Add to this the very professional and friendly service (thank you Sergio!) this may have been our best meal in the month we spent in Madrid."
ChIJW438JmsoQg0RVQFVdDbAUj0,5,The first place we stopped by after a 14 hour flight! We were treated with original Spanish food and wine! We love all we ordered especially Arroz Caldoso De Rape. I personally love Pulpo Con Cachelos and Paella. The vibe was great with enthusiastic services of the staff. We could not ask for more! Will definitely come back!
ChIJW438JmsoQg0RVQFVdDbAUj0,5,"Great restaurant and even better service, all the staff were amazing, the authentic Valencian paella and the seafood paella were the best dishes, but everything else was great. If you visit, ask for Sergio, and if you do, make sure to ask him about ""Terri"" for great entertainment whilst you enjoy your paella. Thank you to all!"
ChIJT5FVlmsoQg0RK_jd6VLQkQ8,4,Small tapa bar - not called  El Lago anymore. Now is restaurant Ferraz 39 or something. But free tapa with a drink.  I got potato . I was happy
ChIJT5FVlmsoQg0RK_jd6VLQkQ8,5,"A small place at the back of a bar, but some of the best tapas we have tried in the area. Complimentary potatoes too, but the steak was a real beautiful dish. Everything was fresh. You know its a local favourite when it has poker players at the back."
ChIJT5FVlmsoQg0RK_jd6VLQkQ8,5,"the shop owner and the chef lady all are nice, they served me well and gave me a warm hospitality.
the tapas are delicious and the lemon beer is wonderful.
I feel so grateful to come across El Lagar on the first day of my journey in Madrid."
ChIJT5FVlmsoQg0RK_jd6VLQkQ8,5,"Good food - local vibes.
First day in Madrid I walked around my hotel looking for a quick lunch, and took a chance walking to this place. I don't speak any Spanish, but I manage to order meatball and lemon beer. It was so delicious! The food portion is perfect. Making you full, with some room for desert."
ChIJT5FVlmsoQg0RK_jd6VLQkQ8,5,"Very friendly waiter, and really delicious authentic food with a cheap price(only 11 EUR for the menu - 2019 january). I can only recommend this place!"
ChIJIUc7yGsoQg0RjkuKA4JuLEc,5,"We found this restaurant when looking for something that was open and took reservations when most places were closed on Three Kings Day. It was so good that we found it, we ended up eating dinner here two of our three nights in Madrid. The owner is originally from Italy and sources ingredients from there. Everything we had was delicious from our meal to the wine to the dessert!"
ChIJIUc7yGsoQg0RjkuKA4JuLEc,5,Small and simple pizza place with really friendly staff and great food!
ChIJIUc7yGsoQg0RjkuKA4JuLEc,5,"Really good value and delicious food, and the staff are so kind and attentive - my favourite place for a quick lunch!!"
ChIJIUc7yGsoQg0RjkuKA4JuLEc,5,"Excellent little Italian restaurant, food is delicious. Staff is very nice and is not bothered by English speaking people. I will be going back once in Madrid!"
ChIJIUc7yGsoQg0RjkuKA4JuLEc,4,"Food is great, we have been a few times (mostly takeaway) and overall it is great.
The pizzas are very authentic."
ChIJHT5GKxUoQg0R5PqOKNc6mGI,1,Extremely over priced terrible food! Chicken wings were just deep fried with no flavour and almost inedible.
ChIJHT5GKxUoQg0R5PqOKNc6mGI,4,"Brunch on a slow Sunday with a great view.
Prices are a bit salty, but worth it for the atmosphere."
ChIJHT5GKxUoQg0R5PqOKNc6mGI,2,We had to surrender and do our aperitivo to another of the terrazas with enough service around. They keep adding tables even when they can take care of more customers. I think they can afford more personal looking at the amount of tables and people waiting to pay or order.
ChIJHT5GKxUoQg0R5PqOKNc6mGI,3,"Food it's ok. But nothing spectacular nor out of this world and it does not offer any diffrent from what you can find in many of the average bars in Madrid, the menu is a bit overpriced but the place has the enormous advantage that it closes late so it's definetley sometimes a convinient option."
ChIJHT5GKxUoQg0R5PqOKNc6mGI,3,"The best thing about the bar is the setting at the top of the parque del oeste as it slopes down toward the river. A good place to cool down, especially on a warm summer evening

Especiall"

ChIJnUUzsWooQg0R1TzDcJOe8tE,5,"From the same owners of the O'Rosal Restaurant and a few meters from the original location is this other Restaurant.
It has a terrace and a small living room.
Menu of the day and portions in a pleasant atmosphere.
Elene's kindness and good treatment is appreciated."
ChIJnUUzsWooQg0R1TzDcJOe8tE,5,"Fast, the food is good and the service excellent.
Elena and Mar√≠a are lovely.
I recommend the terrace."
ChIJnUUzsWooQg0R1TzDcJOe8tE,4,"A nice cafeteria also has lunch menus at an acceptable price.
The staff that attends it is also quite pleasant and it has a terrace in summer that is good."
ChIJnUUzsWooQg0R1TzDcJOe8tE,5,"I love this place both for tapas and for eating, Elena the waitress is a lovely person."
ChIJ7evaU2ooQg0RUI-zKbWR5EY,4,"Super busy, super crowded. The tortilla with onion was so delicious, and the albondigas were also tasty. The portion was quite okay. I would definitely return for the food, not much for the vibe."
ChIJ7evaU2ooQg0RUI-zKbWR5EY,5,They serve the best tortilla de patata in Madrid. Highly recommended.
ChIJ7evaU2ooQg0RUI-zKbWR5EY,5,"This place is a neighborhood gem! We ate here each night of our stay in Madrid after our first visit. The food is delicious, the staff are friendly, and the atmosphere can‚Äôt be beat. They specialize in tortilla & croquetas, all of which are great. We had tortilla (chistorra, cebolla caramelizada con cabral, and puerro), croquetas (boletus, cabrales, ib√®rico, and cocido), alb√≤ndigas, and more. Come early and prepare to be patient - it gets increasingly busy as the evening progresses & the servers are moving on all cylinders. It‚Äôs definitely a popular spot with locals. The whole place was packed, indoors & outdoors, each night, and everyone is happy to be there. Our guy Jose is A++! It‚Äôs a few blocks away from Arg√ºelles station (Yellow 3 line on the Metro heading towards Moncloa). Make the trip to Casa Paco, and have a bit of tortilla for us."
ChIJ7evaU2ooQg0RUI-zKbWR5EY,5,Best tortilla I had in Madrid. I ve took 3 pinchos.. 1 salmon & Roquefort 1 tortilla classic with onions + 1 tortilla with peppers and caramelizwd onions. This last one was prob not the best because peppers arrived a bit too cold .. but I give 5 anyway because the overall taste was unbelievable. I ll be back for sure
ChIJ7evaU2ooQg0RUI-zKbWR5EY,4,"If you want a really good & tasty tortilla in Madrid , this is your place ‚ùóYou have to try the tortilla with salmon and Rockford, it's delicious. The prices are so good and the staff is friendly & kind. Highly recommend it."
ChIJqfpDE2woQg0RbqKN0cV275A,5,"I had a wonderful glass of sangria con cava for ‚Ç¨7.50 and got two different complimentary snacks (nuts and crisps). The bartender was very friendly, and I enjoyed sitting outside in the sun. Hold onto your food and napkins though, especially if the wind is strong!

For my drink, I'm glad that I was given a paper straw instead of a plastic one.

In terms of covid-prevention measures, there was ample seating to socially distance and there were no tangible menus. There are QR codes on the table but as a tourist relying on WiFi, that was of no use to me. I only had one drink but it was a great one in a good atmosphere.
@deeyandrax"
ChIJqfpDE2woQg0RbqKN0cV275A,1,They tried to sell us a 6‚Ç¨ wine saying it was crianza when it was only table wine. Cheese was good. Food was terrible. Will never come back.
ChIJqfpDE2woQg0RbqKN0cV275A,1,We were charged for something we didn‚Äôt get and they continued to argue with us. Very rude. Food and drinks not quality. Do not recommend!
ChIJqfpDE2woQg0RbqKN0cV275A,1,"Liars. The waiter tells you that the paella is for two people but:
1) That‚Äôs only true for the rice; the seafood more than suffices for one person; and
2) They charge you TWICE what it says on the menu. Never seen that in my life.
They deserve to go out of business soon."
ChIJqfpDE2woQg0RbqKN0cV275A,5,The food has amazing taste and the staff is very kind. The price is good. I really recommend them.
ChIJ6wpv9msoQg0RHrw6WBBR4II,5,"Very lovely place, good prices and wonderful service.
Many thanks to Mohammed who was very kind and helpful."
ChIJ6wpv9msoQg0RHrw6WBBR4II,5,English spoken. Great place for international students. Cold beer and cheap tapas. Unbelieveable drinks and spirits. Thursdays on fire!
ChIJ6wpv9msoQg0RHrw6WBBR4II,5,Good snacks. Good service. Very nice host:)
ChIJ6wpv9msoQg0RHrw6WBBR4II,5,Wonderful food and service.

The vegetable grill is especially delicious üëåüèº
The water in Madrid is excellent and they will bring you a jug without any problem if you ask for it.

Restaurant checks are worth it ‚úÖ"
ChIJXdLaz2soQg0R4KdjYIs0iPM,4,"Nice service and ambient. Good price for a gente al restaurant too. Food is genuine and server smart, there is a lot of choice and a selection of pescados fish. I took the calamaras with alioli sauce and I would have liked a ton more."
ChIJXdLaz2soQg0R4KdjYIs0iPM,5,Nice place & helpfully people to serve you the food you wish to eat
ChIJXdLaz2soQg0R4KdjYIs0iPM,5,"Excellent restaurant, excellent food, excellent service. We definitely will be back."
ChIJXdLaz2soQg0R4KdjYIs0iPM,1,Very bad management and service. Waiters forget about you if you are dining outside. Hardly give you time to express yourself and ask all necessary questions pertaining to your order. They are in a constant rush and it felt like I was in a fast food with fast service. Speed doesn‚Äôt determine quality. The spaniards need to understand this. Its a shame because the food is tasty but the service is unstable
ChIJXdLaz2soQg0R4KdjYIs0iPM,4,"5-star food, but a bit weak on the service side, although the staff is friendly and the premises great. Took 15 min to place the order, asked for some more wine and water with the main course and got it when I had already finished eating. Got black coffee rather than the one I had ordered... Just minor details, but still relevant enough not to give an overall 5 star."
ChIJRzd6fmkoQg0RbTHvsvtbXvs,5,"We came for merienda (Spaniard snack) and it was super tasty. The sandwiches were fresh and delicous. The desserts were so sweet and delicate. The drinks were freshly made. The food and atmosphere was great and pleasant. Carolina and the rest of the team were professional, kind, and friendly. She was customer driven and answered our questions. Make sure to come to Viena when you are in Madrid, Spain. üá™üá∏ THANK YOU SO MUCH, Carolina. üòâü§ó"
ChIJRzd6fmkoQg0RbTHvsvtbXvs,5,Great staff and tasty cakes ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChIJRzd6fmkoQg0RbTHvsvtbXvs,1,"Poor quality and horrible service
They did not take my order down so they forget about my avocado toast while everyone on the table was eating, they don‚Äôt ask or care about this.
The waiters are the worst, if you don‚Äôt ask they don‚Äôt tell you what is available to drink so If you ask they scream to tell you they don‚Äôt have the smoothies or nothing or drink, and they don‚Äôt help the customer as they should be. They don‚Äôt even wait until you figured it out by yourself what to drink, as If it was a to go order.
Also the toast was horrible, the jam was cold.
As a tourist this is the worst experience ever, I don‚Äôt recommend to go here."
ChIJRzd6fmkoQg0RbTHvsvtbXvs,5,Good service and nice people.
ChIJRzd6fmkoQg0RbTHvsvtbXvs,5,Nice place with good food
ChIJb3AmSLcpQg0RjmvxFGVD8fk,1,Worst experience in Madrid. Took more than 1 and a half hours to prepare the order forgetting some of the things we ordered.
ChIJb3AmSLcpQg0RjmvxFGVD8fk,1,"We stayed for 3 hours to eat a grilled vegetable, some croquettes (they are frozen) and a grilled meat. The service is very slow, they made a mistake with the drink and lost our order.
The barbecue costs ‚Ç¨49 and it's not worth it, the meat is good, but the quantity is very small for that price and they serve it with frozen potatoes and five local peppers, a shame.
The only good thing is that the terrace is good and the waiters are friendly, the rest is a disaster. I won't come back."
ChIJb3AmSLcpQg0RjmvxFGVD8fk,5,"The reviews that we have read, at least from our experience, do not do it justice, they give them very low scores that can make you not choose the site and we do not believe that is the case. Despite it being Sunday at 2:30 p.m., they served us quickly, the food is good, good value for money, the terrace on a sunny day like today was great and the kids had a great time on such a spacious terrace with views of the river. Advisable."
ChIJb3AmSLcpQg0RjmvxFGVD8fk,1,"We sat down on a Sunday at 2:40 in the afternoon, ordered some drinks and two portions of food. They brought us drinks. An hour later they still didn't bring us the appetizer or the food, despite having insisted repeatedly. After 1 hour and 20 waiting, we decided to leave. Since they were taking too long to charge us, we went inside to pay. They didn't even have the food order written down on our table. If I say this place is a disaster, I'm an understatement. Oh, on top of that, very expensive prices."
ChIJb3AmSLcpQg0RjmvxFGVD8fk,3,"The waiters are friendly but they are a disaster. They take a long time, they made a mistake in the order and there is not a single trip in which they know what table they have
A shame because location and food are quite decent"
ChIJPfWf2REpQg0Rzm7vSEce7Ik,1,"A disaster, we were on the terrace, we asked for shade and they gave it to us and then the table behind arrived later, yes, we had to order the drinks multiple times, and the food took an awful lot of time, we started at 2:30 and ended up without coffee at 5:30.
I'm sorry that a nice place on the terrace is so bad."
ChIJPfWf2REpQg0Rzm7vSEce7Ik,3,"The place is spacious, it has many tables. The food is good. The problem they have is that they are slow in serving, it takes almost two hours to eat. If they solve this, the place is very good to have your menu of the day"
ChIJPfWf2REpQg0Rzm7vSEce7Ik,5,"Everything was perfect, with portions of 2 we ate 3. Recommended"
ChIJPfWf2REpQg0Rzm7vSEce7Ik,4,"We only ate a couple of portions, it wasn't bad at all, the only thing that was cold was teething"

ChIJf_Jh6igpQg0RgLjUUlpudcs,5,A beautiful little spot for Spanish food with a creative twist. You can sit outdoors or indoors. The alcachofas were spectacular.
ChIJf_Jh6igpQg0RgLjUUlpudcs,5,Fluffiest pancake ever and our server Karen was amazing. Come see her and she will take good care of you üíï
ChIJf_Jh6igpQg0RgLjUUlpudcs,5,What a great spot! Beautiful sunny place and terrace with lovely service to match. I just had a pincho de tortilla but will be back for more.
ChIJf_Jh6igpQg0RgLjUUlpudcs,5,Had a great lunch at y Lucientes today. We don't speak a word of Spanish but our waiter Kevin was superb in translating the meal of the day and attending to our needs.  Food was perfect. Thank you and big thumbs up to Kevin!
ChIJf_Jh6igpQg0RgLjUUlpudcs,5,"Very nice cozy restaurant only steps away from Goya‚Äôs statue. We ordered salmon tartare, pork cheeks and duck artichoke dishes and everything came out perfectly. Our server, Kevin went above and beyond to accommodate our group with a child who had severe nuts allergies. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!"
ChIJe-sxRgApQg0R8OZl76tB1nU,5,"Amazing spot with specialty coffee and food.
Highlights: the Focaccia and the scones! Don‚Äôt miss out the sunsets at their terrace as there‚Äôs a massive park across the street.
We went a couple of times to repeat our favs.
On our second visit we enjoyed very much the Plato del D√≠a -a fresh and affordable dish they offer on weekdays as a lunch option, and natural wine for a reasonable price.

Next time in Madrid, we‚Äôll be back for their brunch as it looks great.

*If you‚Äôre planning to go on a weekend be aware of their peak times as it could get busy."
ChIJe-sxRgApQg0R8OZl76tB1nU,5,"Amazing cafe with loads of natural light, great coffee & food and incredibly friendly staff! One of my favourite new finds in Madrid"
ChIJe-sxRgApQg0R8OZl76tB1nU,5,Super cute cafe with delicious baked goods and coffee. And dog-friendly. So nice to have this new place by the park!
ChIJe-sxRgApQg0R8OZl76tB1nU,5,The cutest cafe with cinnamon rolls and wine by the glass. A beautiful atmosphere and very friendly staff! See you soon Diego!
ChIJe-sxRgApQg0R8OZl76tB1nU,4,"Wonderful little cafe with a fantastic choice of sweets, including alfajores, cinnamon rolls and a diverse selection of cakes. The coffee is excellent, really nice place to get brewed coffee. Atmosphere and location is top, particularly nice place to be as the sun sets behind Casa de Campo. Service is good, but a little chaotic (I've been twice and the place was packed both times). I recommend a visit!"
ChIJtebW_24pQg0RsHCbSFLJm4w,5,"Great Spanish food, the owner (or just a waiter?) is very nice. The portions are pretty big. They speak English just enough to bring you food and being nice. Highly recommend"
ChIJtebW_24pQg0RsHCbSFLJm4w,5,"I've been dinning at El Piornal for over 20 years fir breakfast and dinner, everything is made fresh and delicious, mostly Spanish meals, very affordable for the high quality you get .. My whole family of 9 siblings and descendents enjoy going there, the staff is also the best."
ChIJtebW_24pQg0RsHCbSFLJm4w,5,"Unassuming, comfortable with excellent food."
ChIJtebW_24pQg0RsHCbSFLJm4w,5,"Excellent menu del dia, very tasty food, good attentive service. Will go again"

ChIJoyea1cQpQg0RnXmgUcPvGx4,5,"The taste of starters, burgers and deserts are all amazing. Great selection of beers. Everything topped up by a great service.
The waiters make a  great overall experience. A truly amazing place"
ChIJoyea1cQpQg0RnXmgUcPvGx4,5,Delicious burger and friendly staff.  Definately will come again next time I'm in Madrid
ChIJoyea1cQpQg0RnXmgUcPvGx4,5,Best hamburgers ever! Great place.
ChIJoyea1cQpQg0RnXmgUcPvGx4,5,
ChIJoyea1cQpQg0RnXmgUcPvGx4,5,"Incredible!!!!
I haven't had a burger like that in a long time. We ordered the nachos, the Bourmet burger and the Blame Canada burger and the last one was amazing, it melted in your mouth.

Apart from that, the excellent treatment for all the service. Camilo attended to us and was unbeatable.

I recommend it 100%"
ChIJcbmt5GooQg0ROmJhy41V4dk,5,All food tasted good especially Paella. Staff are friendly though can only communicate in limited English. The ordering process would  be much easier if they could provide menu in English.
ChIJcbmt5GooQg0ROmJhy41V4dk,3,"In few words | Decent terrace with good draft beer and tapas. Price average to high. Good service depending who's serving üòÖ

I saw one waitress super efficient and attentive, but her colleague was clumsy, forgetting everything, not really knowing how to serve. That stains a bit the reputation this place can achieve."
ChIJcbmt5GooQg0ROmJhy41V4dk,4,Ok for the menu del d√≠a. It gets busy at lunch time.
ChIJcbmt5GooQg0ROmJhy41V4dk,5,Sooo delicious fish and rice in fish broth! Chocolate cake for dessert it‚Äôs my recommendation üôåüèº Careful stuff
ChIJcbmt5GooQg0ROmJhy41V4dk,3,"We had a menu del dia with Caldo Gallego and Filete de ternera. Caldo it was good, but filete it was too dry."
ChIJm3JJX_opQg0RX7sg7xZzKSE,5,"This place deserves a Michelin Star! It's not in the center of Madrid but it deserves comi g from any place in this city. I made a reservation at the Dani  at the  Four Seasons, but because of a glitch in the reservation system, they have to cancel. So, I looked for something different and eclectic near our hotel. Believe me, this is the definition of an experience, the food, the service, (thanks Angel), and the decorations. Come and you will remember this review. Enjoy!"
ChIJm3JJX_opQg0RX7sg7xZzKSE,5,"It‚Äôs a great fancy restaurant with a fabulous international and nouvelle cuisine dishes that you usually only find in the best bistros.
√Ångel was the waiter that serviced us our diner and I really thank his suggestions and kindness.
Osteria Bravissimo it‚Äôs highly recommend for those who really appreciate the service and quality.
Top 25 in Madrid without any doubt!"
ChIJm3JJX_opQg0RX7sg7xZzKSE,4,"It's a good place overall, but you will need to prepare your wallet, as it will be over 40 Euro per person.

I really like the Spanish Russian salad. The food isn't particularly exceptional given the price and the quantity. Although the service is excellent.

They are trying to maintain a standard, and you will pay for that; if you don't want to be hungry after, minimum 2 dishes per person, as the portions are extremely small. It's that or you will get a snack elsewhere after going there."
ChIJm3JJX_opQg0RX7sg7xZzKSE,5,"I love this place! I‚Äôve been here about 5 times and will definitely come back again. We were served by Angel Valbuena and he is great! He speaks un poco english so it was better for me! Food is great, atmosphere is great and service is great!"
ChIJm3JJX_opQg0RX7sg7xZzKSE,5,"The restaurant is very spacious and they offer both indoor and outdoor balcony seating. The interior design is very creative and makes you feel like you are really traveling.

All the staff was very friendly and offer good advice on what to order. They also introduced the contents of each dish when they served it.

I ordered two half entrees and one main course; the portions were very generous and tasty. I especially liked their Abanico de cerdo ib√©rico, which was grilled and seasoned properly and had a smooth texture in the mouth.

It's a great place to get together with family or friends, and the seating area inside has a lot of separation so you can have more privacy."
ChIJJcK3wWooQg0RRmBVUqq5L5k,4,"Good pizza , good beer and nice staff , 9‚Ç¨ for a pizza with multiple toppings"
ChIJJcK3wWooQg0RRmBVUqq5L5k,2,"The waitress who served us was very friendly and did everything possible with the situation, since she seemed to be alone taking all the tables, but the food took almost an hour to come out and they told us that it was because there was only one person in the kitchen. Clearly it is not the employees' fault, but it is almost better to notify them of the situation in order to avoid long waits and manage expectations.
The food tasted ok, but the portions were quite small for the price and the wait.
Again, emphasize that we understand that it is not the fault of the employees, who also treated us correctly."
ChIJJcK3wWooQg0RRmBVUqq5L5k,1,"The smallest portions I have ever been served at the highest price
I do not recommend
Example photo 15 euros a ""ration"""
ChIJJcK3wWooQg0RRmBVUqq5L5k,5,"Price quality much better than in the center. Quiet, clean and incredibly friendly staff. Especially the waitress from Latin America.
The quality/price ratio is much better than in the center. Quiet, clean and the staff incredibly friendly. Especially the waitress from Latin America."

ChIJ72g--VQpQg0RTaG3i2Ev2VQ,1,HORRIBLE
ChIJ72g--VQpQg0RTaG3i2Ev2VQ,5,"Magnificent Asturian gluten-free meals. What you order, they prepare it for you and you take it warm. The ham or cured meat cachopos, croquettes, fabada, eggplant lasagna, rice pudding, etc. are very good.
Very attentive and very good dishes.
Thanks for thinking gluten free"
ChIJ72g--VQpQg0RTaG3i2Ev2VQ,4,"Muy bueno. Restaurante asturiano con todo sin gluten. Es maravilloso que piensen en los celiacos. Todo sin frutos secos excepto postres. Solo admite take-away, no se puede comer dentro. Adem√°s cerca de una pasteler√≠a con todo sin gluten tambi√©n. Estar√≠a bien que abriesen un espacio para comer dentro o en la terraza."
ChIJ72g--VQpQg0RTaG3i2Ev2VQ,5,"Asturian excellence. All exquisite, with top quality raw materials and wonderful home cooking. And absolutely everything gluten-free. The cheesecake is amazing, although the brownie, rice pudding and apple pie are also from another planet. And as for main dishes and side dishes... what to say! Cachopos, croquettes, fabadas, pots, various stews (which are more delicious), meatballs, scorpionfish cake, Russian salad, chicken nuggets, flamenquines, some championship potatoes with onions... We have tried practically everything and we have loved EVERYTHING. Plus, Pepa and her team are a sweetheart. Personalized customer service and 100% Asturian friendliness. A dream come true in the Arg√ºelles neighborhood."
ChIJ72g--VQpQg0RTaG3i2Ev2VQ,5,"It's nice that having to eat away from home doesn't mean eating badly, it's like eating at grandma's house.
Magnificent establishment. Wide variety of takeaway dishes. The ones I've tried so far are all very good, and at a great price.
Whatever you ask for, it is a success.
Variety, quality, friendliness and super good price.
The best takeaway place.
And let's not talk about the desserts, they have the best cheesecake üòç
I recommend üíØ%"
ChIJn_xJ0GsoQg0R9qVgpRoL_lE,5,"As a person who visited Italia many times, that is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The service was great and the food was delicious ü•∞"
ChIJn_xJ0GsoQg0R9qVgpRoL_lE,5,"This is one of our favourite Italian restaurants in the city (and let's be honest, there are lots to choose from!). It's small and cozy (make a reservation), the owner is super friendly, everything we've tried has been delicious and above all, their tortelloni is to die for."
ChIJn_xJ0GsoQg0R9qVgpRoL_lE,5,Delicious food and wonderful hospitality. Many of the guests are regulars for a reason.
ChIJn_xJ0GsoQg0R9qVgpRoL_lE,5,Superb!! We found this by accident. It has a wonderful atmosphere and quaint set up. Its traditional and warm. The service was quick and they made a dish without meat for one of our group especially. We also were really awkward about wine  choices and they were so calm and helpful. A gem! Will return
ChIJn_xJ0GsoQg0R9qVgpRoL_lE,3,"Food in this restaurant is above standard Italians in Madrid. You will find good old spaghetti vongole, carbonara, pesto, melanzana parmesana, burrata, pizza... But the quality and taste is clearly above the others. Pizzas are quite good and desserts interesting.

We tried carpaccio of ternera, some pasta and some pizza, carpaccio ans calzone pizza were good. For dessert I recommend panettone with chocolate and tiramisu.

You will have here above average lunch/dinner at above average price. Is a good italian option that you can keep in mind for next capriccio italiano"
ChIJv1g3CGsoQg0RaPH69b-Z1zs,5,"What a great restaurant. Every dish was tasty, great and fast service.  Food was coming in a continuesly."

ChIJv1g3CGsoQg0RaPH69b-Z1zs,5,"We had delicious scrambled eggs, a very generous portion and quite inexpensive, great experience overall!"
ChIJv1g3CGsoQg0RaPH69b-Z1zs,2,Not friendly at all and a bit expensive for 2 sodas

ChIJn87a4m8pQg0R6AbMa-uBNdM,5,
ChIJtyzAzWsoQg0RreC-24lvD-k,4,Overall good. Place need a refurbishment but food and prices are quite fair.
ChIJtyzAzWsoQg0RreC-24lvD-k,1,"The worst bar I've ever been to. The drink is expensive and they serve it in cans and without any appetizers. But the rations thing is already regrettable. We ordered some chicken fingers and for ‚Ç¨12 (very expensive in itself, one would expect something very good) they brought us the La Cocinera brand, literally the ones we bought in the supermarket... The potatoes were also frozen and were empty inside. A robbery, basically. Any other bar in Madrid is a better and cheaper option. Don't go."
ChIJtyzAzWsoQg0RreC-24lvD-k,4,"Bar bueno para tomar algo tranquilamente. Nos atendieron genial el matrimonio que lo lleva. Nos puso dos tapas, una de patatas con salsas y unas aceitunas."
ChIJtyzAzWsoQg0RreC-24lvD-k,2,It's fine to have something as an aperitif. But the portions are a joke. We ordered some scrambled eggs with HAM and this is what they brought us. A dish with overcooked eggs with hard yolks and broken ones and 4 tiny pieces of ham among them oily bacon with the same frozen fries that serve as an appetizer. There is nowhere to save it and too expensive for what it was (‚Ç¨9).
ChIJtyzAzWsoQg0RreC-24lvD-k,4,"We were having some beers and they gave us a large tray of potatoes with sauces as an appetizer.
Reasonable price and good service"
ChIJL1jdgH0pQg0Rs0NmDLJMBT8,3,"Hip spot for some drinks and, to be fair, good prices and great service. I would simply avoid the food. It's like going back in time before anyone knew how to cook. Iceberg lettuce salads, deep fried everything with mayo ketchup sauce. Might as well eat Puerto Rican food."
ChIJL1jdgH0pQg0Rs0NmDLJMBT8,5,Great service. Friendly environment enjoyed with children. Tasty food with extra tapas with drinks.
ChIJL1jdgH0pQg0Rs0NmDLJMBT8,5,"Friendly staff, great food, all at reasonable prices, no wonder the police report here for lunch!"
ChIJL1jdgH0pQg0Rs0NmDLJMBT8,5,"Very good service, with well-prepared dishes balanced in flavor, textures and fats. Good place to have a coffee with a good location in Madrid, except that it is in front of a very unpleasant political center and its leaders generate a bad atmosphere.
This bar is a good refuge."
ChIJL1jdgH0pQg0Rs0NmDLJMBT8,5,"Ferraz 39, the heart of Ferraz!!!
Cozy bar, with two exceptional waitresses, who go out of their way to serve their customers.
The food is very good, and the atmosphere is unbeatable, you just have to stop by at any time of the day and you will see how it is always full."
ChIJ0XJqh2soQg0R5Ir_yp9KUXM,2,"Poor food, pricey.

Ordered scrambled eggs on toast (6.5‚Ç¨) and breakfast tea (‚Ç¨3). Got chai tea, bizarrely with hot milk; and a bread roll with a cut up unseasoned omelette.

Service was slow - had to go in each time.

Orange juice (4.7‚Ç¨) was fresh and good.

Overall Expensive and not worth it."
ChIJ0XJqh2soQg0R5Ir_yp9KUXM,5,"Delicious food and great service! We loved sitting at their outdoor seating. Servers are helpful and friendly. Excellent sangria and raddler on tap! Daily items, tapas and a full menu. We found the prices to match to food quality. Wifi available. Highly recommend!"
ChIJ0XJqh2soQg0R5Ir_yp9KUXM,5,"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. The terraza was full and lively at lunch hour (2-3pm) but food still came out in a timely manner. Recommend!"
ChIJ0XJqh2soQg0R5Ir_yp9KUXM,5,"This terrific street-side restaurant is one of host of similar businesses in the area, but is so worth the experience.
Staff were friendly and engaging while menu was a good length with plenty of options to meet most palates.
Good prices capped off a wonderful night."

ChIJSera_wgpQg0R2-BLwVwqE3o,5,"We had a fabulous lunch this afternoon as well as yesterday, the Menu of the Day is an absolute bargain. Service was friendly and professional. In particular, Omar was outstanding. The food was delicious and when we return to Madrid we will be coming back."
ChIJSera_wgpQg0R2-BLwVwqE3o,5,This restaurant is reliable and consistent. Quality to price ratio is high.  Their food it well done and the service is friendly as well as professional. I keep coming back because they are always happy to do their best every visit.
ChIJSera_wgpQg0R2-BLwVwqE3o,5,Did. It expect this to be as good as it was! They even delivered
ChIJSera_wgpQg0R2-BLwVwqE3o,5,Wonderful restaurant with delicious fish and seafood! The staff are friendly and welcoming - excellent service. I would highly recommend a visit!
ChIJSera_wgpQg0R2-BLwVwqE3o,1,"This restaurant was the biggest disappointment during our holiday in Madrid. The staff were really very nice, but they don't speak English at all and the English menu didn't match the Spanish one, so it took us quite a while to order what we wanted. The meals were really average to below average, the portions were small. Cod was raw, steak was rare (they didn't ask how to cook it at all), schrimps were swimming in 3 quarts of butter. Since no one stopped by while we were eating, we didn't even have a chance to complain about the food, and given the language barrier, we wouldn't have gotten much out of it anyway. We left 100‚Ç¨ lighter and hungry."
ChIJSfsOu2soQg0R8w9rtlCGeHg,5,Excellent service and food. I had steak and spaghetti. Lunch was very reasonably priced. Will visit again.
ChIJSfsOu2soQg0R8w9rtlCGeHg,4,"The staff were very kind and lovely and tried their best even without any knowledge of English.
The food was good, the prices were much affordable, and it was tasty and relatively cheap.
The steak was rear, and I didn't like that they didn't ask how I wanted it (well, at least).
But overall it was very good. 4/5."
ChIJSfsOu2soQg0R8w9rtlCGeHg,5,Small place but really good service and great food! Ask for recommendations!
ChIJSfsOu2soQg0R8w9rtlCGeHg,5,"Great food and services! I ate ""chips de berenjena"" and those were amazing. Also I recommend  ""solomillo iberico"".

Certainty, I will return.

PS. Tapas were tasty."
ChIJSfsOu2soQg0R8w9rtlCGeHg,5,"I had the cheese salad; it was amazing! Good portion, great flavour. Staff was very nice. I recommend this small restaurant!"
ChIJexzzoKgpQg0RjOl0eFXviME,5,"An enchanting place, great atmosphere but overall the nicest and most professional personal. They offer a wide variety of high quality dishes. The appetizer was fantastic and the meal couldn‚Äôt have been better! We‚Äôll be back for sure."
ChIJexzzoKgpQg0RjOl0eFXviME,5,"Delicious food, nice ambience and friendly staff. Just ordered the starters but they were quite convincing."
ChIJexzzoKgpQg0RjOl0eFXviME,5,"Lovely place. Great food, amazing staff and chill environment."
ChIJexzzoKgpQg0RjOl0eFXviME,5,Best risotto in my life!! I didn‚Äôt know rice can taste like that. Incredible. Highly recommend.
ChIJexzzoKgpQg0RjOl0eFXviME,5,Excellent service and the food was delicious. The atmosphere was delightful.

ChIJD9IBxsIpQg0RsNhR0M_3N6w,5,
ChIJq21vezkpQg0RZhZ9bxe2jHQ,3,"The food was good, the place is very homemade. The saut√©ed loin is the only drawback I have, the meat is very tough, the polloda huanca√≠na was delicious and the pisco was too expensive for how small the glass is.
The atmosphere of the place is Peruvian, which means that it is probably a good place for real Peruvian food. But they must improve the smoke outlet, I came out smelling of different odors.
The bathroom could also be checked from time to time as it was quite dirty.
I highlight the friendliness of the waitress, and the truth is that the place makes you feel like you have traveled thousands of kilometers, it is very authentic"
ChIJq21vezkpQg0RZhZ9bxe2jHQ,3,"Honestly, the marine trio is so simple, the fish was very parboiled, the rice didn't have any seafood, it seems like they just painted it and that's it, the chicharr√≥n was chewy, it needed to be fried more because the dough also came out. It's a trio like someone prepares at home but doesn't know how to cook and tries. Doesn't make me want to go back. We should give another dish a chance."
ChIJq21vezkpQg0RZhZ9bxe2jHQ,5,"We were in Arg√ºelles and didn't know where to have a bite to eat but we found this place and we really liked it. We tried Anticuchos, Tamal, Lomo Saltado and Arroz Chaufa. Passion fruit juice was also on the Menu. All delicious and incredible quality and price. The site is not big but everything is very well organized and they were very friendly. So every time we go through that area we will return without hesitation."
ChIJq21vezkpQg0RZhZ9bxe2jHQ,5,"The place is quite cozy, the staff friendly. I ordered a marine trio and it was delicious. I recommend it 100%"
ChIJq21vezkpQg0RZhZ9bxe2jHQ,5,"Delicious, the experience was worth it, the food was super delicious, the best ceviche in Madrid and the rice with seafood, needless to say, very friendly guys... I wish the place was bigger but after that everything üíØüíØ"
ChIJdy-iw_EpQg0R1FLA7dmYVWc,5,"We had an absolutely incredible meal here last week! Albert was such an amazing server and when we weren't sure what was best to order he gave us the best recommendations. Our meal was terrific with the pineapple fish being the star of the show! We also had margaritas of various flavours which were delicious also! Thanks for an amazing evening, we will will certainly be back soon!"
ChIJdy-iw_EpQg0R1FLA7dmYVWc,5,We went here to celebrate my friend‚Äôs birthday and she said it tasted exactly like home. The quality of the food was amazing and the service was the best. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food and an overall great experience. Will definitely bring more friends and family here. 5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
ChIJdy-iw_EpQg0R1FLA7dmYVWc,5,"We came across this place for dinner tonight and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing with incredible flavours - you could tell the food is cooked from the heart, the atmosphere and setting was nice and the service was amazing. We had a lovely man serving us and looking after us the entire night, explaining the menu to us and he was so patient with us. It was nice to finally be able to communicate in English with a waiter in Madrid! The owner was so lovely to us too. Would highly recommend this place for food, service and atmosphere!"
ChIJdy-iw_EpQg0R1FLA7dmYVWc,5,Our favourite Mexican restaurant in Madrid. Everything is always great and the staff is super friendly! Miguel was our server/bartender and he was incredibly professional üçª

ChIJQ6Uhd2QpQg0R9KPFD6N6uPE,4,"Nice place with pleasure stuff. Cakes was good and taste well. It was very sweet but wasn‚Äôt in first place. However stuff don‚Äôt speak English‚Ä¶ so if you don‚Äôt have translator or you don‚Äôt like speak ‚Äú I‚Äôll show what I want ‚Äú you will be in a little problem.
In the end I want tell you : If you like a sweet and taste good cakes you‚Äôll come here and order something."

ChIJsbWHcWwoQg0RuEh1Lmp65_0,5,"I was recently having coffee with a friend. The truth is that the treatment was great and the coffee was very delicious. It didn't seem very expensive to me if we take into account the area in which the bar is located. They have a huge terrace, so in good weather it's great to go have a drink or a soft drink there.
The problem is parking, the parking is in a green or blue zone and the truth is that it is difficult to find a place, especially if it is a weekend."
ChIJsbWHcWwoQg0RuEh1Lmp65_0,1,"Very Poor Organization of Both Kitchen and Living Room.
I think the menu of the day is not bad. Of course, we will never hold a celebration there again. We had an agreed menu of 4 starters and a main course to choose from meat or fish. I couldn't count the millions of mistakes that occurred in a simple family meal. We spent almost 2 hours with some starters to share, and, until we finished the penultimate one, they didn't ask us about the second one, so we waited another 30 minutes until the second one arrived. It took so long that I had finished my plate and whoever was in front of me still didn't have it... They had to put it TO GO. They began to remove wine glasses and water glasses alike and the NAPKINS, BEFORE BRINGING THE DESSERT.
By the time they brought the coffee it was time for snack.
I think they should dedicate themselves to another type of service that is not at the table."
ChIJsbWHcWwoQg0RuEh1Lmp65_0,1,"We rented this place to celebrate our graduation and it probably couldn't have been more horrible. To begin with, our reservation was from 11:30 p.m. to 5:00 a.m., for which they required us to be at least 90. Well, those 90 people were waiting until practically 1 in the morning to be able to enter, finding the panorama that, for the price we had paid, there were not enough people to serve us, two bathrooms were closed and the other two were damaged, clogged, they were disgusting just to see them, they smelled horrible, and they ended up overflowing and flooding the ground (which is why we had to end up going outside, improving the situation). To make matters worse, it turned out that the place only had a license until 2 in the morning, so they had to vacate, leaving us all on the street at 3:30 in the morning.
I don't recommend it in the least, they are scammers."
ChIJsbWHcWwoQg0RuEh1Lmp65_0,1,"The place is very cozy and the terrace is very good, the service couldn't be worse, call us to reserve and they had no record, we asked what wines they had and they directly served us one without knowing what it was, a disaster, the food is worth it"
ChIJsbWHcWwoQg0RuEh1Lmp65_0,4,"A good terrace to have a drink.
I was in the area, and I arrived here after visiting the Moncloa Lighthouse.
Parking is easy and the service is very pleasant.
They give you some olives and fries which is appreciated. We had a couple of beers.
I did not enter the premises. The terrace chairs are very comfortable.
A good place, yes. I will return."

ChIJz0maWwApQg0R59xnaaTVJAw,1,"The meat was tasteless, the nachos came only with cheese without the carnitas and beans and despite telling us about it, they charged us for them as if they included everything (18 euros!). We have gone several times to the other one they have and it is better but this time both the quantity and the quality stood out for their non-existence. In 250 grams of birria, 4 chunks of dubious quality came to us. When we told them about it, they confirmed that they were the skin-guts with which they are made, something that we had never found in any Mexican on a plate. In short, disappointing and I would not recommend it until they match the quality of Rodr√≠guez San Pedro."
ChIJz0maWwApQg0R59xnaaTVJAw,4,"A quiet and very pleasant place, great service, Paco makes you feel at home!
I had never tried ‚ÄúBirria‚Äù in any Mexican I have been to and I was amazed, they make it spectacular! ‚Ä¶one of my favorite dishes from now on‚Ä¶
They make their tortilla chips and tortillas, you can tell they are homemade..
And the margarita, so far the best I've tried... on this occasion 2x1
On weekends you can find mariachis singing during your lunch or dinner (they will return in September)
I loved it and it will surely be one of the Mexicans I choose from now on! I recommend it to you üá≤üáΩüåÆ"
ChIJz0maWwApQg0R59xnaaTVJAw,1,"It has been my worst experience in a place in Madrid. I went with two friends to this restaurant that supposedly serves Mexican food, since we really like the food of that country. We met some waiters who were drunk, one fell to the floor. We complained about the treatment they were giving us and the ""manager"" came who looked worse than the waiters and had a white nose.

In 30 minutes they gave us nothing but the drink and the food we ordered was cold and tasteless.

I don't recommend it. Please refrain from coming here. We left feeling mistreated."
ChIJd1tYbq0pQg0RvNTDEuIQ2Jo,5,"Where should I start? Let‚Äôs start by saying this is a gem. Right in the hustle and bustle of one of Madrid‚Äôs most visited park, Templo de Debod. Pi√∫ Di Prima is here to impress you with its decor, great service and magnificent food. We ordered the burrata, carpaccio & melanzanne parmigiana and it was superb. The drinks were amazing and dessert was the cherry on the cake. What a beautiful place! We will be back."
ChIJd1tYbq0pQg0RvNTDEuIQ2Jo,3,Too much garlic!!! Into a very smal portion. Penne Arabiata  .....
ChIJd1tYbq0pQg0RvNTDEuIQ2Jo,5,"Came in for a late dinner. Very friendly staff. My wife had a lovely squid spaghetti which she loved. I come from Toronto, where I think there are more Italian restaurants per square mile than anywhere in the world, expect perhaps for Italy! So, I've eaten a lot of Italian food. Had one of the best pizza capricciosa I've eaten in a long time. The house wine was a montpelucciano d' Abruzzo. Delish. I don't usually go to non Spanish restaurants in Spain, but I'm going back to this place!"
ChIJd1tYbq0pQg0RvNTDEuIQ2Jo,5,A lactose intolerant cannot live happily‚Äã in this world after knowing the Burrata they serve in here. Is amazing. And the risoto! One of the best things I've had in Madrid.
ChIJd1tYbq0pQg0RvNTDEuIQ2Jo,4,"Carpaccio and antipasti were great, also great service and beautiful place"
ChIJGx1z5X0pQg0RwkhRq27AS9Y,5,"Excellent new restaurant in the neighbourhood. Food is fresh and very tasty, service is good and i like the large glass windows that let in a lot of natural light. Will visit again."
ChIJGx1z5X0pQg0RwkhRq27AS9Y,5,"I‚Äôve eaten Peruvian food all around the world and have to say that Kausa definitely lives up (and maybe even exceeds) the standard. I had food from the ‚ÄòMenu del Dia‚Äô option and was blown away by the presentation and flavors that each plate offered‚Äîincluding my favorite addition, a homemade ‚Äòolive‚Äô sauce that accompanies the pollo a la brasa plate. SO good. Ricardo‚Äôs service was also the cherry on top to my experience. Will definitely be returning!"
ChIJGx1z5X0pQg0RwkhRq27AS9Y,5,"Very great atm√≥sfera,good service and delicious food!"
ChIJGx1z5X0pQg0RwkhRq27AS9Y,5,Great food and great service every time
ChIJGx1z5X0pQg0RwkhRq27AS9Y,5,"We found this place by chance. Great Peruvian food! We tried  ceviche, tuna tataki, pap√°s a la huancaina and anticuchos‚Ä¶ everything was better than expected!!! Jairo gave us great recommendations."
ChIJIeD8O7wpQg0REO3v3GYSV_s,5,"Very cozy, small cafe with an efficient layout that encouraged staff to be welcoming towards customers.
After leaving, I realised I had left  a small bag hanging on a chair. The bag contained three valuable camera lenses. My wife walked back and the staff had found the bag and put it in a drawer behind their service counter.
Their honesty and professionalism shows why they have such a well run business.
Thank you."
ChIJIeD8O7wpQg0REO3v3GYSV_s,5,Very delicious coffee and pan. Gracias.
ChIJIeD8O7wpQg0REO3v3GYSV_s,5,"Nice downtown spot for a quick afternoon cafe and some pastries
Well located good ambience and they have wifi so you can work
Good service and quiet"
ChIJIeD8O7wpQg0REO3v3GYSV_s,1,"Average breakfast, the service was absolutely terrible.
Asked for two brunches, both orders
I order a flaut√≠n (thin baguette with smashed tomatoes and jam√≥n), it came without tomato. I asked them to bring me some as it was missing, the waitress insisted there is no tomato in the sandwich I ordered. I had to get her to read the menu to prove her wrong! Yet, she didn't apologize and left in a very arrogant way. My girlfriend ordered one with basil, for it to come without any. When asking for some the waitress replied they didn't have any. We told her they should have told us when we ordered, for her only to blame her colleague who took the order. Still no excuse. Absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional.
I will not be back and will definitely NOT recommend this place to anyone."
ChIJIeD8O7wpQg0REO3v3GYSV_s,5,Lovely welcoming staff and delicious food too. Very clean and have baby high chairs which appear rare in these establishments. Best cafe we've been too on our visit to Madrid.
ChIJVWUra2koQg0RibasFlk1R24,5,One of my favorite meals during my week-long stay in Spain. The food was amazing and the Mahou beer was refreshing. The place is very pretty so it‚Äôs a lovely setting while you enjoy your meal. I highly recommend and will definitely return during my next visit to Madrid.
ChIJVWUra2koQg0RibasFlk1R24,2,"The staff doesn‚Äôt speak English and seems frustrated and tense due to the communication barrier.

The croquettes were good, but the potatoes next to the octopus were cold. The ravioli was nice, but it may not appeal to everyone."
ChIJVWUra2koQg0RibasFlk1R24,3,"The staff doesn‚Äôt speak English and seems frustrated and tense due to the communication barrier.

The croquettes were good, but the potatoes next to the octopus were cold. The ravioli was nice, but it may not appeal to everyone."
ChIJVWUra2koQg0RibasFlk1R24,4,"Good. Easy 4-stars.  Nice balance between food quality, price, service, and location.  It was quiet when we arrived (with no reservation), but soon filled up.

Staff were attentive and nice

The menu was quite varied, and there were good options to cater to most tastes.  Nice.starts and desert options too.

We ordered two main dishes and it was enough, we didn't want more.  Bread and olives were added to the table so we did also pick at these.

I had cannelloni with raro de Toro (generous and tasty). My partner had a rice dish with seafood.  Both delicious

The restaurant is very nice inside, with comfy seats and nice decor..

One small thing we didn't like.  It was maybe 20 degrees outside and they had the air-con on strong. We asked and were told It was actually heating! And would warm up soon.. it didn't so we put our jackets on :(

But apart from that good food and nice place."
ChIJVWUra2koQg0RibasFlk1R24,4,"A beautifully designed restaurant. The waiters are very kind and nice. The food is varied and fresh.
I ate Artichoke and hummus which were very tasty and a wonderful and delicate salmon dish. The place is very noisy and a bit dark ü§®"
ChIJqcqA3GgoQg0R69QLZG1bW-g,5,"Loved this restaurant. So romantic and beautiful. Fantastic table service. Very well done! Immediately we were served some cheese, crackers, and a warm cream of artichoke soup in a little glass. So much flavor. We were also given a choice of brown or white bread from a basket. The artichoke appetizer was unique and incredibly delicious. I wish I had the recipe. One is enough to share for two people. You must order this. We also shared the croquettes, which were perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside and creamy and flavorful on the inside. My one critique is with the squid in ink. The squid themselves were perfectly cooked and the rice was starchy and amazing, but they didn‚Äôt say they were stuffed. I‚Äôm used to Italian stuffed squid with bread crumbs and tentacles. I couldn‚Äôt tell what these were stuffed with and the taste of onion overwhelmed and ruined the dish for me. I would have preferred them unstuffed. I also didn‚Äôt care for the squid ink sauce which seemed like it had too much flour or cornstarch or some kind of thickener. It wasn‚Äôt natural looking or tasting. I would go back and order something else, perhaps the creamy rice with lobster which is a specialty of the house. We were too full for dessert, but the server gave us each two wrapped pieces of chocolate. Everything on the other tables looked amazing too. Reservations are recommended but not required."
ChIJqcqA3GgoQg0R69QLZG1bW-g,4,Food was good. Service was really good. A bit on the high $ on price.
ChIJqcqA3GgoQg0R69QLZG1bW-g,5,"Very good place for good diner after long travel‚Ä¶..you need to have good meal‚Ä¶.. we were lucky to find this place recommend by our Fraind who live in Madrid‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ we had super good meal‚Ä¶. Service by staff was awesome‚Ä¶.. best artichokes and some others but we took Artitacture‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Highly recommend who come to Madrid"
ChIJqcqA3GgoQg0R69QLZG1bW-g,5,"Highly recommend! Great service, nice food and wine. The price is reasonable."
ChIJqcqA3GgoQg0R69QLZG1bW-g,5,"This slow-roasted Piquillo pepper, peeled, soaked in olive oil, rolled up the tuna belly and eaten, the smooth and delicate flavor of the fruit pepper is so beautiful.

Iberian specialty octopus skewers, crispy and fragrant, paired with creamy sweet potato mash, superb.

The garlic shrimp I think it is easier to make at home. Shell the fresh shrimp and fry both sides, then put olive oil and vinegar in the stew pot, add garlic slices to saut√©, and then pour in txakoli wine, this wine is slightly bubbly and belongs to a very dry white wine. Finally, remember to put the shrimp back in and stew it.
When serving, the hot oil sizzles, accompanied by a very strong sense of freshness and chewiness, which is wonderful."
ChIJ1aUJ_mkoQg0RqNUVl66qk1c,5,"Food was delicious, all what we order was very good,
but what it made it really special was the service. The lady, i think called Leire, made it perfect really welcoming and efficient!"
ChIJ1aUJ_mkoQg0RqNUVl66qk1c,5,"First and foremost Melody the waitress is amazing, the best 100%. Gema is also very patient considering the challenge that some Customers are.
Food a 10, I highly recommend Manolos because everything was awesome , tasty delicious and amazing. We had some tapas like the croquettes, endaladilla rusa and the brie cheese and wow great. We shared the main course sime ribs which were spectacular and cheesecake for dessert.
The Arzzuaga wine was as expected perfect match. Well priced and good traditional spanish food that never fails I am not surprised it has been open since 1934. Make sure you reserve."
ChIJ1aUJ_mkoQg0RqNUVl66qk1c,5,Very nice place with traditional food and great service!
ChIJ1aUJ_mkoQg0RqNUVl66qk1c,4,"Good food, big quantity and not so expensive. Good atmosphere in a relaxing place. Good service."
ChIJ1aUJ_mkoQg0RqNUVl66qk1c,5,Fantastic bar/restaurant in Moncloa/Arguelles area of Madrid. The food is amazing and the staff are very welcoming. They have a section through the bar for fine dining if you want to eat and drink in lovely surroundings.
ChIJ2RH4I2goQg0RX9LKJpvcYdU,5,"We are so glad we made a stop here. Recommended by a few friends. Service and food was perfect here. Highly recommend for sure. Family friendly. Small dining space inside but still very comfortable. Lots of historical Spain pictures, paintings and articles around the walls which were beautiful. The waiter/host was so attentive and extremely polite made the experience even more better."
ChIJ2RH4I2goQg0RX9LKJpvcYdU,5,"If you're looking for an authentic experience in the heart of Chamber√≠, look no further than this gem of a restaurant-bar. We've recently discovered it, and it has quickly become one of our favorite spots to visit. The moment you step inside, you're immersed in a unique bullfighting atmosphere that gives the place a true Spanish character.

The tapas here are absolutely fantastic, each dish bursting with flavor and clearly made with care. Whether you're a local or just visiting, the selection offers something for everyone. The service is another highlight‚Äîthe staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, making you feel right at home from the moment you walk in.

It's refreshing to have a new bar that adds so much charm and character to our list of go-to places. If you enjoy great food, excellent service, and a memorable ambiance, we highly recommend paying this place a visit. It's a wonderful addition to the Chamber√≠ scene!"
ChIJ2RH4I2goQg0RX9LKJpvcYdU,4,"Great tapas bar with real food and great quality, we loved the artichokes that are a must, the broken eggs are good but could be better as well as chicken pincho. The service, wine and place is excellent to return"
ChIJ2RH4I2goQg0RX9LKJpvcYdU,5,Amazing place ! Worth it ;) it was a great surprise !
ChIJ2RH4I2goQg0RX9LKJpvcYdU,2,"Service is good and it looks cute inside, but 15,50 for 6 slices of fried eggplant with honey and  (no clue why) garlic sauce was absolutely not worth it. Cannot understand the garlic sauce addition at all, really ruined the plate. Without it it was okay but still way too expensive for what it is."
ChIJU9-luLYpQg0RP5Y1d4iC10c,5,"Excellent overall experience. Madrid is a very walkable city, and the location of the hotel made sightseeing very easy.

Our luggage was not on our plane. The airline delivered our bags to the hotel, and the hotel staff took care of everything for us.

Bonus: Fantastic brekfast and pastry shops exactly next door to the hotel.

Walking distance from my us stop and metro access points.

Would easily stay here again. Loved it!"
ChIJU9-luLYpQg0RP5Y1d4iC10c,5,"Fantastic hotel and located a short distance from great sight seeing spots.

Rooms were fantastic and they were very clean and spacious. Also very modern.

Staff were very helpful and friendly."
ChIJU9-luLYpQg0RP5Y1d4iC10c,3,"The walls are paper thin you can hear EVERYTHING (and I mean everything). It‚Äôs okay, the rooms are clean and well maintained. We got a double bed but it‚Äôs literally two beds pushed together and one of the beds has wheels so it‚Äôs like you‚Äôd sink into a hole in the middle of the bed ha. Breakfast  is okay 5/10 but fresh. If you‚Äôre looking for somewhere clean to sleep and close by to everything, it‚Äôs a good deal. Other than that if you want to sleep well I‚Äôd say go elsewhere."
ChIJU9-luLYpQg0RP5Y1d4iC10c,1,"First of all, I like the entire Leonardo hotel network. It‚Äôs usually cozy, good service, location and nice breakfast.

It‚Äôs pretty much the same in this hotel. Except one thing - rooms have a terrible soundproof. I was clearly able to hear (and understand!) the normal voice communications in neighbor rooms, even snoring. I felt like I stayed in a dormitory.

Of course the reception personnel weren‚Äôt able to help as they cannot reconstruct the building.

Don‚Äôt visit here unless you have earbuds or ability to sleep in all noisy conditions."
ChIJU9-luLYpQg0RP5Y1d4iC10c,5,"I would like to express how happy I was with the Leonardo Hotel City , Madrid, Spain. The front desk agents were very nice. My room was very clean, with fresh sheets and towels along with a fully stocked coffeemaker area. I had a nice view of the city, with its beautiful Architectural buildings. The housekeeping staff we‚Äôre accommodating with extras, such as sugar, milk, extra towels, etc. The lead housekeeper that day was Sonia and another lady working with her were very pleasant and extremely helpful.
I‚Äôd like to also add big shout out to Nickolas one of the front desk host. I called him two times to come to my room to help me turn on the shower properly and then again coffee/tea pot. I also had to approach him several times about which way to find a breakfast or dinner spot and the way to find the train. I am a retired flight attendant from American Airlines. I usually know my way around a hotel and in different cities. But it‚Äôs been some time since I stayed in Madrid and I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better place to stay or Front Dest attendant like Nickolas for help. So thank you Nickolas (hope spelling is correct) for making my stay in Madrid, a happy one."
ChIJiRd9KWQoQg0RaBHT_ophfyM,5,Delicious foods. Local visitors. Good team.
ChIJiRd9KWQoQg0RaBHT_ophfyM,5,"Everything you want in a tapas bar!  Good beer, great tapas and friendly service. My favorite is the lacon(ham), dusted with paprika and drizzled with olive oil. The croquetas are also amazing. This is slightly off the beaten path between Plaza de Espa√±a and central Malasa√±a. Also nice to explore a little away from the crowds of Madrid and find great little places like this."
ChIJiRd9KWQoQg0RaBHT_ophfyM,1,"The waiters took away the food before I would have finished it. I am not sure about in Spain, but other countries it would have been an offense. And why I would give them a tip after this lousy behavior? The food was quite mediocre here."
ChIJiRd9KWQoQg0RaBHT_ophfyM,4,I always come here for the steak entrecote because it is nicely grilled on the charcoal.. a la parilla..  with a great bbq taste..
ChIJiRd9KWQoQg0RaBHT_ophfyM,4,Great neighborhood bar. Friendly staff and each round of beers comes with a order of tapas included
ChIJJ7xpiWgoQg0RM9gDwVr0CYw,5,"They have a simple menu with no photos and a basic list of dishes such as soups, salads, rices, alcohol, seafoods, and starters in Spanish, English, and Japanese but you can also personally go up to the staff and get coffee or dessert of some sort. The prices are decent especially for the service and enviornment as well.

I had gotten the ‚ÄòWarm salad with seallop and king prawns‚Äô alongside ‚ÄòPaella mariscos‚Äô which were both nicely portioned and tasted pretty good. The waitress also asked ahead of time if we wanted the paella to be cut in thirds before serving us. They also bring you bread ahead of time but it‚Äôs ‚Ç¨6.60. Overall, it was a nice experience and I recommend the place especially if you‚Äôre a tourist."
ChIJJ7xpiWgoQg0RM9gDwVr0CYw,5,Two of us ordered two starters and the beef for 2. Very satisfied after the meal. The soup was the bit salty though but I like it overall.
ChIJJ7xpiWgoQg0RM9gDwVr0CYw,5,"They are so nice!!! I only came to have a glass of wine or two and they kept giving me complimentary food!!! I was trying to save my appetite for dinner but I felt so bad to put the tortilla to waste! They gave me patatas bravas, tortillas and olives for just two glasses of wine! I would love to go back here and chill again."
ChIJJ7xpiWgoQg0RM9gDwVr0CYw,4,"Good seafood! Soup is so tasty. Sangria is a bit with gas and so good.
Paella is so good! Only the position is really huge for me..."
ChIJJ7xpiWgoQg0RM9gDwVr0CYw,5,I loved the zamburi√±as! The atmosphere was really welcoming. Thank you for the good service
ChIJfUO_HGooQg0Rg0aa7WkB15A,5,Great service and delicious food. We really enjoyed the verduras plancha!
ChIJfUO_HGooQg0Rg0aa7WkB15A,4,Typical bar for drinks and tapas
ChIJfUO_HGooQg0Rg0aa7WkB15A,4,"Simple, local and friendly. Served us food and drink at gone midnight on a Sunday. Threw in some free stuff too. Overall good."
ChIJfUO_HGooQg0Rg0aa7WkB15A,5,Great breakfast! Reccomend it for churros and chocolate.
ChIJfUO_HGooQg0Rg0aa7WkB15A,3,"We went for breakfast, the size and appearance of the portions were very good but for my taste the flavors were a bit strong (I ordered a bread with tomato and a coffee). The waiter was quite sparse in his words, I don't know if he was having a bad day."
ChIJR8ezkGUoQg0RLDuOQWgo0EM,5,"love!!!! the food is so flavorful and the meat is so tender. they require each guest to spend at least 27‚Ç¨, which isn't difficult since the portions are pretty small. expensive, but it's worth it.

Hummus, chicken kabse, lamb kabse, mixed kebabs, lemonade with mint (a must!)"
ChIJR8ezkGUoQg0RLDuOQWgo0EM,5,"Very relaxed and inviting Lebanese atmosphere. Feels very authentic, the restaurant is stylized like an outdoor bazaar.

All our dishes were light, refreshing, and flavorful. We were particularly impressed with the falafel, tabbouleh, chicken, kibble, hummus, and baklava.

The service was prompt and polite, the atmosphere was a really great touch and brought the whole experience together. We look forward to going back."
ChIJR8ezkGUoQg0RLDuOQWgo0EM,4,"The food was good but the portions are VERY small, considering the price which is extortionate.
The size of the portion should have been half the price it was. Each main dish is around ‚Ç¨22 but is starter size.
Each guest must spend ‚Ç¨27.
The waiter was nice, but as he was on his own it was a little slow. Comfy seating."
ChIJR8ezkGUoQg0RLDuOQWgo0EM,4,"We were warmly greeted in the warm and cozy, inviting atmosphere that reflected authentic Arabic cuisine.
The menu has a decent selection of dishes. Pricey but full of vibrant flavors and textures and cooked to perfection. The quality of the food, the friendly service, and the charming ambiance is worth it. I'm only going to giving it one star less because of their minimum charge rule on the menu. The food is delicious and customers will easily spend without being coerced into accepting the minimum charge. It would make me think about returning if I just wanted to order a side dish or just tea with that requirement on the back of my mind."
ChIJR8ezkGUoQg0RLDuOQWgo0EM,3,"Taste is good however portion is really small, had to order 2 main course. End up spending 35‚Ç¨ for 1 person."
ChIJqVZ7tWkoQg0R7SHH_Jfgf7c,5,"We had lunch here with friends in this small peaceful restaurant and it was excellent. As a starter we shared a plate of antipasti and fried artichokes. The day's pasta dish with pesto, prawns and dried tomato was a really good choice followed by tiramisu for dessert. Service was very friendly and efficient. We'll be back."
ChIJqVZ7tWkoQg0R7SHH_Jfgf7c,5,"Small establishment, romantic and very tasty food.  If you need a break from Tapas, check out Casa Marco!"
ChIJqVZ7tWkoQg0R7SHH_Jfgf7c,5,Excellent food and lovely atmosphere. The service was also wonderful. Absolutely worth a visit for a nice evening out.
ChIJqVZ7tWkoQg0R7SHH_Jfgf7c,5,Simple typical  Italian restaurant. Very tasty and good quality dishes.
ChIJqVZ7tWkoQg0R7SHH_Jfgf7c,5,Amazing food. Noisy though.
ChIJp1FirkIoQg0RVILixZzye84,4,A neighborhood staple with good home cooking. Good service. Friendly atmosphere. Lunch menu is reasonable. They have been in business for a long time.
ChIJp1FirkIoQg0RVILixZzye84,4,Super Great Tapas & Drinks.Quite little place to gather & visit. All that is missing is a sound system & Karaoke.
ChIJp1FirkIoQg0RVILixZzye84,4,"Good tapas and ca√±as place. A bit on the expensive side, but the tapas are of an adequate size."
ChIJp1FirkIoQg0RVILixZzye84,4,Very authentic spanish tapas.. big portions and great price!
ChIJp1FirkIoQg0RVILixZzye84,5,A no-frills restaurant with an excellent cuisine. Especially recommend the Cocido Madrile√±p.
ChIJ1118vUMoQg0R4If-ChIffG4,5,"I had a normal-sized burger with added cheese and bacon and it tasted incredible! I loved the sauce and I wanted to go back for a bigger one immediately afterwards. Here, you can customise your burger's size and add up to 3 fillings; there is a table with all the prices clearly shown.

As for COVID19-prevention measures, this place is take-out only and there is a glass screen protecting the staff. I suggest getting a take-out then going to the green space near the Museum of America or the area near Moncloa station.
@deeyandrax"
ChIJ1118vUMoQg0R4If-ChIffG4,5,"A very old burger joint, where you know you'll find a good burger at a fair price. It's not perfect at all, but it's pretty good for the price. You can only pay in cash."
ChIJ1118vUMoQg0R4If-ChIffG4,5,The best cheap burger after some drinks or a night out!
ChIJ1118vUMoQg0R4If-ChIffG4,4,"Given the price, this was a decent burger!
It has solid taste. Must try."
ChIJ1118vUMoQg0R4If-ChIffG4,5,"Always good. I'm so glad this place is still going strong after many years.
Excellent burgers and fries at a great price."
ChIJgQ6sRGgoQg0RQVXpTtE6BRI,5,Great find! Walking around looking for dinner? This is the spot. Great beer & vermouth! Absolutely loved their award winning Cachopo (two veal steaks filled with cheese & ham). Highly recommend visiting this family run place
ChIJgQ6sRGgoQg0RQVXpTtE6BRI,5,Stopped by for an early dinner (their kitchen was open as of 19:30) and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was really good. I had the Pote Asturiano and my wife the entrec√¥te and both were excellent. Service was great as well. Will go back to taste their award winning cachopo.
ChIJgQ6sRGgoQg0RQVXpTtE6BRI,5,"I highly recommend this place. Food is amazing, the service is excellent, and the ambience is brilliant.  In my list of top things to do next time in Madrid."
ChIJgQ6sRGgoQg0RQVXpTtE6BRI,5,"Cachopo is a typical Asturian dish, beef with semi cured cheese and Iberic ham.
This is the best cachopo in Madrid. They won 2017 first price in the cachopo competition! Huge portions, take one for two people! As a dessert the lemon meringue and carrot cake are highly recommendable! That is if you still can eat after all the above :-). Extremely friendly service., a restaurant where you can have a laugh and a good time."
ChIJgQ6sRGgoQg0RQVXpTtE6BRI,4,"Very friendly people, very tasty croquetas.
Didn't try anything else so no comment on the rest of the menu"
ChIJUaihLUMoQg0RLjGyf0KGeT0,5,"Honestly, I‚Äôve walked past this place a hundred times and always thought it was a good place to stop for a drink. I was VERY wrong: the food is divine!
We had the tuna tataki and the buttata salad and shared french fries, and then also shared a lemon pie.
All of it was absolutely delicious, carefully constructed to be pleasing to the palate and to the eye! My only recommendation would be to serve the leeks warm instead of cold (in the salad), but everything was just perfect!
Bonus point: the gin list is endless. Come here and try a new gin every time.
Shout out to the staff who were mega busy and still managed to be absolutely delightful!"
ChIJUaihLUMoQg0RLjGyf0KGeT0,5,"Really nice breakfast. The veggie breakfast has good combination of fresh ingredients, not too heavy and yet keeping you full. The coffee is great. The rest of the menu looks good, fits for brunch, lunch and also dinner.
The service is good and fast.
You have sits indoor and outdoor.
Enjoy üòä"
ChIJUaihLUMoQg0RLjGyf0KGeT0,4,"Good place to have a full breakfast!

I tried the ‚ÄòSueco Brunch‚Äô served with a salmon bagel, scrambled eggs and yogurt with strawberries. A hot and a cold drinks are included.

It was good and ingredients were fresh. You will notice that dishes are prepared at the moment of being ordered. Nothing of leftovers reheated.

I also liked that this cafe is also a good place to have lunch alone."
ChIJUaihLUMoQg0RLjGyf0KGeT0,5,Great food and gin selection! Staff were busy but delightful. Highly recommend stopping by for a meal and trying out their endless gin list. Casual tone. #TogetherWeGrow
ChIJUaihLUMoQg0RLjGyf0KGeT0,5,Hands down one of the best burgers in the city! Their sides are also great. The price is not that bad for the food. The ambiance is also cozy and they have a nice selection of cocktails.
ChIJM4hS4EIoQg0RpSXQ1Y5mlSg,5,"A lovely place to have a drink and meet with friends. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The tapas are delicious, and the vermut de grifo is definitely something worth trying."
ChIJM4hS4EIoQg0RpSXQ1Y5mlSg,5,"Delicious and very big portions, don‚Äòt order too much! ;) croquettes well recommended"
ChIJM4hS4EIoQg0RpSXQ1Y5mlSg,5,"You owe it to yourself to eat this ... TAVERN SPECIAL TOAST

Stepping into this traditional tapas bar I was in awe of its charm and historic memorabilia. The place is covered from floor to ceiling in vintage keepsakes.

The food and drink we ordered was excellent value for money. We ordered 2 rounds of beers (Mahon) between us, and shared a 4/5 plates between a group of four.

If you're reading this, you must have the Tarvern Special Toast (Tosta Especial Taberna) with egg! It's only ‚Ç¨7 and It blew all of our minds, we haven't stopped talking about it for days. Honestly, the taste is so heavenly it's like drinking from Zues' cup.

The service was good and quick. The staff are friendly and made an effort to understand despite the language barrier.

If you‚Äôre a fan of the classics, you‚Äôll love the music here. The place was rocking with the sounds of Queen, Ugly Kid Joe, and the Ramones, which enhanced the experience.

I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough. The food alone is worth the visit, but the overall experience makes it unforgettable. It‚Äôs no wonder they have such a high rating. I‚Äôm giving this a solid 5 out of 5."
ChIJM4hS4EIoQg0RpSXQ1Y5mlSg,5,"Super local bar/restaurant with a friendly owner. We enjoyed the huevos rotos which were nice and savory, the croquetas were voluptuous, creamy beauties, and the tostada with steak, caramelized onion and cabrales cheese was very good, albeit funky (if that‚Äôs your thing)."
ChIJM4hS4EIoQg0RpSXQ1Y5mlSg,5,"Had breakfast here every day of the trip. Great atmosphere, breakfast, coffee and the orange juice is amazing. One of the earliest places open too, so great spot to come early for a big day of exploring the city. Highly recommend!"
ChIJayU_92QoQg0RQypw0GV8c4s,5,"The best meal I had in Madrid! We were just walking around the area and found this place had a menu of the day so we went in and we‚Äôre so glad we did. Every single bite of every dish we had here was so heavenly, I could not move on from it after a few days. It makes me want to go to Galicia, Spain to taste more of their dishes there. The staff were so nice too, they were attentive and easy to call even if we were in the corner."
ChIJayU_92QoQg0RQypw0GV8c4s,5,"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Found this place as I finished my tour at Parque de la Montana nearby. The wait staff doesn‚Äôt speak English but two very kind strangers helped me with my ordering. Please ask for the menu del dia, ‚Ç¨11.00 for 2 courses. A true bang for your bucks. I was also the only foreigner there at the time so they were all helpful and watching my every move. Even though he doesn‚Äôt not speak a word in English, Antonio (the owner, a true legend) was very kind. The customers at the time seemed to be all regulars, which is a sure fine sign of how authentic and good this place is.

Not sure what I ordered but the rice with egg was the best thing I‚Äôve had so far. The fish in photo was also very tender and sweet. I also had coffee for dessert and honestly I‚Äôve never eaten so well in Europe. A must visit if you‚Äôd like seafood in Madrid.

A special thank to Antonio, Susanna and Rodrigo (2 kind people from Madrid)."
ChIJayU_92QoQg0RQypw0GV8c4s,5,"Incredible value, so much seafood (and wine) for your money. Service super friendly too.

Fyi: here a parrillada is seafood too, not grilled meat."
ChIJayU_92QoQg0RQypw0GV8c4s,5,"An excellent example of knowing how to cook, a simple menu and enormous respect for the raw materials and ingredients used.  This restaurant faithfully represents what it is to eat in Spain, excellent food, simple, exquisite and well cooked."
ChIJayU_92QoQg0RQypw0GV8c4s,5,"Las Zamburi√±as a la plancha, priced at ‚Ç¨20 for 12 pieces, are delicious and perfectly cooked."
ChIJr4-a0lwoQg0Rv6WgkSLc6Qw,5,"A little pricier than expected, but the burrito was the size of my head so can't complain for that, loved it all, will definitely return again."
ChIJr4-a0lwoQg0Rv6WgkSLc6Qw,1,"Found a really long hair, thank you guys for destroying the opinion about the best burrito spot"
ChIJr4-a0lwoQg0Rv6WgkSLc6Qw,4,"Set up like a Chipotle in the US, except they cooked the meat fresh for us when we ordered. We got the steak burrito, and we thought it was slightly undercooked, but it was delicious for someone who loves their steak rare."
ChIJr4-a0lwoQg0Rv6WgkSLc6Qw,5,"Awesome Burritos!!! The system is like at chipotle and it just tastes so much. the portions are also really really big and filling!!
They have a selection of stuff like Nachos, Tacos, Burritos and Salad Bowls and also Cocktails like Margaritas"
ChIJr4-a0lwoQg0Rv6WgkSLc6Qw,5,"Super nice location, delicious nachos and tacos. Also the staff was super friendly, Maria helped us in English and advised us with the options. Left the locations with a happy and full stomach!"
ChIJBV0352koQg0RO1riq2WIomM,5,The signature wings are some of the best I‚Äôve had in years. Hailing from the Southeast United States this is a top compliment. The lady running  the floor/bar was super friendly and accommodated us even though my spanish is a bit broken
ChIJBV0352koQg0RO1riq2WIomM,5,Legendary place. Kuya Jimmy has the best signature wings in Madrid. I will definitely return next time I am in town.
ChIJBV0352koQg0RO1riq2WIomM,5,Yummy foods. Very accomodating en friendly people. Worth the visit during our weekend vacation in Madrid.
ChIJBV0352koQg0RO1riq2WIomM,5,"Service was so sweet. So glad I came here, wings and fries were delicious. Such a cute place, lovely food, great vibe and great staff!! Ended up here on my birthday and the staff treated me like family üíïüíï‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJBV0352koQg0RO1riq2WIomM,5,Bar jimmy is the best spot to go in the area. Jasmine is the best and they cook the best wings which you get with a beer.
ChIJlYQHlWcoQg0RVySaKp-dBi0,5,Super cute place and I enjoyed the tortilla. The locals seem to enjoyed the place  and had alot of Tapas from what I saw :)
ChIJlYQHlWcoQg0RVySaKp-dBi0,5,"Great menu del dia
Perfect spanosh cuisine"
ChIJlYQHlWcoQg0RVySaKp-dBi0,2,"Not good. Years ago they used to have good tostas, but now the food is really bad. Worst huevos rotos I've had in Madrid. I guess is ok for a beer and nothing else."
ChIJlYQHlWcoQg0RVySaKp-dBi0,1,It's the first time in my life.. i have been in a resturant.. we asked the menu.. we tried to order something.. we went out without eat anything.. we paid just the drink..  it has been an incredible experience with a crazy waiter.
ChIJlYQHlWcoQg0RVySaKp-dBi0,5,Amazing service and amazing food. Really recommend the paella. It's the best I've had outside of Valencia.
ChIJuYvFcEIoQg0RTpxLuEtbfO0,5,"Nice and cozy local place with variety of small snack, good beer and cheap prices. You can pay by card"
ChIJuYvFcEIoQg0RTpxLuEtbfO0,2,Don‚Äôt buy the huevos rotos. The eggs were too done and I had to wait for a long time. The potatoes are hard as stone and the workers try to sell you things lying and saying it‚Äôs free. Really bad experience. We ordered together as a group and no one was served at the same. Took 10 mins between each one of us to get served.
ChIJuYvFcEIoQg0RTpxLuEtbfO0,5,Tasty bravas and plenty of sauce
ChIJuYvFcEIoQg0RTpxLuEtbfO0,5,"Excellent service and good, very friendly and polite"
ChIJuYvFcEIoQg0RTpxLuEtbfO0,5,Soooooo good
ChIJjXyWkmkoQg0Rw3TDsk-hpjY,4,"Very affordable and tasteful Asian restaurant. The ratio quality/price is outstanding, but do not expect a fully original recipe like in a specialized restaurant.
Sushi quality is medium, so it is not the best option."
ChIJjXyWkmkoQg0Rw3TDsk-hpjY,5,"I went at around 23h and the staff was incredibly friendly.
I ordered a ramen and a soda for a total of 12‚Ç¨. They definitely know how to prepare a good ramen!"
ChIJjXyWkmkoQg0Rw3TDsk-hpjY,4,"really good food and nice service - a very comforting place. The only thing thay could make it better would he for them to have more vegan/vegetarian options, but I suppose there may not be a high demand. Nevertheless, I'm always happy to come back!"
ChIJjXyWkmkoQg0Rw3TDsk-hpjY,5,"Food, decent prices, good service."
ChIJjXyWkmkoQg0Rw3TDsk-hpjY,5,"Best restaurant in Madrid no doubt. Perfect service, ambiance, and not to mention you won't find a better food/price ratio for food anywhere else. I could go on but you will have to try it for yourself!"
ChIJoelIwm4oQg0RRxIFaOwkRg8,5,"Atmosphere was nothing crazy but you try the tomato and you'll forget where you are. Food was delicious. We ordered 7 dishes between the two of us and couldn't decide our favorite, they were all favorites! The sardines remind me of smoked salmon which I love."
ChIJoelIwm4oQg0RRxIFaOwkRg8,5,"I love that they have half raciones, so we were able to try a few different dishes. Everything was delicious,  but the stuffed tomato was the standout!"
ChIJoelIwm4oQg0RRxIFaOwkRg8,5,"Very original menu not the usual. Above delicious, more like spectacular and special."
ChIJoelIwm4oQg0RRxIFaOwkRg8,5,"Amazing food! Worth trying!! Tapas style, order to share. We followed what our server recommend. Can‚Äôt go wrong. Desserts were also amazing."
ChIJoelIwm4oQg0RRxIFaOwkRg8,5,"Really nice tapas bar, the food was fresh and had exciting combinations. Service was on point, perfectly in balance for the pace and friendliness"
ChIJ823J_GgoQg0Rkv9S2bQ1MyU,1,Quite a joke really. The hotel is under major renovations. Half the rooms don‚Äôt have AC etc. working and the staff just tell you to ‚Äòopen a window‚Äô‚Ä¶ No amenities are working and we were not told this when we booked. Then we have hammering etc. happening at 7AM‚Ä¶ Diabolical. The food is horrendous also. I wish we took a pic of how embarrassing it was.
ChIJ823J_GgoQg0Rkv9S2bQ1MyU,2,"Disappointing experience. During a city-wide power outage, I struggled to find drinking water as even supermarkets were closed. The receptionist directed me to the hotel‚Äôs bar, which was also closed. Only after persistent requests did they finally provide water at the reception. The lack of clear communication and support from the reception during this emergency was frustrating.
Basic courtesy like a daily bottle of water should have been standard. I expected better service in such circumstances."
ChIJ823J_GgoQg0Rkv9S2bQ1MyU,5,"It was a 20 minute walk to most restaurants and attractions but otherwise the location is good. The bed and pillows was one of the most comfortable I have ever seen in a hotel. The front desk person, Rosanna, was such a delight, and the restaurant recommendations she gave were both wonderful, 6 stars for her!"
ChIJ823J_GgoQg0Rkv9S2bQ1MyU,2,"I recently stayed at this hotel and had a mixed experience. Unfortunately, there were some major issues that affected my stay. First, there was no clear information on Booking.com that the gym and pool were closed for renovations. The hotel's website only vaguely mentioned that some services might be unavailable, which was quite misleading. Second, the breakfast area on the first floor was extremely noisy at all times, making it hard to enjoy a peaceful meal (due to renovation?) Lastly, the bathroom in my room had a strong unpleasant smell, and the bathtub was leaking, causing water to run onto the floor.

On a positive note, the red-haired lady at the reception was incredibly friendly and helpful, which I truly appreciated. While the staff was great, the overall experience didn‚Äôt meet my expectations due to the maintenance issues and lack of transparency."
ChIJ823J_GgoQg0Rkv9S2bQ1MyU,1,"I would like to share my experience here in this in Madrid ,I don‚Äôt want to talk about negativity which is really screwed my time here and how reception staff are treating the guest .
but about the young lady in the reception her name is ( Angie ) this lady is so helpful and nice and  this my second experience here and once she saw us me and my friend she smiled and she help me very easy I just wants to say thank you for her because she really deserve that and we have to appreciate good people who‚Äôs working hard .. thank you Angie ( beautiful heart ) ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJ4cRsyWkoQg0RFWgf4LPeDX4,5,"Friendly staff and yummy food.  This is not
Your traditional Korean bbq but I did see an option you can purchase that might be.  Regardless the food and desserts were yummy.  Definitely check this place out if you‚Äôre craving Korean cuisine!"
ChIJ4cRsyWkoQg0RFWgf4LPeDX4,4,"Run by Koreans, Dimibang serve both Korean and Japanese food. The menu is traditional and extensive. Be careful with the waiter's recommendations. She told my partner and me to order five dishes‚Äîwhich turned out to be excessive. Two starters and one main should be enough for two people. There was also not much variety in the dishes she suggested: three of the five were basically grilled vegetables and meat, combined with either noodles, rice or lettuce. The Bimbimbap, a classic Korean rice dish, was flavorless and the least convincing part of our dinner. The rest was good, and the Yacbap (sticky rice) a fantastic dessert. We paid a bit more than ‚Ç¨30 per person. Overall, I'm not exactly excited about Dimibang, but we might be back to try their Korean barbecue (must be reserved with one hour in advance)."
ChIJ4cRsyWkoQg0RFWgf4LPeDX4,5,"We had a wonderful time at Dimibang! We had the beef bbq and, at the recommendation of our waiter, tried grape soju with Korean beer (loved it!). The food was delicious and excellent quality. The service was also outstanding, and really made the experience special for us. We were new to Korean bbq and our waiter helped us out with everything, from giving excellent recommendations to guidance on how to best use our bbq table and the different ways to eat our very complete meal. I would definitely go back, and I highly recommend the experience - it's a must-try!"
ChIJ4cRsyWkoQg0RFWgf4LPeDX4,5,"This restaurant has the best Korean bbq that I have every tried in Madrid, although price is not cheap. Men√∫ del d√≠a is super nice, modest price and great options of foodüòã"
ChIJ4cRsyWkoQg0RFWgf4LPeDX4,5,"Really great place. Food is very tasty and authentic. The servers are so nice and polite and helpful. The owner is so cute and helps you prepare the food and even feeds you the best combinations. We were worried that the korean bbq wasn‚Äôt enough for 2 people and got an appetizer (chicken and rice cake so yummy) but we could barely finish. Ever since I was in Korea, this was the most authentic restaurant. 10/10 recommend. We got an appetizer, soup, water, soju, tea and korean bbq. The sides were amazing."
ChIJhdZWiW4oQg0Rxm_C3x30fhg,5,"This place is home!! I'm literally there at least 4 times a week. Work in the area and I have to go everytime I can. The staff is like family now. Great great food, great appetizers and great service. Who wouldn't want to indulge under the sun in front of one of madrids greatest parks.  It is a must visit"
ChIJhdZWiW4oQg0Rxm_C3x30fhg,5,"Awesome, fast and as almost always here in Madrid, a kind and friendly service, specifically because tere was just one waiter to attend all tables.

We went here to have some tapas and a couple of beers.
Awesome for sunny days in front of that beautiful park"
ChIJhdZWiW4oQg0Rxm_C3x30fhg,5,You can sit in the sun without a jacket even in early December enjoying delicious food delivered with quick and kind service which is rare to find in Spain
ChIJhdZWiW4oQg0Rxm_C3x30fhg,5,Tapas and drinks in the sun next to the park with a great view. What‚Äôs not to like?
ChIJhdZWiW4oQg0Rxm_C3x30fhg,5,Good place to have a relaxing drink next to the park right before or after you catch the sunset at the top of the hill.
ChIJo08DwW4oQg0RrBcPwnoC0EY,4,Having lunch here. Good Portuguese food. Excellent services. The only problem is staff cannot communicate in English. Should rate 4.5 star.
ChIJo08DwW4oQg0RrBcPwnoC0EY,4,"Good food. A bit pricey but you can't find good Portuguese food like this in Madrid elsewhere. This is the price you pay for 'saudades'. Specializing in bacalhau, this is legit. Support your Portuguese businesses."
ChIJo08DwW4oQg0RrBcPwnoC0EY,5,"Excellent Portuguese restaurant in the heart of Madrid. I was welcomed by a fantastic Portuguese couple and some other workers who work there. The food is very authentic and definitely tastes and looks Portuguese. Anyone who wants to try or likes Portuguese food this place is  a heaven. I took a Cod called ""encebollada"" which is very similar to Bacalhau √† braga. It was very tasty and abundant just like the Portuguese dishes."
ChIJo08DwW4oQg0RrBcPwnoC0EY,2,Delicious food but expensive. And the server was irritating and pretty sneaky. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and they charged us for 2 bottles. I asked for lemon and he almost refused to bring the lemon unless I tried the rice without it. It‚Äôs not Michelin stared so what‚Äôs the big deal if I ask for lemon? We ordered three plates of Bacalao and they put everything into one tray which is fine but made us question the  Price:portion of the fish. It was almost all potatoes. I can understand restaurants are going through a rough time right now but they‚Äôre not going to gain a following by pulling a fast one on you.
ChIJo08DwW4oQg0RrBcPwnoC0EY,5,"Well I'm Portuguese so went there with Spanish friends with high expectations! The  service is good and the selection of wines (Portuguese ones) is good also! Small but with the good essentials! The starters where the typical Portuguese rissois y past√©is de bacalhau, all excellent! The octopus rice (arroz de polvo) was excellent as was the Bacalhau √† Portuguesa! The bacalhau √† Gomes S√° wasn't there best as weren't the deserts, still better than average!"
ChIJfXG2Gm8oQg0RxXstrRYhNWA,1,"Unfortunately by far the worst Doner Kebab we ever had. Soft spongy bread, the meat looked weird and was neither crispy nor looked well. Had Ketchup inside as sauce‚Ä¶ had to throw it because we were a bit afraid of the quality of the food."
ChIJfXG2Gm8oQg0RxXstrRYhNWA,5,Delicious Kebab plate. Excellent service. Fresh and quality fries.
ChIJfXG2Gm8oQg0RxXstrRYhNWA,3,"The food was nothing special, and due to the language barrier with the owner/employee, we ended up receiving the wrong order. It was a disappointing experience overall."
ChIJfXG2Gm8oQg0RxXstrRYhNWA,1,"the guy prepared my order have no respect to costumer. i order two kebab WITHOUT SAUCE.  One pollo and one mixto! When I got home, I saw he gave two kebab mixto WITH sauce! This is the 2nd time they do this to my order! WORST KEBAB IN MADRID! I will not recommend this kebab store!"
ChIJfXG2Gm8oQg0RxXstrRYhNWA,5,Good kebab here in Madrid after trying different ones. As well they are very kind !
ChIJ1Zu9TG8oQg0RGg8A1C2dUWM,5,"Excellent Smash Burger for good price! Gus, the waiter is a very caring & polite guy, great treatment & hospitality. Will be back soon!‚úåüèª"
ChIJ1Zu9TG8oQg0RGg8A1C2dUWM,5,"The food was absolutely delicious, and the ambiance made the experience even better. The location is very accessible, which is a big plus. We were served by Gus, who was friendly, fun, and chatty‚Äîhis service really added to the overall great experience. Highly recommended!"
ChIJ1Zu9TG8oQg0RGg8A1C2dUWM,5,"Food and service were both great. They were really full with lots of reservations but Gus was able to get us a table and get us our food quickly. He really went above and beyond to help us with our Spanish and make us feel welcome. Next time we‚Äôre in Spain, we will be back here."
ChIJ1Zu9TG8oQg0RGg8A1C2dUWM,5,"It‚Äôs a solid 5 stars for anyone willing to turn a regular burger into a veggie one, and Goiko DELIVERS! The burgers are juicy and delicious, and meatless!"
ChIJ1Zu9TG8oQg0RGg8A1C2dUWM,5,Amazing experience... especially with Mr Gus he is so nice full of energy for sure go again
ChIJh7t9I_UoQg0RxM02O8Ayz20,1,"Overall expensive bad food !

We has a few pintxos made with old bread, chistoras which got cold within couple of minutes and where not really good, artichokes very basic and dry, and pulpo which was the only good thing but for the price a very tiny portion.

Overall avoid this place go to San Sebasti√°n for real good basque food, or try any other basque restaurant in madrid !"
ChIJh7t9I_UoQg0RxM02O8Ayz20,5,"A delicious experience, the food is perfectly prepared, the service is top notch and the place is very cozy!"
ChIJh7t9I_UoQg0RxM02O8Ayz20,5,"When you are in Madrid it‚Äôs a must try! The basque cuisine is the best and the pintxos (tapas) here are so delicious, so fresh and just melt in your mouth. Atmosphere and the staff are excellent as well. Don‚Äôt miss this place . Highly recommend."
ChIJh7t9I_UoQg0RxM02O8Ayz20,5,"Great place to dine in! either ‚Äútapas‚Äù, or ‚Äúpintxos‚Äù, or beef‚Ä¶ there is no bad choice in this place, and with affordable prices.
The staff is really nice so for sure we will come back again !"
ChIJh7t9I_UoQg0RxM02O8Ayz20,5,"Oh wow! That‚Äôs the best ever! Vasco restaurant never ever been better! Top quality of products, top customer service from maitre and waiters, food perfect cook and well presented! I really love it this restaurant definitely I will come back home with specials memories! Thanks so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJccvtGWIoQg0RBBusXw0w4lI,4,Brilliant service. The waiters were attentive and friendly without being overbearing. The food was so delicious! This was a little out of our budget but we loved the experience!
ChIJccvtGWIoQg0RBBusXw0w4lI,5,"This review is long overdue. After many years of coming to this restaurant, the quality of the food has always been top notch. Rafa is not only is very knowledgeable about food and wine, but also provides an incredible dining experience with his attention and kindness. He recently recommended one of the best wines I‚Äôve ever had."
ChIJccvtGWIoQg0RBBusXw0w4lI,5,I visited tonight just by chance and was so pleased. The staff were great from the first welcome to being patient with me practicing my Spanish. The food was excellent and I had the Tomato and Tuna salad (pictured) and the Tarta de Queso (which I ate before I had chance to photograph!). Definitely recommend to anyone in the area.
ChIJccvtGWIoQg0RBBusXw0w4lI,4,"Really enjoyed dinner here! Found it while we were exploring the area close to our accomodation. The service was fast, and lovely seating in the alley with the breeze flowing through. We even had the street performers give us a dance show while we drank our vermouth. For dinner we enjoyed the clams, cannelloni, and pork ear, all super delicious with vibrant flavours. Reasonably priced too. Recommend this place and these dishes!"
ChIJccvtGWIoQg0RBBusXw0w4lI,5,"Very good food at a fare price, very friendly staff. They prepare something for the kids, even if it
wasn‚Äôt in the menu."
ChIJO6AcolwoQg0Rgn297bVzh-4,2,Decent food but terribly understaffed...
ChIJO6AcolwoQg0Rgn297bVzh-4,3,"- The place does not have natural windows and must have the same decoration as when it was opened about 60 years ago. Perhaps with a small well-done touch-up it would change a lot, including updating the lighting.
- They have the oven as a decoration so I imagine that the suckling pig is reheated, and in terms of flavor and texture it seemed that way. They bring everything up from the basement, which is where I assume the kitchen is.
- The waiter 10/10, his attitude was very appropriate, he was always smiling.

Without dessert ‚Ç¨50 pp plus tip"
ChIJO6AcolwoQg0Rgn297bVzh-4,5,"Today I had the opportunity to eat at this Castilian-style restaurant called Horno de Juan. Since we entered we had very good attention from the waiter Alexander who was very friendly and splendid.
On the other hand, we cannot miss our point of view on the diners such as: The Castellana soup with the best smoked flavor, the Iberian ham and the goat cheese on the flamed caramelized onion and to complement the baked suckling pig which was spectacular.
I recommend 1000x1000 for lovers of good taste and a good palate."
ChIJO6AcolwoQg0Rgn297bVzh-4,4,"Very good steakhouse, good service, quiet atmosphere, very good, tasty food, I don't understand how some say it has no flavor, they lie!!! We loved it, we ordered: Farm beans, Castilian soup, Entrec√¥te, Suckling pig and Lamb. All very good. I recommend."
ChIJO6AcolwoQg0Rgn297bVzh-4,5,"Traditional Castilian food. Very good roast lamb, which is what we always order when we go. Fabada is also a good option. I think the service could be improved for a steakhouse with so much experience. Generally quiet environment. I've been there more than 5 times in the last two years, always for Saturday or Sunday meals, so it's no coincidence."
ChIJR88WkmEoQg0R3qpujpTXJZU,5,"Great place if you wish to grab a lunch as they do menu del d√≠a. Delicious food, quite nice atmosphere and fast service.
Wine options also good! Will definitely come back when I‚Äôm in Madrid!"
ChIJR88WkmEoQg0R3qpujpTXJZU,5,"Very good, well prepared tasty food.
We visited during Christmas and it was the best experience we had in Madrid, raised the bar high. We tried most of the dishes and were very happy with all of them. Out of my head I remember the meatball with cheese inside and an other dish with cream cheese as sauce. Waiters didn't speak English, but that's common in Spain.
If I revisit I wont eat anywhere else!"
ChIJR88WkmEoQg0R3qpujpTXJZU,5,"I really enjoyed my meal at La Musa. They snuck me in early, as I didn't have a reservation. I told them I would be quick! Had a drink and 3 (savory) dishes. All were great, especially the Rock and Roll shrimp sandwich. The fried green tomatoes had good flavor but a bit too much breading...if you are particular about yours. I would choose something else, as the menu is ample! I also had the eggplant and it was great. The service here too was quite friendly. And the atmosphere is fun, with a bit of funky. I will absolutely be back!"
ChIJR88WkmEoQg0R3qpujpTXJZU,5,Amazing food. Mario took great care of us at the bar. Fantastic margaritas and food. Fried green tomatoes and croquettes a must.
ChIJR88WkmEoQg0R3qpujpTXJZU,5,This was one of our favorite spots in Malasa√±a. Yuliet was our server who was fantastic and very accommodating. She suggested the tasting menu which blew us away. Would recommend this to anyone spending time in Malasa√±a
ChIJeeD2PosoQg0RjgT5KysBW_I,5,Best restaurant in madrid to have the suckling pig. It was crunchy and cooked perfectly and the appetizers were ordered were delicious as well as the desert. All in all a perfect experience. Owners are brothers who are continuing the legacy of their parents. Super nice. We wish them the best of luck.
ChIJeeD2PosoQg0RjgT5KysBW_I,5,"What a fantastic restaurant! Lovely place, nice team, and the food is absolutely amazing! Not only is the cochinillo the best I‚Äôve had EVER, but the starters and the desserts are also incredible! I would go back in a heartbeat, I can‚Äôt recommend it enough."
ChIJeeD2PosoQg0RjgT5KysBW_I,5,"If you're looking for a remarkable dining experience, look no further than El Pedrusco de Aldealcorvo. From the moment you step inside, you're greeted with warmth and a welcoming atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.

The meal I had was nothing short of perfect. Each dish was expertly crafted, bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. It's evident that the chefs take great pride in their work, using fresh, high-quality ingredients that elevate every bite.

The service was equally impressive. The staff were attentive, friendly, and genuinely eager to ensure that every guest had an enjoyable experience. It felt like dining with family, and that personal touch made the evening even more special.

Overall, my dinner at El Pedrusco was an excellent experience that I won't soon forget. If I find myself traveling to Madrid again, this restaurant will definitely be on my list for a return visit. Highly recommended for anyone seeking delicious food and outstanding service!"
ChIJeeD2PosoQg0RjgT5KysBW_I,5,"Absolutely wonderful! The ambiance was perfect. Intimate, cozy and beautifully decorated. And the food, well, the food was a plethora of flavors perfectly paired with my favorite wine, Whispering Angel. This is a must go to when in Madrid. The brothers were very welcoming and we felt instantly at home."
ChIJeeD2PosoQg0RjgT5KysBW_I,5,"Authentic Spanish Aldealcorvo food, fantastic food, above excellent service from the owner Antonio. The cochinillo and the lechal were outstanding. The torresnos were very tasty and crunchy. The kidneys were the best I‚Äôve ever had. Antonio recommended a very good Ribera del Duero red that complimented everything. It‚Äôs a must to go when you‚Äôre in Madrid"
ChIJN6Rv1l8oQg0RjcCAjyP2Tkc,5,"Havent imagined paying 21‚Ç¨ for callos before but they are probably the best ive tried in Madrid.. the morcilla and chorizo in there are bomb, while the tripa is clean and somehow not as fatty. Since the bar is like walking back in time, a preserved space like casa Camacho, it's worth paying a bit more since its preserved.

Vermutcito on tap/free tapa were great."
ChIJN6Rv1l8oQg0RjcCAjyP2Tkc,5,"Great place, team very friendly. The food is excellent and not overpriced. Will definitely return."
ChIJN6Rv1l8oQg0RjcCAjyP2Tkc,1,The waitress told me more than two times that because I was alone I had to move from the table when they had not even brought me my food after 15 minutes of waiting and without her having anyone waiting for tables when I sat down. in fact other customers were outside asking to even say good morning to them. Terrible attention from her part.
ChIJN6Rv1l8oQg0RjcCAjyP2Tkc,5,"Reliably good traditional lunch menu, simple but high quality and well priced. Kind and attentive service."
ChIJN6Rv1l8oQg0RjcCAjyP2Tkc,4,"Nice small, authentic and cozy bar in Madrid. I love the fact that they keep offering free pinchos. It makes you feel like you've been invited to someone's place"
ChIJ4eQvqV0oQg0R0Q24dKFZ2AE,5,"They are always super welcoming, making me feel belonging to the neighborhood each time I go there to eat. I like the fact that they tell me what I must eat :D they have the best mushrooms, super fresh, super delicious. I learnt this place 2 years ago when I moved to Chamberi, from my Madrile√±o home mate, I cant stop thinking about coming here for a good evening after work ever since. üçª üçÑ‚Äçüü´ I want to thank for the great preparation, fresh products and super friendly hosting!"
ChIJ4eQvqV0oQg0R0Q24dKFZ2AE,4,"In early November, we visited a charming restaurant during the peak of mushroom season. We decided to try a mix of seasonal mushrooms, and the flavors were exceptional. Each bite was a delightful experience, showcasing the rich and varied tastes of the mushrooms. The waitress was incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to explain the different types of mushrooms we were enjoying, adding an educational touch to our meal.

The menu also featured a variety of authentic dishes, including chicken liver, which added to the restaurant's unique culinary offerings. The combination of seasonal ingredients and traditional recipes made for a memorable dining experience. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, perfect for savoring the rich flavors of autumn. Overall, it was a wonderful way to celebrate the season and enjoy some truly delicious food."
ChIJ4eQvqV0oQg0R0Q24dKFZ2AE,5,"If you like mushrooms,this is the place to go. Great variety of mushrooms and excellently cooked. The courgette flowers are also delicious. Highly recommended!"
ChIJ4eQvqV0oQg0R0Q24dKFZ2AE,5,"Delicious, various, and fresh mushrooms! The degustation plate is highly recommended."
ChIJ4eQvqV0oQg0R0Q24dKFZ2AE,5,"Delicious food, tastes like homemade, especially the boletus! Very busy, recommend booking beforehand"
ChIJLZ9jZIooQg0RqiFtjEOvGxE,5,My boyfriend and I love trying new places and I must say we loved La Despensa. The food was delicious and at a very good price. The staff was attentive and quick. We are definitely adding this place to our restaurant list!
ChIJLZ9jZIooQg0RqiFtjEOvGxE,2,"Don't get me wrong, this place is cozy and cute, the service is good and the owners are absolutely delightful! However, the portions are minuscule, the food tastes bland and the prices are a bit rich for what they offer :)"
ChIJLZ9jZIooQg0RqiFtjEOvGxE,4,"Good Spanish food, great attention and service. Limited (but available) vegan options, which is nice for a traditional place."
ChIJLZ9jZIooQg0RqiFtjEOvGxE,3,"Gluten free menu, but prices are a bit high, they have to renew the decorations"
ChIJLZ9jZIooQg0RqiFtjEOvGxE,5,Very nice restaurant and great Spanish food :)
ChIJtVL8XPYoQg0RPIwYTVjb3u8,3,"Food was ok, michelada pretty good, but they request the payment by bizum and didn‚Äôt take it by card, strange"
ChIJtVL8XPYoQg0RPIwYTVjb3u8,1,"This has to be one of the worst restaurants I have genuinely ever been to. It‚Äôs terrible. The food was really really bad. That said, the food was probably the best thing going for them. The service was incredibly horrible. I‚Äôm not sure if they were having a bad night but it honestly took over an hour for them to even bring water. At no point during the meal did they ask if we need anything. While the servers seemed somewhat friendly, this was one of the worst dining experiences I‚Äôve ever had. Don‚Äôt go."
ChIJtVL8XPYoQg0RPIwYTVjb3u8,4,"I've only had one meal here but I will be returning. The quality of the produce is good and fresh. The chicken is tender and juicy. The prices seem expensive but are actually great value given the portion sizes, I could only eat half - the restaurant gave me a great doggy bag to take home. The waiter is friendly and patient despite my poor Spanish. The decor is fun."
ChIJtVL8XPYoQg0RPIwYTVjb3u8,4,Fantastic food and drinks. Good value too. Staff really helful
ChIJtVL8XPYoQg0RPIwYTVjb3u8,2,"Don't try their margaritas. They use way too much lemonade mixer, and the little bit of tequila they use is cheap tequila. Definitely not worth the price, would've been better of with wine.
Their food comes in small portions, don't come hungry. The food wasn't even good to me. I threw a bit of salsa on there to make it better, at least I had options for salsa.
Overall, wouldn't recommend."
ChIJOdKZ_GEoQg0RhFa5I07N5ZY,5,"Nuria has honestly become one of my favourite spots in the city. It is really a hidden gem. Everything from their sambusa to their platters is absolutely delicious. Whenever someone in Madrid tells me they haven't had Ethiopian cuisine before, I take them here because Nuria is the best in the city and my friends and colleagues always love the food.This place should honestly be crowded.

My childhood best friend and I always go here to catch up after a long time apart. We grew up in a city with a lot of Ethiopian community in almost every neighborhood. So when we eat here, the flavours and the decor remind us a lot of home.

The waiter is always very kind and attentive and the veggie platter and lentil sambusa are a 10/10. I'd say, their Misir Wat is probably the best in the city.

Bring your friends to Nuria!!"
ChIJOdKZ_GEoQg0RhFa5I07N5ZY,5,Family run Ethiopian joint with the mainstay veggie options. Food was really good. Portions were a little smaller than expected but I‚Äôd go back.
ChIJOdKZ_GEoQg0RhFa5I07N5ZY,5,"Perfect, considerate service, catering for a range of different dietary needs without issue and producing incredible, delicious, filling food! Really great in all aspects, thank you very much. (Good for gluten free, good for vegetarians, good for vegans)"
ChIJOdKZ_GEoQg0RhFa5I07N5ZY,5,I had a desire for Ethiopian food while on a short visit to Madrid and to my surprise I found Nuria.  This was the best Ethiopian food I have eaten.
ChIJOdKZ_GEoQg0RhFa5I07N5ZY,5,"God I can never not love ethiopian food. Everything we ate was absolutely delicious, the plate was so well put together and all of the flavors were amazing. The man who served us was also very kind and helped us pick out what we wanted. Please come here!"
ChIJKVFWYIooQg0RzFFatqASQXY,5,"Cervecer√≠a L'Europe in Madrid is a fantastic spot to enjoy authentic German beer and food. During our visit, we tried the L'Europe tray, a generous platter filled with an assortment of German sausages** and succulent pork cuts, giving us a deliciously authentic German feast. The sausages, likely including Bratwurst, Wei√üwurst, and Currywurst, were juicy and packed with smoky flavors, each adding something unique to the mix. The pork cuts, possibly Schweinshaxe (pork knuckle) or Kassler (smoked pork), were tender and rich, rounding out the meaty experience.

The sides were traditional German classics‚Äîsauerkraut offered a tangy, slightly acidic bite that balanced the richness of the meats. At the same time, the creamy mashed potatoes or potato salad added a hearty, comforting element. These sides complemented the platter perfectly, making it feel like an authentic German meal.

Cervecer√≠a L'Europe is known for its excellent beer selection, featuring German favorites like Paulaner and Franziskaner. The wide variety of beer on tap paired exceptionally well with the Leripupe tray, enhancing the overall experience.

With its cozy, pub-like atmosphere, attentive staff, and impressive food and beer offerings, Cervecer√≠a L'Europe is an ideal place to immerse yourself in German flavors while in Madrid. The L'Europe tray is perfect for sharing or if you're looking to sample a range of German dishes in one meal. It is highly recommended for meat lovers and beer enthusiasts!"
ChIJKVFWYIooQg0RzFFatqASQXY,5,"We love this place for its positive atmosphere, all bartenders are usually very kind and soulful, all the beer is of the good quality. We usually gather here in a large group"
ChIJKVFWYIooQg0RzFFatqASQXY,5,"Great place. Top shelf tap and bottle list.  Neat place, busy.  Endless snacks.  Highly recommended"
ChIJKVFWYIooQg0RzFFatqASQXY,5,"Well perfect place for the beer lover...if you go during the happy hour is the best price in Madrid or the rest of Europa...not a big fan of popcorn, boggles or cheese puffs , but  hey!! They kept bringing them, and i kept eating them...and yes they give you a lollipop"
ChIJKVFWYIooQg0RzFFatqASQXY,5,One of the best bars to grab a variety of European beers in Madrid. Their prices are affordable and serve you generous bowl of snacks with your drink. They have happy hour from 18h-20.30h.
ChIJTW9QlV8oQg0RQF566ZdwseI,1,Second time ordering and they give an incomplete order to the delivery driver. This time I asked him to make sure and they said that there was no more to the order. This is unacceptable and really unfortunate.
ChIJTW9QlV8oQg0RQF566ZdwseI,5,Best pizza in my humble opinion.
ChIJTW9QlV8oQg0RQF566ZdwseI,3,"We went here at around 5PM, the crew told us that the waiting time for 2 pizza menus is around 10 minutes. We waited more than 20 minutes. Imagine we are the only customer during that time, what more when there are other customers."
ChIJTW9QlV8oQg0RQF566ZdwseI,2,"Telepizza is probably the worst pizza someone could ever have. i mean to eat this pizza your taste buds must have died a long time ago. i also dont like the eating area, i had to go down stairs to eat and it felt shady. what made it weird was the fact that there crates and i believe a tv that wasn¬¥t on. i only went there once and i have no intention of ever going back."
ChIJTW9QlV8oQg0RQF566ZdwseI,5,"Better than pizza hut and dominos , food simply delicious and lovely friendly staff xx"
ChIJ4ez2NF4oQg0RK6hNYcRkPPo,5,"Went Second time because the good is delicious and the staff are wonderful! Ask for the sea bass dish you will not regret, we also ordered the frid milt that was very good"
ChIJ4ez2NF4oQg0RK6hNYcRkPPo,5,"Very good quality food. Clean, spacious tables.
Sitting outside available.
Good customer service.
My favourite pulpo a la gallega y arroz marinero con alioli."
ChIJ4ez2NF4oQg0RK6hNYcRkPPo,5,Excellent paella! Nice quiet restaurant for business and private gathering.
ChIJ4ez2NF4oQg0RK6hNYcRkPPo,5,Excellent service and very good food üòä
ChIJ4ez2NF4oQg0RK6hNYcRkPPo,5,Good ingredients and well cooked.prices are accordingly to high level standard kitchen. Not a luxurious place though
ChIJNX4gM4goQg0RcY9sdwCrnJA,5,"Loved the atmosphere, and the owner was there to serve us. You better have the translated menu on hand to order."
ChIJNX4gM4goQg0RcY9sdwCrnJA,4,"Compact and bijou is the best way to describe this place! They have a fantastic selection of crepes both savoury and sweet all very reasonable prices. I have tried a few different ones and all of them have been to a great standard. My favourite has asparagus, garlic and mushrooms... Delicious!! Well worth reserving if you want to eat here over the weekend but during the week you shouldn't have to many problems."
ChIJNX4gM4goQg0RcY9sdwCrnJA,5,Very authentic place and delicious cr√™pes !
ChIJNX4gM4goQg0RcY9sdwCrnJA,5,"Great service; hidden little gem of a place in Malasa√±a. Super cozy, amazing variety of authentic cr√™pes bretonnes savoury & sweet! I loved the Moussaka version & the cr√™pe suzette! We will be back :)"
ChIJNX4gM4goQg0RcY9sdwCrnJA,3,"Nice ambience, friendly service, appealing menu of galettes and cr√™pes; yet missing the salted butter taste and a crusty texture to revive la galette de ma Bretagne :)"
ChIJT0Pa_YooQg0RaMdUr_rw1t4,3,"We have been looking for a Japanese set menu place ever since we moved back from Asia. For those working at home days. We came to try Nagoya and its workday menu and here are our notes:

1. Excellent location. Big outside area.
2. Good service.
3. Nice menu options, just like it is in Asia.
4. Quantity, flavor and quality is undoubtedly there.

We thought we found our spot. But, no. We won‚Äôt come to Nagoya for our workday set menu for the below reasons:

1. 10% surcharge for sitting outside. The Sun tax. I hate places that do that.

2. They don‚Äôt accept ticket restaurant. Very difficult to position a set menu alternative in this city when a lot of companies provide ticket restaurant to their employees.

Also, these reasons are the reason why they are missing 2 stars."
ChIJT0Pa_YooQg0RaMdUr_rw1t4,4,"Very good food, fresh sushi and nice ambiance. However, the hostess/waitress with the short hair is rude and needs to work on her customer service. The rest of the staff were friendly and accommodating."
ChIJT0Pa_YooQg0RaMdUr_rw1t4,3,"The place looks good both inside and outside and has very reasonnable prices. And the staff was very professional. But the food is really average. Not bad but a bit bland (including the sushi). The menu includes strangely non japanese dishes such as Shumai (a chinese dish), which possibly goes together with a lack of care in the preparation of the dishes.
I won't go back."
ChIJT0Pa_YooQg0RaMdUr_rw1t4,1,The food that I ordered was awful. Sashimi &sushi was not fresh. The rice of sushi was not seasoned. Just rice. Udon was also terrible. Udon was cooked  totally different way. I could not enjoy. I do not want to go again. I do not want to give any star to this restaurant. I am very disappointed at the food.
ChIJT0Pa_YooQg0RaMdUr_rw1t4,1,I had dinner here for first time and it will be last time. I won't come back. Really disappointed. The food is low quality compared with price. Do not order Udong (really bad). This is Chinese restaurant and No one is Japanese. So sad...
ChIJlXWHRIgoQg0RfQ8rfV_A-yk,5,"Best dinner experience in a long time.

Look, this is probably THE BEST quality/price restaurant in the city center.

All the restaurants that are opening in Madrid lately are own by big conglomerates, meaning, the decoration is top, the food is OK, and if you are lucky you get a decent service.

This is a classic family restaurant, you can feel it when you go in.

You can experience the love of their owners on their restaurant on each detail, which makes it very familiar and welcoming.

All of this is good, but, at the end of the day is a restaurant and the food have to be good.

And isn't good.

Is great!

Spanish-Italian food that feels like home.

All the new places are Asian fusion or something like that, and sometimes is very difficult to find a place with classic well made recipes.

All the starters we had, the mains and even the dessert (not so much the coffee though)

If you are in around Fuencarral o Malasa√±a you have to come here."
ChIJlXWHRIgoQg0RfQ8rfV_A-yk,5,"Nice Restaurant near Calle Fuencarral, the environment was cozy, the attendant and the waitresses were nice and attentive. The food was good. Everything had their own twist which made them different and tasty. The prices are a little over the average, which is normal for this restaurant. Recommend it for a nice menu del d√≠a or a cozy evening dinner‚Ä¶"
ChIJlXWHRIgoQg0RfQ8rfV_A-yk,5,"Extremely great cod, and Iberian pork cheeks. Super flaky tender and soft. service was so nice and homey, and the bread and butter was amazing!!!! Really value for money! One of the best cheesecakes I‚Äôve  ever had!!!!!!!!!!!"
ChIJlXWHRIgoQg0RfQ8rfV_A-yk,5,"Delicious food and the sweetest people to serve you. Would very much recommend!!! :)
Also price/quality very good."
ChIJlXWHRIgoQg0RfQ8rfV_A-yk,5,Excellent food. Reasonable price . Very nice service. Highly recommended. Comimos muy bien üòä
ChIJOyvtj2MoQg0RywVspXwBays,5,"Had an amazing breakfast experience at Carmencita Brunch! The service was incredibly friendly ‚Äî you really feel welcomed from the moment you walk in. The food was super tasty, fresh, and full of flavour. I especially appreciated the healthy salad site that didn‚Äôt compromise on taste. A perfect spot for a relaxed and delicious breakfast. Highly recommend!"
ChIJOyvtj2MoQg0RywVspXwBays,5,"We were greeted with a very warm welcome. I went with my wife and we ate Grace and classic benedit. On our trip to Spain, we had the opportunity to try it in another restaurant before, but we had never tried something like this. We also asked for french fries on our plates. They prepare a very tasty and satisfying dish. I don't remember feeling so full on my trip to Spain. You can have a nice breakfast with coffee."
ChIJOyvtj2MoQg0RywVspXwBays,5,"Was very tasty. There were places when we arrived, and the waiter was very nice."
ChIJOyvtj2MoQg0RywVspXwBays,5,Some of the best service we have had in Madrid. Our server was very friendly and patient with us and the food was all incredible!
ChIJOyvtj2MoQg0RywVspXwBays,3,"It's OK,  they are super friendly but the food was just average nothing special."
ChIJke3682IoQg0ReuQDOuznJPU,5,THE STAFF IS SUPER AMAZING! I am a vegetarian and they prepared a separate dish even in the set menu! They are so considerate and super fun! They made our night unforgettable ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
ChIJke3682IoQg0ReuQDOuznJPU,5,We loved the place though we went for class dinner and it was really a vibe though its not much expensive and the food is really great and they make you dance so much
ChIJke3682IoQg0ReuQDOuznJPU,5,"The food is delicious, there is a 25‚Ç¨ menu that allows you to try everything. The staff is adorable and the show they do on weekends is very entertaining (dancing and plate breaking). It is the second time I come here and I still love it just as much! Recommend 100%"
ChIJke3682IoQg0ReuQDOuznJPU,4,"Touristic but authentic Greek food/culture experience. We went on a Friday night for dinner, they directly gave us the degustaci√≥n men√∫ (tasting menu), there‚Äôs no other menu, so the ‚Äúdegustaci√≥n men√∫‚Äù is obligatory to take, which is 23,5‚Ç¨ per person. The portions are big enough and food is tasty. Everybody in the restaurant is served the food around the same time, once eating is finished, then the dancing show starts. The staff dances 3-4 kinds of different dance (spectacular shows), then they invite guests to join them, distributing plates to break at the end. So much fun! But you can only pay by cash. Accessibility; it‚Äôs at the street level so it can be accessed by wheelchair or crutches."
ChIJke3682IoQg0ReuQDOuznJPU,5,The food is soo good and adorable . Also comes with a pitcher of alcohol & the entertainment is 10/10 u get to break a plate dance and the dancer is literally amazing. Come here u won‚Äôt regret it
ChIJ2e1pjV4oQg0RHJdk3_p4EMI,3,"Stopped at this neighborhood restaurant after reading reviews.
A little confusing as the bartender directed us to the dining room in the rear but once there, a waiter seemed annoyed because we didn‚Äôt call ahead for reservations. Anyhow, we sat in the bar area and while the calamari bocadillo was delicious, then patatas bravas were pretty much the same as everywhere else. As it is outside of the centre area, the price was reasonable."
ChIJ2e1pjV4oQg0RHJdk3_p4EMI,2,We sat outside on the terrace which was nice and we only had drinks. This was on a Friday afternoon but the place was far from crowded. It was however really difficult to get the waitresses attention and we unfortunately ended up leaving after the first round.
ChIJ2e1pjV4oQg0RHJdk3_p4EMI,4,Traditional restaurant in Chamber√≠. You can order typical Spanish food with a good quality and well cooked. The fried hake and calamari mix is one of the best you can get in town. The beef T-Bone is really good too. Sometimes a bit expensive depends what you order.
ChIJ2e1pjV4oQg0RHJdk3_p4EMI,5,"Very tasty food, nice decor, polite staff"
ChIJ2e1pjV4oQg0RHJdk3_p4EMI,5,"I love this place. Feels traditional, great bravas sauce, nice cheeses, kind employees, and fantastic outdoor seating arrangement for a restaurant situated within the neighborhood."
ChIJmeNYxWEoQg0R0NjcOl67GjU,2,"Stopped here on my first night in Madrid after a busy day traveling because it was near my hotel. Very disappointing. This was easily my least favorite and most expensive meal of my whole trip around Europe. ‚Ç¨71 for a plate of mediocre fish and some oysters, along with a few drinks. Service was not bad but not great."
ChIJmeNYxWEoQg0R0NjcOl67GjU,4,"Excellent restaurant! I reserved in advance and got a table in the terrace. Service was very good.
Food, very tasty!
We had 2x starters and a as main we had a big fresh rodaballo fish to share (all for 3 people). Perfect quantity for 3. Thank you for the waiter‚Äôs recommendation. We will def come back as we don‚Äôt live very far."
ChIJmeNYxWEoQg0R0NjcOl67GjU,5,Nice quiet spot in the busy city of Madrid. Today's menu is only 12 euro and the beef filet was so super delicious...... Just like the beer.
ChIJmeNYxWEoQg0R0NjcOl67GjU,5,"Tasty food, kind and fast service. A place to visit again when in the same area."
ChIJmeNYxWEoQg0R0NjcOl67GjU,5,Great place with delicious food and very welcoming staff.
ChIJydfuR30oQg0Ra7iePtWsMVY,3,"Mediocre experience. The Saturday paella came out burnt (note: I know paella is supposed to have a crust at the bottom, but this one came burnt), the salad was underwhelming, the pimientos with beef was just ok‚Ä¶ As for the service, the staff (2 people tending all tables and bar) is friendly, but overwhelmed and overworked - not their fault, of course, and the owner should be ashamed of the situation. At the end, we spent ‚Ç¨25 per person for lunch when the value was more about ‚Ç¨15. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this place - a pity, since they used to have great food at good prices."
ChIJydfuR30oQg0Ra7iePtWsMVY,4,"Splendid service. The waiters are really nice and kind, and the inside decor is perfect if you need to impress someone. They also have a cozy inside terrace! We tried the menu del d√≠a and the food was ok, maybe it would have been better if the portions were a bit larger! P.s. they gave us free tortilla and olives as appetizersüëå"
ChIJydfuR30oQg0Ra7iePtWsMVY,4,"The food is very authentic and delicious, the cold soup is good , the mussels are also fresh and delicious, and every dish is eaten. Jamon is not bad, the bread is not good"
ChIJydfuR30oQg0Ra7iePtWsMVY,5,"Love the atmosphere of this place. Super laid back with great service, good beer and tapas. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better way to close out a busy day."
ChIJydfuR30oQg0Ra7iePtWsMVY,5,"We spent a very enjoyable evening here-  the food was simply delicious served in a very particular setting. The staff was friendly too, and the price of the food was on the cheaper side :)"
ChIJSUmsGGIoQg0R2NutXyNU5MY,5,"I cant wait winter to come so that we can go there to enjoy amazing fondue and raclettes ü´ï  The owners are from Switzerland as far as I know. All food is delicious, fresh. I particularly love the meat being cooked by boiling in meat juice , such a delire! ü§§"
ChIJSUmsGGIoQg0R2NutXyNU5MY,2,"I've lived in Switzerland for 4 years and it was NOT EVEN CLOSE to what I've had... the fondue had way too much white wine which made it bitter in the end, the r√∂sti was more like a plate of tasteless steamed potato pieces! It was still bad after adding pepper and salt! Asked for water and waited for over 20 minutes.. great atmosphere and decoration, they also charge you for the pan & apero without asking. Not to mention, they were suppose to ask if we prefer potatoes or bread, but of course to lower the cost, then have served bread without even asking. The dessert and cheese for tasting were good.

Not worth for its price nor food! They're only famous cause there only one other Swiss restaurant in Madrid. Honestly I was getting a little mad as the food was very bad and charging Swiss price in Madrid. Do not recommend at all and will never go back."
ChIJSUmsGGIoQg0R2NutXyNU5MY,5,"Excellent Swiss fondue. The decor of the restaurant was just like in Switzerland. We had the Fondue de Tell cheese and it did not disappoint. The cheese was perfect and came with a lot of different goodies to dip. We had a delicious drink, Campari naranja. For dessert we got the dulce de leche fondue, oh my‚Ä¶this was heavenly! Service was so great, highly recommend!"
ChIJSUmsGGIoQg0R2NutXyNU5MY,5,"Great fondue, delicious starters and reasonable house wine (perfect with the fondue). The staff were absolutely lovely. This cozy restaurant was a great find. Delicious Swiss food at a very reasonable price. Cannot wait to go back."
ChIJSUmsGGIoQg0R2NutXyNU5MY,5,"Lovely place with a familiar vibe. The host was fantastic. Very knowledgable and made the place feel homely being soft spoken yet engaging. The food was authentic and served in an interactive way, with explanations a little story behind it but never being overwhelming. We had the raclette and beef fondue, both fantastic. Closed off with a chocolate fondue and 3 shots of digestive liqueur kindly offered by the host."
ChIJd6Q4m2EoQg0RvFlGqq2wILU,5,"Truly authentic Colombian restaurant.  When we had dinner there were lots of Colombian families having dinner as well and most staff is colombian as well which tells you pretty much it's going to be great. You have to try the chicharr√≥n, whole fried fish and tostones. Full of flavor.  Dishes are plenty full so you can definitely share."
ChIJd6Q4m2EoQg0RvFlGqq2wILU,5,"It was a great experience. Food was so good. Be aware! Dishes mostly are so big. We were a big table and everybody was so happy with food. As a vegeterian I had lots of choices.
Staff were so freindly and welcome. I think prices concider to quanitity and quality were fair enough. We will come back for sure."
ChIJd6Q4m2EoQg0RvFlGqq2wILU,5,Great place to eat Colombian food. Every dish was delicious!
ChIJd6Q4m2EoQg0RvFlGqq2wILU,5,"The staff is friendly and efficient. You can find authentic Colombian food üòÅ that is absolutely delicious with generous portions.
Definately recommend it!"
ChIJd6Q4m2EoQg0RvFlGqq2wILU,5,"Very very good and authentic Colombian restaurant in Madrid. Hands down the most authentic one in the city. The Ajiaco is done as they do it in the capital city, Bogota where it derives its original name ""Ajiaco santafere√±o"". Creamy yet not too heavy. I also appreciated the protocols to keep everyone safe. From measuring the temperature, to the cleaning carpet and the pretty useful mask holder! :)"
ChIJR6ra1IooQg0RHmU-vHlEi_I,3,"I am half-Japanese üèØ so my standard for Japanese food is quite high.

The Okonomiyaki looks good, the green tea is good, the sushi is not worth it.

The Yakisoba didn't look that good and the Donburi with Chicken and Eggs that I eat was good.

Service and atmosphere is great and lovely."
ChIJR6ra1IooQg0RHmU-vHlEi_I,5,"Hands down the best Japanese food we've had in Madrid. The takoyaki is absolutely perfect! The seaweed salad was fresh, as was all the sushi. The okonomiyaki was very rich and filling. But, our absolute favorite was the spicy ramen! It was a delicious broth with perfectly cooked noodles. You definitely have to try this place!"
ChIJR6ra1IooQg0RHmU-vHlEi_I,3,"We live nearby and here used to be one of our favourites, going almost every week, but recent times the food quality really drops. The curry is watery with mild taste; chicken is dry and hard...hope it will go back to the previous good quality one day"
ChIJR6ra1IooQg0RHmU-vHlEi_I,3,"Very good food, everything was fantastic, and very inexpensive. But service is VERY slow. You get one dish at a time and it takes more than 15 minutes between each dish ordered. Would not recommend going on a weekend."
ChIJR6ra1IooQg0RHmU-vHlEi_I,4,"One of my favorite Japanese restaurantes in Madrid. They have a nice menu with items not commonly seen on menus from other Japanese restaurantes here. For example for men√∫ del d√≠a please try the cold ramen with tempura. It‚Äôs quite good. You can ask them for a loyalty card after you pay, and you can earn points from your visits."
ChIJQeCmZ4ooQg0R_FGADG-VVbw,5,"The best taco spot in Madrid, hands down. Good prices, and spectacular tacos. Come on a Tuesday or Thursday for 2x1 margs; they are great as well!"
ChIJQeCmZ4ooQg0R_FGADG-VVbw,5,"Great little lively restaurant, super busy very friendly staff & the tacos are incredibly good and authentic, great selection of Mexican bears and tequilas. Definitely be back often."
ChIJQeCmZ4ooQg0R_FGADG-VVbw,5,"Tacos as you would have them in the streets of CDMX. You can taste the proper flavours in their ‚Äúguisados‚Äù, the one with nopales and suadero were the best for me. Nice guys, good service. One of the best in Madrid for good tacos at a good price."
ChIJQeCmZ4ooQg0R_FGADG-VVbw,5,"Just come try the mole, I‚Äôll update once more food comes. (I forgot to take all the pictures because the tacos looked so good)
Forget the tamales, they‚Äôre very very dry. The nachos were underwhelming too.
The pastor is also u underwhelming, so I recommend the mole carnitas and cochinita pibil"
ChIJQeCmZ4ooQg0R_FGADG-VVbw,5,"Very good tacos at amazing prices (between 1.5 and 2 euros) in a small hidden place in Chamberi. I tried the tacos al pastor, tinga de pollo, and the cochinita tacos and they were all pretty good. With 5 tacos I was pretty full and for 9 euros it is a bargain. They have a nice selection of margaritas, mezcal, and Micheladas to drink. I will definitely come back for more"
ChIJ5clP9YgoQg0RPPKjDCT2wbo,5,"Fantastic quality and top notch service. As close as one can get to experiencing the best of Galician seafood, at a very affordable price, while in Madrid. Octopus, crab, pimientos de padr√≥n, and empanadas Gallegas are all superb. 100% recommended."
ChIJ5clP9YgoQg0RPPKjDCT2wbo,5,"I love the food and environment, friendly staff, seafood basket is huge. I prefer the prawns more than crabs. Love the pepper which I can finish one plate by myself. Do not recommend soup and oysters. Overall, good food with very reasonable price."
ChIJ5clP9YgoQg0RPPKjDCT2wbo,5,"The restaurant doesn‚Äôt need my review. You do. One of the best seafood experiences I‚Äôve had in my life. I could have died after this meal, but I don‚Äôt want to as I wanna go back."
ChIJ5clP9YgoQg0RPPKjDCT2wbo,4,"Good food, and amazing service. But heads-up, they serve the seafood platter COLD."
ChIJ5clP9YgoQg0RPPKjDCT2wbo,5,One of our most favourite restaurants in the world! We love coming here. The service is brusk but so authentic. The shellfish platter is unique and plentiful and superb value. And the only tourists are Spanish!
ChIJpwLg1WMoQg0R3aMBXW8LOa8,4,"This place is amazing. If you are apprehensive to try raw vegan food, this is a great first experience to have. We had the curry zucchini noodles, mousakka, and the nachos. We ended with tiramisu. It all tasted healthy, fresh, and delicious. Two things to note - a lot of things on the menu were not available (either crossed off or the owner told us they were not available) and they only accept cash. Being tourists, we‚Äôve been using our credit cards everywhere and had to run to an ATM when the check came and got charged a 7 euro fee there. The place is also a little‚Ä¶ dirty? Like not kept up well. I would come back with cash and try more raw food though!"
ChIJpwLg1WMoQg0R3aMBXW8LOa8,5,"Exquisite raw vegan food, fairly priced and absolutely delicious food. Everything is worth trying, one of the best vegan restaurants in Madrid. The concept of this restaurant is one of kind and you will definitely enjoy :)"
ChIJpwLg1WMoQg0R3aMBXW8LOa8,5,"New Year's Eve dinner at Crucina was hands down one of my best restaurant experiences. We got the New Year's Eve menu, which included a juice, a glass of champagne, a salad, TWO entrees, and TWO desserts. Then we got a ""surprise"" smoothie on the house. We came for an 8:30 reservation and didn't anticipate staying until midnight, but it was just such a beautiful atmosphere that I wouldn't want to experience the turning of the New Year anywhere else. The owner was SO nice and brought us the twelve traditional grapes and another glass of champagne at midnight, and gave us fresh zucchini flatbread to go (again, all of this on the house). He explained all the dishes in detail; they were so fascinating and creative! Everything was out-of-the-park delicious. It somehow tasted both indulgent and healthy at the same time. My particular favorites were the salad, zucchini noodle pasta, and tiramisu. Including pictures so you can see how gorgeous everything was. The quality of the food was on par with the very best restaurants in LA (where I'm from), but of course at a fourth of the price. The interior was beautiful too. I am never visiting Madrid without going to this restaurant, and you shouldn't either!"
ChIJpwLg1WMoQg0R3aMBXW8LOa8,5,"It was good, the service was very family like and the food was very interesting!
Would go again.
Shame it was so empty as even the restaurant decor was a cool gardeny vibe."
ChIJpwLg1WMoQg0R3aMBXW8LOa8,5,"The food is really delicious and so full of taste and character. We tried the nachos, vegan spaghetti and albondigas, everything really tasteful and nicely presented. We also met Giorgos and we spoke to us passionately about his food and restaurant mission. Absolutely a must go if you want to try vegan food in Madrid üòã"
ChIJN555SIsoQg0RyEmcZ8oIwRY,3,"Good For a  beer after work. Cheap food for the area but the place feels ""crowded with so many tables on top of each other.

Edited: Replying to a 5 year old review in an offended way probably isn't going to raise your profile much!"
ChIJN555SIsoQg0RyEmcZ8oIwRY,4,"This place has a seating area also on the first floor. We went for a Sunday family lunch.
Great arroz con marisco, salmorejo. Tasty entrecot. Our daughter loved pasta with salsa bolo√±esa.
Very plesent costumer service."
ChIJN555SIsoQg0RyEmcZ8oIwRY,1,Come for your best local raw burger
ChIJN555SIsoQg0RyEmcZ8oIwRY,2,The food is not great. Beware the hidden fees. My 12 euro me u del d√≠a turned into 18 euros due to hidden fees. Buyer beware!
ChIJN555SIsoQg0RyEmcZ8oIwRY,1,"You should not eat there. Get some drinks, that's fine but the food is of very low quality."
ChIJv2lEjJMoQg0RK7Lwq40XKPs,5,"You must visit the Rosewood Villa Magna to meet Lulu, the hotel‚Äôs beloved dog. She‚Äôs incredibly friendly and roams the hotel freely, adored by everyone.
One of our group members caught an upper respiratory infection, and we‚Äôre grateful to the hotel for arranging a doctor within an hour. The reception and concierge were extremely helpful.
The rooms are lovely, the food is excellent, and the service is outstanding."
ChIJv2lEjJMoQg0RK7Lwq40XKPs,5,"Best hotel to stay in Madrid hands down. The rooms are super trendy, good size and the bed is super comfortable. The interior design is very unique and stylish. Above all, the location is unbeatable. Luxury hotel at its best with walking distance to some of the best shopping stores, restaurants and bars/clubs. If you are coming to Madrid, you must stay here!"
ChIJv2lEjJMoQg0RK7Lwq40XKPs,5,"I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel in July, and I can confidently say it was an exceptional experience. Ideally located in a prime area, the hotel provides easy access to major attractions, making it a perfect choice for guests who value comfort and refinement in the best locations.

The services provided by the staff were of the highest professional standards, reflecting impeccable training and an extraordinary attention to detail. The entire team stood out for their genuine warmth and friendly attitude.

The breakfast was highly diverse, catering to all preferences and dietary needs, including gluten-free and lactose-free options. The rooms were impeccably clean, and the room service was delivered at an outstanding level of excellence.

The hotel‚Äôs spa center perfectly complements the luxurious experience, offering top-tier facilities for relaxation and rejuvenation. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking an exclusive stay, ideal for VVIP guests. A true gem in the world of hospitality!"
ChIJv2lEjJMoQg0RK7Lwq40XKPs,5,Great location near the luxury shopping of the city. The hotel is very impressive. Stunning decor. understated luxury. We also enjoy the in-house ice-skating with 'Chocolate con Churos' at the Apple Skate (pop-up restaurant). It was busy but felt exclusive. service was top-notch.
ChIJv2lEjJMoQg0RK7Lwq40XKPs,5,"We have spent five absolute fantastic days at the hotel during  Christmas. You will feel  special from the moment you cross the doors. The rooms are full of details. What a breakfast!, But what makes this hotel unique is its people, with that very dificult balance between being there and not be noticied. Unique ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
ChIJtxP3tvIoQg0R8vW7cUOKZ_I,5,Incredible. Every single bite was delicious and well seasoned. The tortillas and the Iberian meatballs were highlights. Also the tomato salad had the freshest tomatoes I‚Äôve ever eaten. Wonderful service experience.
ChIJtxP3tvIoQg0R8vW7cUOKZ_I,5,"Our group tried the classic tortilla to-go.

We enjoyed it very much ‚Äî they‚Äôre on the runny side which is a good thing!

Tasty on sourdough bread :)"
ChIJtxP3tvIoQg0R8vW7cUOKZ_I,4,"As the name suggests, this place is renowned for its tortilla. Not the ones you see in most places but a good runny one, plain or with onion. Vegetables/salad are scarce on the menu so we opted for the overpriced sliced tomatoes."
ChIJtxP3tvIoQg0R8vW7cUOKZ_I,4,"A charming restaurant located in a quiet neighbourhood where the ambience  is calm and inviting. The food we had was very well made and nicely presented and served. It's our impression that sharing is what's most common as waiters serve you from the main serving dish. We didn't didn't know this so it was difficult to anticipate how much food we each should order. For two people, I'd recommend two starters, one tortilla to share, and one main (""after"") to share.
Our favourite dishes were the razor clams and truffle tortilla, so highly recommend trying both. The iberian meatballs were also incredible.
A few low points were that we bought a bottle of wine, and noticed fruit flies in my glass after the wine was poured. We pointed out it to the waiters and asked for a new glass. We weren't compensated for the glass of wine that we ""lost"" and also had to pay for bread that we didn't eat - it was already on the table when we arrived, so we had no say in the matter. I found the service lacking considering these aspects. Aditionally, the experience with the waiters was very mixed. One stood out as very welcoming whereas other were not so much.
The food was worth 5-stars but the varied service experience is enough for me to consider this a 4-star experience overall."
ChIJtxP3tvIoQg0R8vW7cUOKZ_I,5,"Elegant but still casual, delicious dinner with lots of great menu options. Absolutely worth the visit. We started with the cheese croquettes which were really good but not a necessity. The bone marrow on the other hand is a must. They caramelize it at the table and it was fantastic. As were the razor clams with the melters cheese on top. We then went on to the duck which comes out pretty rare but has a glaze and chutney that really adds a lot of flavors and layers. We finished with the cheesecake where they use 3 types of cheese, very different than what we‚Äôve normalized in the United States but still very delicious. The staff was friendly and worked with our broken Spanish and made some great recommendations for wine pairings. Loved it and would love to come back on my next trip"
ChIJD-o5aYUoQg0RG2siIZpdUvk,5,So good that I‚Äôll definitely head back for another brunch! Fantastic Service!
ChIJD-o5aYUoQg0RG2siIZpdUvk,3,"Food was nice but the brunch was small. The quantity was barely nothing. We went out ok but 1h later we were starving. Its expensive for what they serve. I recommend Panela&Co, they have different kind of bread and you can choose any of them as much as you want."
ChIJD-o5aYUoQg0RG2siIZpdUvk,5,Amazing brunch!! Service was excellent. So much food. Will definitely be back!
ChIJD-o5aYUoQg0RG2siIZpdUvk,4,Good brunch. Decent service. Nice place.
ChIJD-o5aYUoQg0RG2siIZpdUvk,4,Brunch domingos 25‚Ç¨ aprox.
ChIJC4BGk4koQg0RV1rinGt4hMw,5,"The food was okay, but the show and service were fantastic. We enjoyed a lot."
ChIJC4BGk4koQg0RV1rinGt4hMw,5,"Unique, amazing and for sure an experience you need to try."
ChIJC4BGk4koQg0RV1rinGt4hMw,5,"Another Chamber√≠ gem. I‚Äôm not going to lie it‚Äôs a bit above average in terms of price (they have 2 menus : 50‚Ç¨ & 70‚Ç¨ ). But it‚Äôs totally worth it, apart from the fact that menus have a soup , a fish , a meat and a dessert (free flow wine and bread).  All very well executed. But the important here is the fact that the lovely staff of this establishment sings OPERA . So don‚Äôt miss the chance of enjoying an unforgettable night with you loved ones at La Favorita."
ChIJC4BGk4koQg0RV1rinGt4hMw,5,Wonderful food. Cozy environment and eccellent service. The waiters singing opera were absolutely amazing
ChIJC4BGk4koQg0RV1rinGt4hMw,5,"Amazing place. Waitresses & Waiters sing Opera, Arias and Zarzuelas and are such nice people transmiting their happiness. Great food / menu too. A must visit if you are in Madrid and or if you want to impress your guests or date!!"
ChIJ5Xo-kIgoQg0RYezdhSARgI8,4,"Alcuzcuz is a quite authentic place. Placed in the very center of Madrid discloses authentic Moroccan atmosphere, furniture and of course dishes. Something I really recommend from what I have tried is the har√≠ra and bastilla. The staff is Moroccan and friendly. Worth a visit."
ChIJ5Xo-kIgoQg0RYezdhSARgI8,4,My first time trying Moroccan food. I had the Chicken Tagine & my husband had the lamb. Both were tasty and filling. We had hummus as well as babaganush. The mint tea was a wonderful finish to the meal. The restaurant was very clean and decor was pleasing. The gentleman that waited on us was very friendly and provided excellent service.
ChIJ5Xo-kIgoQg0RYezdhSARgI8,5,"Have been two times, both were amazing. Highly recommend - the food is delicious and the service is perfect ü•∞"
ChIJ5Xo-kIgoQg0RYezdhSARgI8,5,"Very friendly and super good food at great price. Ask Tajin and hummus, it's worth it and great quality!"
ChIJ5Xo-kIgoQg0RYezdhSARgI8,5,"Nice place, been there with my family and they were very kind with us - the food was amazing (even our 2 years old daughter loved it!). Need to try the cous cous - great!!!"
ChIJNy4mNoYoQg0RAulY3ZLXYQI,2,"The ribs and fries were barely warm. Waitress was inattentive. Other than three people at the bar, I was the only one in the restaurant and after about ten minutes I had to wave at her so I could order. There were some very small bugs flying around my table."
ChIJNy4mNoYoQg0RAulY3ZLXYQI,3,just 3 stars because my favorite dish from this restaurant is not the same when i came back. it‚Äôs bland. i cannot describe well but it really taste different. i hope they maintain the flavor and deliciousness of the food they serve.
ChIJNy4mNoYoQg0RAulY3ZLXYQI,5,"I had baby ribs, was heavy but this is exactly what I was expecting from it. I wanted to order Long Island ice tea or any other drink from the menu but it was not available. Only beer and classic whisky‚Äôs. Overall service was ok, but they were not speaking English - which is in fact common in Spain so don‚Äôt mention it. For restaurant chains like Tony Roma‚Äôs I assume it would be great benefit if someone would be able to handle guest‚Äôs queries in English. I recommend and will visit again in future!"
ChIJNy4mNoYoQg0RAulY3ZLXYQI,5,"The experience in this Tony Romas was nice. The food was great and tbe drinkd were nice.

The only thing I can mention is the fact that we were told we were going to be allowed only 1 hour and a half to order and have our food which is completely fine as it is a busy location but when the hour and a half passed, nobody came with the bill so we thought ok we can stay for longer and so we did but we never got the bill, we had to go to them to pay for the bill and one of the servers I asked for a ""Clarita"" and didn't seem to understand. I repeated myself and she said ""una radell"" so I wad confused because this is not what I was asking for and turns out radell is the brand of a beer that is a clarita so for her apparently clarita doesn't exist but only the brand of the beer which made the whole thing really awkward and she did not explain this to me. Until a local friend told me she was being funny.

Besides that, it wad a great experience."
ChIJNy4mNoYoQg0RAulY3ZLXYQI,4,"Meat house
This place is a classic burger house with descent and tasty plates. We have tasted burgers, ribs, salads and all plates were good enough. Stuff was polite and helpful. Nice place, descent food."
ChIJwTMJbJIoQg0RJGHKIRKyqiw,5,"Stumbled upon it by accident and glad we did. Old-money glamour, and style with substance. Delicious dishes and warm service."
ChIJwTMJbJIoQg0RJGHKIRKyqiw,5,Amazing experience in a beautiful intimate setting. Every one of your senses is touched here. From the jasmine lining the walls when you walk in to the flowers and ambience. The food is amazing and the service is impeccable. Great experience!
ChIJwTMJbJIoQg0RJGHKIRKyqiw,5,"The atmosphere and staff are exceptional! We took my mother here when she visited from the states, and it ended up being her favorite place! The staff spoke both English and Spanish, and we're very pleased to explain the dishes. They also recommended a very good wine to go with the meal; and were very attentive during the service. I would definitely recommend this place anybody visiting Madrid!"
ChIJwTMJbJIoQg0RJGHKIRKyqiw,5,"I love this restaurant the food and atmosphere were perfect, service was correct. Beautiful interior done with high taste and attention to detail. Definitely coming back. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJwTMJbJIoQg0RJGHKIRKyqiw,5,"We had a very delicious lunch with friends at La Parta. The service, quality of the food, and the ambiance were amazing! Its a traditional Spanish restaurant. Must try! üëåüèº"
ChIJ6WGruogoQg0Rgea718_wEpU,5,"Incredible service from an old gentleman, potentially the owner? Made sure we were all accommodated for before he left & was very friendly. However, I was a bit disappointed with the food as my lasagne was unevenly reheated, with the sides hot and the middle colder, it was still edible however. I wanted to get the gnocchi, however, it was not available, as well as other pasta dishes. I would not recommend the tiramisu also, it has too much cream and not a solid base, a strange flavour."
ChIJ6WGruogoQg0Rgea718_wEpU,5,"My second time here while visiting Madrid. The Burrata was outstanding. The bread that comes with it is incredible, so is the pizza (and dough). There‚Äôs something different about the dough here. Also the tiramisu was homemade and delicious. Service was fast, friendly and fun. If you plan to come after 8, make a reservation, especially for parties of more than two. It‚Äôs a small but quaint place."
ChIJ6WGruogoQg0Rgea718_wEpU,5,Really incredible food and service. The burrata pizza is super delicious and the tiramisu is one of the bests that I‚Äôve tried. Prices affordable. I really recommend
ChIJ6WGruogoQg0Rgea718_wEpU,5,"Very welcoming and helpful host. The wine was sublime (Nero d'Avola), the pasta, pizza and lasagna were out of this world! The ingredients were noticeably very fresh and full of flavour! 10/10 would recommend"
ChIJ6WGruogoQg0Rgea718_wEpU,5,"The food and ambiance are amazing. It‚Äôs def authentic Italian, the pasta tastes so fresh. We just stumbled on this little gem, it‚Äôs a couple of minutes from Gran Via; I‚Äôm so glad we did. The service is excellent and the portions are large, bring your appetite. Very reasonably priced as well. We will definitely be back on our next visit to Madrid."
ChIJRbmdYogoQg0RKkHUCdQayzo,4,"We just had a chance to dine there again with a group of friends after sooo many years. What we remembered was that this restaurant was one of the legendaries in Madrid and the food was exceptional. But on our latest dinner there the food was just OK, nothing extraordinary. The service was good, and correct as always, and while it was Saturday nite, the restaurant was quiet, some tables were empty. I hope this restaurant can find its quality and popularity again."
ChIJRbmdYogoQg0RKkHUCdQayzo,3,"This restaurant was recommended to me. It  is on the second and third floor. You have to know what you‚Äôre looking for. I had my reservation on the third floor. The menu is rather simple Spanish foods, very traditional. I ordered the Fabada Asturias. An extremely large portion for one person. Simple meats came on the side, sausages-and ham. Overall, the meal was very simple, and lacked interest. Maybe it reminds Spanish people of their childhood. This is food you might get served in a farmhouse in the countryside by an uncaring cook. I was disappointed that there was no interesting twist to the dishes."
ChIJRbmdYogoQg0RKkHUCdQayzo,1,"We did not get to try the food. We were seated and neglected for quite some time. After asking the host/captain for a menu, the lady acted like she did not hear me and then came back with the menu. The server was busy talking with other people and never stopped by to even say hello. After some time of that, we decided to get up and leave. Next to my table, there was a gentleman who could have been the owner or someone in management. He attempted to make up for the experience by telling the staff to come and take care of us. It was too late for that. Even though we had high expectations for trying the Fabada, we decided to leave. A great dining experience includes more than the food. This place should do better than that."
ChIJRbmdYogoQg0RKkHUCdQayzo,5,"Had a work team dinner there after I had received recommendations. The food and cider were excellent. Had prawns, octupus, cachopo and pote and they were all delicious. The service was a bit pushy. I would go back. Recommend making reservations."
ChIJRbmdYogoQg0RKkHUCdQayzo,3,"We came here for dinner last night. We had the garlic shrimp, lamb shoulder, hake and they had a bread donut on the table which they gave us a blue cheese to eat with it. The garlic shrimp was decent, and the lamb shoulder was a knock out of the park. Everything else was not the best - The bread was hard, the cheese tasted cheap (but was free), the fries were not properly fried or seasoned with the lamb shoulder, the hake lacked salt and had numerous bones. They ended up charging 6 euros for the bread even though they place these on the tables hours before and we do not have a choice in having it. The servers seemed friendly. Overall did not believe the pricing was justified but giving 3 stars as the lamb shoulder was delicious and we would go back for that experience.

*I would like to emphasize that there was a language barrier. I would like to believe that if that wasn't there they would have been amicable to our feelings if we had been able to voice them."
ChIJ369-7I4oQg0RQffKSJg3ZJA,4,The pizza was good but the place was empty and it took a while for the worker to come and take the order from me
ChIJ369-7I4oQg0RQffKSJg3ZJA,1,We ordered our food from UberEats. We didnt receive any message from the App nor the Dominos place. We contacted the dominos but no one could speak english or even try to help. This is a disgrace
ChIJ369-7I4oQg0RQffKSJg3ZJA,3,Are you annoyed of that places were you feel you have to spend all your dayly salary to get filled? Here you will be able to eat and drink as much as you want for only 7 euros approximately. However pizzas's quality have   decreased over the years and the variety of pizzas that worth it it's limited. The refreshments are also of poor quality because they are powders of flavours mixed with water. Overall I'll strongly recommend you to give it a try.
ChIJ369-7I4oQg0RQffKSJg3ZJA,2,"The pizza is good as it should be for Domino's.
Terrible service the if according to the time that state they close at 00:00 so at 23:10 when we came they told us that it's only take away and we can't stay."
ChIJ369-7I4oQg0RQffKSJg3ZJA,3,"Good if you like American style pizza. I prefer the thin dough Italian style one. They have a good deal on the all you can eat menu, though it's not healthy food at all"
ChIJVziuDPMoQg0RnnHnpaz5rmE,5,"Restaurant Soy de Pedro Espina. Tasting menu. Nasu - Japanese style eggplant.
Pedro Espina is one of the best sushimen in Madrid. You will get one chef's take on the higher echelons of Japanese cuisine using totally fresh, authentic ingredients and a journey through surprising tastes, textures and mixes. The set menu (men√∫ degustaci√≥n) is innovative and has some dishes that are truly outstanding. A Classical Japanese experience. You should give it a try."
ChIJVziuDPMoQg0RnnHnpaz5rmE,2,"As a fan of Japanese food, I would say that the quality of fish (especially the sashimi) is less than acceptable, meanwhile the price is extremely higher than it should be. It‚Äôs ok to pretend to be high-end but at least show some respect if the Japanese cuisine is really what you are pursuing.
In Madrid there are better choices than this. Will not recommend."
ChIJVziuDPMoQg0RnnHnpaz5rmE,5,"This place is great. It reminded me of Japan as soon as I walked in. The decoration is minimalist, and maybe some decoration in the wall would go a long way, but we went there for the food.

The team was also very nice, explaining what each dish in the deg menu was and how best to enjoy them.

10/10 will come back"
ChIJVziuDPMoQg0RnnHnpaz5rmE,5,Excellent food and one of the best sushi places in town. Hidden entrance without a sign at the door but it surely deserves a visit. Chef Pedro was there at the door as we left to make sure we had enjoyed a good lunch. Great service as well. Only 5 tables so make a reservation soon.
ChIJVziuDPMoQg0RnnHnpaz5rmE,5,"By far the best Japanese restaurant in Europe .
The Great Pedro Espina delivers amazing food ALWAYS."
ChIJjVq3240oQg0RgI4jKQuxB_I,5,Very nice place ! Very good service from Javier ! I recommand the paella of the house.
ChIJjVq3240oQg0RgI4jKQuxB_I,5,"Good environment, very good service
Paella a little bit salty, but good."
ChIJjVq3240oQg0RgI4jKQuxB_I,5,"I would like to say that this restaurant is a jewel hide on the wall. Best restaurant in Madrid by far. We ordered the octopus and it was soft and tender , we ended ordering two. Then we have the paella with the rice meloso the BEST the seafood was amazing and the rice well seasoned. We also had the dessert obleas and we definitely coming back. I am giving a high recommendation to this restaurant"
ChIJjVq3240oQg0RgI4jKQuxB_I,5,I really liked the paella at this restaurant (paella meloso marisco) and javier‚Äôs service and recommendations were terrific. Very generous portion size for one!
ChIJjVq3240oQg0RgI4jKQuxB_I,5,"Javier did a very good job serving us
Very tasty food
Recommended place"
ChIJ0x3Mj-YuQg0RU4So0jCQNEk,5,"A wonderful place.
Three days in Madrid, and every day we made a stop here. The food is excellent, both from the menu and the tapas. The service is top-notch, and the atmosphere is very pleasant.
If you‚Äôre in the area, don‚Äôt hesitate to try the delights of Orio!"
ChIJ0x3Mj-YuQg0RU4So0jCQNEk,5,What great food and service. A very pleasant and professional restaurant. We liked the manager Killian personally and service.
ChIJ0x3Mj-YuQg0RU4So0jCQNEk,5,"We arrived late (11:30om) from Valencia and were famished! Diego was welcoming, well versed with the menu, and gave great suggestions. His English was excellent which was incredibly helpful for us. We ordered the grilled leeks, asparagus and baked hake. The food was super fresh and tasted amazing. We highly recommend this restaurant."
ChIJ0x3Mj-YuQg0RU4So0jCQNEk,5,"During my recent visit to Madrid, I had the pleasure of dining at ORIO Fuencarral, a restaurant that offers an authentic Basque culinary experience. The establishment features a vibrant pintxos bar on the ground floor, showcasing a wide array of freshly prepared cold and hot pintxos, each priced at ‚Ç¨2.50. The variety and quality of these bite-sized delights were truly impressive, with options ranging from seafood to vegetarian selections.

For those seeking a more formal dining experience, the upper floor provides an √† la carte menu featuring traditional Basque dishes. I particularly enjoyed the grilled calamari, which was expertly prepared and served with a subtle combination of olive oil and crunchy garlic‚Äîa dish highly recommended for seafood enthusiasts.

The ambiance of ORIO Fuencarral is both lively and welcoming, making it an ideal spot for enjoying a meal with friends or family. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable, offering excellent service throughout our visit. Additionally, the restaurant boasts a well-curated selection of wines, including regional favorites that complement the menu perfectly.

Located in the bustling shopping district of Fuencarral, ORIO serves as a delightful retreat for shoppers and food lovers alike. Whether you're in the mood for a quick pintxo at the bar or a leisurely dinner upstairs, ORIO Fuencarral delivers an exceptional dining experience that captures the essence of Basque cuisine"
ChIJ0x3Mj-YuQg0RU4So0jCQNEk,5,"The pat√© de cerdo al horno de le√±a es para convertirte. Absolutely gorgeous place. Clean, friendly atmosphere, lovely waitresses.  Reminded me aneng English pub. Everything I eate was just delicioso.  Got to go back."
ChIJtYDFnpYoQg0RxCiQnrXRZcc,5,"Upon arrival: My family and I arrived really early (before 5am) and the staff  was incredibly helpful, friendly and efficient (they deserve 6 stars, not 5). We asked for a ridiculously early check-in. They could not have a room ready at that time. But as soon as they could (8:30am) our rooms were ready for us. In the meantime, we were offered drinks. My wife and I had a few servings of delicious coffee at their very comfortable library lounge. At 7am the restaurant opened, and we were served breakfast. Unfortunately, the weather is still too cold for the restaurant terrace to be comfortable, so we had our breakfast indoors.

The servers at the restaurant: excellent attitude and service!

The people at the front desk: Ditto. They were very patient in arranging for a day-trip for our family (we ended up going to amazing Toledo). They even got us a pair of tickets for the Champions League semi-finals at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.

All in all: excellent experience!!!!"
ChIJtYDFnpYoQg0RxCiQnrXRZcc,5,"A hotel with staff that are willing to go that extra milage for a complete customer satisfaction. The star of this 5 star hotel other than that it is super well situated, is by far their staff. Every member of the staff is super attentive. They have smiles at all times welcoming you to any request that may be needed. We met 4 bellboys while there and all 4 were perfectly attentive whether running with umbrellas or just saying hello.
The staff at the breakfast were just as amazing, they are always perceptive. the first day I had a tummy ache and couldnt finish my eggs benedict, the head staff quickly offered for take away and the next morning asked me how i was feeling. very sweet and considerate of him.
I asked them if they can get my car to be cleaned and for me to have it at timings where I might need it, they got it cleaned at 8am.
A very kind gesture was also that they offered us well over their normal check out timing for a very special requirement by us which is what differentiates them from other hotels is the extent they can go to make their clients happy."
ChIJtYDFnpYoQg0RxCiQnrXRZcc,5,"Carolina from the reception
Rachel from dining
Both are very attentive with the guest
All the staff are welcoming and helpful"
ChIJtYDFnpYoQg0RxCiQnrXRZcc,5,"Amazing hotel. Best staff and service I have experienced in all the years of travel. Just perfect. Great location, great people. Everything done at peak professionalism. Sorry we could not stay longer and would love to stay again.
Small lovely property - ideal for adults and couples."
ChIJtYDFnpYoQg0RxCiQnrXRZcc,5,"One of our best experiences ever at a hotel.  From the minute we arrived to the moment we departed, the service was impeccable. Elena was most helpful taking care of our special requests and every other member always greeted us with a smile and was there to help.  This hotel understands hospitality.  Thanks for a marvelous week."
ChIJP3Jf-uwoQg0Rh5coctpDKto,5,"I had an amazing lunch experience. The staff were friendly, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was great.

I had a business lunch; it had everything you would want in a lunch."
ChIJP3Jf-uwoQg0Rh5coctpDKto,5,"As advertised. This place did not disappoint. Sashimi, maki, tempuras etc. were fresh and skilfully prepared. Sake and wine menu were bountiful. The suprise highlight, however, was the simple grilled eggplant with red miso paste. Just divine. Service was professional and friendly, albeit they keep forgetting to refill our water since they were so busy. Cake with candle request was easily catered for with no fuss. A class act in every sense of hospitality. Arigato gazaimas."
ChIJP3Jf-uwoQg0Rh5coctpDKto,4,"Some of the things were really good such as the scallops, the spicy tuna tartar and the desserts; however, others were not up to standards like the king crab and the toro. Overall experience was good."
ChIJP3Jf-uwoQg0Rh5coctpDKto,5,"One of the best Japanese restaurant in Madrid, and the price is also good . However, the Wagyu is not very amazing, the rest of it was delicious, and the dessert is super tasty."
ChIJP3Jf-uwoQg0Rh5coctpDKto,3,"This place was good but it lacks personality. It caters to an executive type of diners. The food was good and their lunch menu wasn't too expensive. But there are more vibrant places (Santoku üòâ) on this budget.

It felt as if though the staff were the ones filling the place and not the other guests. The timing of the servers wasn't all that good either. They removed the plates too quickly and were a bit invasive.

On a positive note. Kudos to the waiter who modified our order for us.

They could also use some fresh menus and good Oshibori (hand wipes).  Their bar area needs a touch up. It was uninviting and cluttered.

Unless you're in the area for lunchtime. I wouldn't recommend this place that much."
ChIJg1aH35UoQg0RX-Q3kDp8YQQ,5,"A stylish and modern spot with consistently good food and service.

- The menu offers creative takes on Spanish food, perfect for sharing.
- The ambiance is elegant yet relaxed, making it great for both casual meals and special occasions. - Prices are a bit high but the quality and location demand it.

However, it was not easy to communicate with the staff in English."
ChIJg1aH35UoQg0RX-Q3kDp8YQQ,4,"Great late spot, with a generous and tasty sangria. It was busy and a little cramped but service was pretty fast. Some bites were better than others but overall a great experience for more of a drink and some tapas."
ChIJg1aH35UoQg0RX-Q3kDp8YQQ,5,"Absolutely love Lateral! Have been coming here for many years, food and ambiance are at their best and Amalia was a fantastic waitress. I recommend it to friends and family all the time!"
ChIJg1aH35UoQg0RX-Q3kDp8YQQ,5,"This was an amazing place for tapas
We arrived on a Friday evening at 7:30, group of 7. Although there was no room on the patio, they are quick to figure out seating for our group inside with no reservations.
The waiters were very nice and the food came quickly.
We most enjoyed the octopus and the sangria was very good."
ChIJg1aH35UoQg0RX-Q3kDp8YQQ,5,"Fun variety of shareable tapas. Sangria was  refreshing. Reservations seem to be needed for outside dining.  But, we had no trouble getting an inside table on a Tuesday night."
ChIJO3f42OwoQg0RxN82sK5Qokc,3,"While the service is friendly and impeccable, the local itself is incredibly out dated, worn and in desperate need of renovation.

Worth mentioning that the coat check is cash only...which is the rather inconvenient.

The staff itself is quick, friendly and attentive.

They deserve better than what they are given to work with."
ChIJO3f42OwoQg0RxN82sK5Qokc,5,"Very convenient location in the heart of Madrid. Great interior, amazing fluffy beds with all facilities. Super tasty food all times of the day! Nice roof top with great view! Staff was very friendly and helpful."
ChIJO3f42OwoQg0RxN82sK5Qokc,3,"Since the momento we arrived they acted as they didn‚Äôt want us there. We called in advance to make a reservation and specifically said we wanted to watch the game between madrid-Manchester city. They said it was ok. 20 minutes before the game ended they brought the check without us asking and started to put pressure on us leaving. We didn‚Äôt get to watch the end of the game. We had dinner pizza was ok, the tarta de queso was good but too small for the price."
ChIJO3f42OwoQg0RxN82sK5Qokc,5,"Hired a private event for my birthday there. I  had a blast. The only thing missing was more food. Although it tasted good it was just to few, too small."
ChIJO3f42OwoQg0RxN82sK5Qokc,4,"Very recommendable night club and restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating.  Quiet spot right at the back of the cramped Castellana Avenue.  Assorted original and well prepared dishes, a bit pricey but with excellent quality and presentation.  Great service."
ChIJb4j1fpYoQg0RvPcji5FJUWc,4,"One of the restaurants in the area that is open at 4 pm for late lunch. The resto also closes at 12 midnight. The staff was very attentive, offering suggestions. The food was authentic. One of the best prawns we had. The soup was a highlight as well. If you want seafood for a good price coupled with good service in Salamanca, this is a good restaurant to go to. We will be back."
ChIJb4j1fpYoQg0RvPcji5FJUWc,3,"Good option when in the area, the place is big, traditional and the staff is really friendly and attentive. The octopus is tasty, the meat isn‚Äôt tender that is something that could be improved. They have a bar at the entrance if you want tapas as well."
ChIJb4j1fpYoQg0RvPcji5FJUWc,4,Beautiful restaurant.   Their seafood and meat dishes are good.  Portions are large and the soup is nice.
ChIJb4j1fpYoQg0RvPcji5FJUWc,5,"service was amazing!!! slightly overpriced but food was good - favs were the seafood soup, octopus with patatas, and red prawns!! GREAT VIBES if you‚Äôre eating at this restaurant during an el clasico match."
ChIJb4j1fpYoQg0RvPcji5FJUWc,1,"Its a SCAM. You go in and the waiters will tell you that they have fresh seafood that he recommends. We said OK. They charged us for 6 red shrimps 91.20 (15 euros unit) euros and for 2 crayfish 112 (56 euros a unit) euros and for 2 carabineros (Scarlet Shrimp) 75 (37euros a unit) euros. The menu doesn't specify the approximate unit cost and they never show you how much it weights until you get the bill. Which its a complete scam the weight and quantity are completely off. We ended up paying 340 euros for lunch.
After looking at the review's I immediately saw its their way of scamming people. It happens again and again to a lot of people in this restaurant.
STAY FAR FAR AWAY."
ChIJG2o4jJUoQg0Rc_4jr2ZP8gE,2,"I like this location, but unfortunately the quality of the drinks greatly varies depending on who is working that day. Today, Sunday July 2, I asked for a grande matcha latte extra hot, and I got it kind of cold and mostly water‚Ä¶ for a ‚Ç¨6 drink this is just unacceptable‚Ä¶. But regardless of my complaints, the ladies at the counter don‚Äôt do anything to make it better."
ChIJG2o4jJUoQg0Rc_4jr2ZP8gE,5,The location is excellent. The service extraordinary. The customer service by the staff is exceptional. Clean. Comfortable. Absolutely wonderful
ChIJG2o4jJUoQg0Rc_4jr2ZP8gE,5,If a coffe shop don‚Äôt have outdoor seating arrangements it‚Äôs not a coffee shop great location and great outdoor seating recommended
ChIJG2o4jJUoQg0Rc_4jr2ZP8gE,2,"Service today in a busy hour (15pm.) ?The staffs at the beverage preparation was very noisy talking to eachother very high voice, on calling clients name was unpresentable face and making clients embarrassed with them arguments!! The service have to be improved and it on the famous street in Madrid."
ChIJG2o4jJUoQg0Rc_4jr2ZP8gE,3,No longer a reserve. Tables were full of dirty plates.
ChIJEWwvfpQoQg0R000wGs5dBBY,5,"Wonderful! Starting with the dining room - upscale and elegant. Next the service - attentive, friendly, and plentiful. I have really only had sushi here so I have to review that. The sushi is excellent. The flavor is amazing and not overwhelmed by heavy sauces. The fish is the star, as it should be. High quality, fresh, and best of all they don‚Äôt give you paper thin slices. Here you will find quality at reasonable prices."
ChIJEWwvfpQoQg0R000wGs5dBBY,4,"üçΩFood: 5/5
ü§µüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èService: 4/5
ü™ëAmbiance: 4/5 (Entrance is unattractive)

üìùNotes: I found out about this place as the parent company also owns Sushibar Tottori. So I decided to check it out and see if I enjoyed my meal as much as I did at the other restaurant. After trying out their food, I can confirm that the quality is up to par with the food. The service was decent, sometimes I had to wait for the waiter or waitress to get my attention which could be a bit annoying. And lastly for the ambiance, I was a bit disappointed to find my table a bit dirty in regards to crumbs left on most of the seats, I asked the host and he was happy to resolve the issue.

PS. The entrance of the restaurant is very unattractive as the garbage is on the right hand side and a bunch of stickers are on the wall next to the door. When I first arrived at the location, I hesitated, I thought I entered from the back or something. I think the restaurant should look into renovating the entrance and make it feel more exciting and welcoming :)"
ChIJEWwvfpQoQg0R000wGs5dBBY,5,"FUKU is my top one place to treat myself. The flavour, the quality of the seafood and Wagyu, and the service are all very impressive. If you wish to taste something out of the menu, you should reserve with them."
ChIJEWwvfpQoQg0R000wGs5dBBY,3,"The service here was excellent, but the food was a bit strange and not really that good.  We had the spicy toro roll which had a strange watery mayo sauce, and the toro itself had some inedible pieces still attached to the fish.  My partner had to extract it for every piece.  Would try other places instead"
ChIJEWwvfpQoQg0R000wGs5dBBY,5,"Loved it, felt like a real treat to eat here. Sushi was fresh, service was quick, we got here early at 8pm and had the restaurant to ourselves before the rush hour which was nice. would recommend the dumplings ü•ü beautiful"
ChIJfQw9y-ooQg0R1-_tmNr9QUI,5,Very quiet and beautiful decor. Apple pie is amazing. Fast service and good recommendations.Their free starter and after dinner cookie are both delicious!
ChIJfQw9y-ooQg0R1-_tmNr9QUI,5,"Delicious food and impeccable service. Very classy feel to the restaurant, staff extremely attentive. I loved the carpaccio, and the apple dessert recommended by the waiter was superb. Very much recommend it!"
ChIJfQw9y-ooQg0R1-_tmNr9QUI,4,"Very private restaurant, it‚Äôs a fancy restaurant that gives you a friendly service with food that contains ingredients grown in the backyard (this week was tomatoes). Would recommend for business dinners."
ChIJfQw9y-ooQg0R1-_tmNr9QUI,5,It was simply amazing. The menu is not big which is often the sign of cooking only with fresh products and everything was delicious. The service was perfect with very good advices for the wine which was simply marvellous. I'll come back as soon as I'm back in Madrid :)
ChIJfQw9y-ooQg0R1-_tmNr9QUI,5,"Beautiful restaurant with a lot of attention to details.
Very friendly staff and timely service.
Staff recommended some dishes and a bottle of wine that we enjoyed very much. Fresh ingredients and delicious meals.
Dessert was to die for.
Definitely a must."
ChIJHdnMq5UoQg0RwLxb_sl_r5o,5,Absolutely lovely. What a charming host. Food to die for. It was super. We loved every moment of our time here and came twice. It is probably one of the best meals we have ever eaten on holiday and the setting is delightful. We cannot recommend enough. What a treat.
ChIJHdnMq5UoQg0RwLxb_sl_r5o,5,"One of the best meals I had im Madrid. Beautiful place, with a fairly trained staff (not well prepared for tourists) and a really good wine list. The food is just perfect. Really. We started with the Russian Salad, moving to the traditional Hispanic (Eggs, Jamon & Fries) and for the end a perfect Socarrat Rice with Rice. Just come here and have a good time."
ChIJHdnMq5UoQg0RwLxb_sl_r5o,5,"We had a very pleasant dining experience at the ‚ÄúTaberna Puerto Lagasca‚Äù. The formula is simple: Good quality food, attentive staff and a cozy atmosphere. We did not have a reservation and decided to walk in based on intuition. They accommodated us and offered a free appetizer while waiting for the food order. We shared a very decent Mediterranean meal combination of cod fish and vegetables with a couple of glasses of wine at a very reasonable price considering the premium location of the place. Overall a solid A+ establishment."
ChIJHdnMq5UoQg0RwLxb_sl_r5o,5,"A very small but good enough restaurant at street!  The taste really beyond my expectations! 2 kinds of pre-meal bread with home made sauce, one is tomato with tiny pieces of leaves, another is potato pancake which look normal but taste really good!
The only thing is no English menu and a little bit hot when seating outside."
ChIJHdnMq5UoQg0RwLxb_sl_r5o,5,"Absolutely superb food. Wine was good too. The main waiter who attended us that day was an absolute delight.
I had the salmon with asparagus, which comes with orange slices too, holy smokes was it good.
The place looks small but there's a small hallways which brings you to an open eating section in the back."
ChIJqaU3X5YoQg0RvdLEMXAx0j4,5,"Best seafood restaurant in Madrid.
Wide selection from the Mediterranean sea.
Very reasonable price for the quality food, ambience and service.
We ordered all the delicacies like fish, lobster, Crab and prawn."
ChIJqaU3X5YoQg0RvdLEMXAx0j4,5,You can‚Äôt do anything wrong here. Very traditional Madrid restaurant. Great seafood. Try to get a table in the front room. Acoustic in backroom and atmosphere not very nice‚Ä¶ else super.
ChIJqaU3X5YoQg0RvdLEMXAx0j4,3,Great wine.  Salty fish.  Cold potatoes (even after having them replaced) mediocre salad and stale bread.  And yet they have a photo of the üëë  dining in the restaurant.  So who am I to complain?
ChIJqaU3X5YoQg0RvdLEMXAx0j4,2,"This place is the definition of ‚Äúfor locals only‚Äù. If you‚Äôre not someone the maitre d‚Äô will shake hands with to welcome you, don‚Äôt bother coming. This place is patronised mostly by old money types who‚Äôve come here for years and years.

As a solo diner I was seated at the very back at a tiny table in front of the kitchen door - not an agreeable location with the bustling service coming in and out of the kitchen right by me. Service was impersonal and rushed.

The food itself: I ordered white asparagus (in season); very meh. I also ordered 2 king prawns, large and delicious - and ‚Ç¨66 for both. They were good but not worth that much."
ChIJqaU3X5YoQg0RvdLEMXAx0j4,4,Great seafood spot. This is where the locals go. Good quality and nice selection. This is a traditional upscale seafood restaurant in a beautiful part of Madrid. Service can be hit or miss. Make a reservation
ChIJHW6eS5UoQg0RVcHwruoZniI,5,"We first discovered La Penela on a trip to La Coru√±a in Galicia where it‚Äôs from. So happy they have branches in Madrid.

Love their Zambiri√±as (don‚Äôt forget to dip that bread in the sauce!), Navajos (sadly not available during this visit), asado de ternerq, croquettas, tortilla de para, cazuelas, chipirones a la plancha & FILLOAS for dessert.

We paid 38 per person but ate like kings including drinks, dessert and coffee. Well worth it. The interiors are beautiful and the staff friendly and fast. Highly recommended b"
ChIJHW6eS5UoQg0RVcHwruoZniI,2,"It said it is a Galician food but very far from it. The service was horrible and the food too. Please, do not order the spanish Tortilla of Betanzos. My goodness, it was really disgusting. The chef has to go to Betanzos to learn how to do it. We asked for an octopus, nothing outstanding. The baked meat, it was super dry and with French fries because the side that belonged to the dish was no longer available. We asked for a sangria, and they only had tinto de verano. We also asked for clams they did not have more either. The server were very basic and unpolite. I definitely do not recommend it. 0%"
ChIJHW6eS5UoQg0RVcHwruoZniI,5,"One of my favourite restaurants in Madrid ! Food is always very delicious ! Tortilla de patatas is something special . Also I like seafood in this restaurant , always fresh and prepared so tasty. And famous Spanish desert ‚Äúarroz con leche‚Äù is so delicious there."
ChIJHW6eS5UoQg0RVcHwruoZniI,5,"one word.
WOW.
this restaurant is amazing, everything was perfect from the service, to the food.
i don't remember exactly what we ordered but i remember i enjoyed everything, this is authentic spanish food and you won't be deceived.
don't skip on their white one."
ChIJHW6eS5UoQg0RVcHwruoZniI,2,"How to ruin a good meal when staff don‚Äôt know what they are doing‚Ä¶.

The meal was all right‚Ä¶ fair approximation on how Galician food should be. I mean, if you are really into this geographic cuisine then you are better off taking the effort to travel up north of the country, but for a Sunday night in the capital of Spain it does the job. Now, that‚Äôs the food itself. So my two stars are for the great atmosphere they created inside and the chef‚Ä¶ other than that, the service was terrible. You can see on the first food picture, the waitress literally threw the plate on the table and a bit of food came out without even caring to say anything‚Ä¶ took forever to get noticed, and had to walk up front to be able to pay. I keep saying that no matter how good or mediocre the good is, most of the power relies behind how the service team makes you feel during your meal. And they definitely made us feel worthless during our dinner. So, not sorry, but we won‚Äôt come back."
ChIJ40q0ib8oQg0R0yNmkTCDn0k,5,"Absolutely delicious.  We ordered the grilled Octopus üêô and it was perfect . The cheese starter was really good as well . The prices are reasonable.

I would definitely return to taste other dishes."
ChIJ40q0ib8oQg0R0yNmkTCDn0k,5,A more than decent place for seafood! I especially enjoyed the prawns which tasted great. The service staff was excellent. The Sangria was good too.
ChIJ40q0ib8oQg0R0yNmkTCDn0k,5,"Undoubtedly a 5* star experience - such high standards of cleanliness, quality of food, wine (by the glass too) and service.

We arrived before the lights were turned on ... 7.30pm opening times seem common practice throughout Madrid (outside of the tourist traps).

We asked for an English menu and then started practicing our Spanish... Once we started speaking Spanish it was a wonderful experience and the staff really warmed to us! Effort is everything. The food portions are large, the glasses of wine very generous and the food prepared and cooked to perfection. We ordered 4 dishes (one we were given by mistake however my partner wouldn't let it go üòÖ) We were surrounded by locals in a very relaxed environment üòÅ the staff were very friendly and very accommodating.

We will probably visit again during our stay here in Madrid."
ChIJ40q0ib8oQg0R0yNmkTCDn0k,4,"Excellent restaurant with outstanding service. The tomato and tuna belly salad (ventresca de at√∫n) is refreshing and full of flavor. Their fish dishes, especially the sea bass, are incredibly fresh and perfectly cooked. They also offer a great selection of wines. The place is always lively, with a vibrant atmosphere. The only area where there‚Äôs room for improvement is the dessert menu"
ChIJ40q0ib8oQg0R0yNmkTCDn0k,4,"I really love this restaurant! It had delicious food, a nice atmosphere and a good location, but the only reason I couldn‚Äôt give it a 5 is because of the service. The staff are attentive but they are rude. Overall, this is a good restaurant with amazing food. Recommend üòÉ"
ChIJ7fF3jpYoQg0RcfOxYBExJrY,5,"The market was not that crowded on a weekday afternoon. The whole place was clearly renovated and was clean just like a supermarket selling fresh produce, seafood, ham and cheese, pastries and other local ingredients.

The small restaurants are located at the back of the market. It mainly features Spanish cuisines."
ChIJ7fF3jpYoQg0RcfOxYBExJrY,5,"I came here to eat at Casa Dani, this market turns out to be one of the most pleasant experience, good assortment, good restaurants also!"
ChIJ7fF3jpYoQg0RcfOxYBExJrY,4,"A good market to visit if you happen to be in the area.

Casa Dani: Good spot for food. Excellent  omelette. They have many shops and the line moves fast."
ChIJ7fF3jpYoQg0RcfOxYBExJrY,5,"Great place to buy your groceries!! Fresh and good quality and cheaper than other places. I love to come and choose the fruits and vegetables so fresh. Meats, poultry, and fish are excellent quality, too. 150% recommended it."
ChIJ7fF3jpYoQg0RcfOxYBExJrY,4,Quiet small market in a posh area of Madrid. So not much atmosphere but you can buy pretty much much what you‚Äôd like to take home. Great central cafe.
ChIJyf8AmOsoQg0RZ3q6VDq7TAo,5,"Review for Jos√© Luis Cervecer√≠a

I had an amazing experience at Jos√© Luis Cervecer√≠a! The service was outstanding‚Äîeveryone was incredibly polite, funny, and attentive, making us feel welcome from the moment we walked in.

The food was absolutely delicious, especially the croquetas, ensaladilla rusa, and the pincho‚Äîeach dish was perfectly made, flavorful, and felt authentically Spanish. And the best part? Everything was reasonably priced, offering great value for such high-quality food.

The ambiance was elegant and classy, making it the perfect spot for a relaxed yet sophisticated dining experience. Whether you‚Äôre stopping by for a quick bite or a long meal with friends, Jos√© Luis Cervecer√≠a is definitely worth a visit. Highly recommended!"
ChIJyf8AmOsoQg0RZ3q6VDq7TAo,1,"Used this place for years - but twice in a week found the service awful.  Four waiters and just a dozen clients. The only way to get attention was to whistle or jump up and down.  Eye contact from the staff was  just between themselves and clearly had important chat as a priority.
Customers just part of the furnishings.   Shame.
Nice place and recently  reformed.  ."
ChIJyf8AmOsoQg0RZ3q6VDq7TAo,4,"Solid service, tasty tapas. The Chupitos and Piemento de Padron were very good, the tortilla espanola well balanced between softness and flavour."
ChIJyf8AmOsoQg0RZ3q6VDq7TAo,5,"Surprise!  My grilled artichoke dish was very different than when you order a grilled artichoke in California and it was also so tasty!   Usually we cut the artichoke in half, wrap in foil for a little bit, and then open and grill with garlic lemon butter.  This artichoke dish was cross cut into flower shapes and grilled.  It was delicious - that said I would cut back on giving it a wash of olive oil at the last second.  Ask for extra lemon.
Ate every last bite.  My husband really enjoyed his hake tacos.  We sat outside and received excellent service.  Our waitress suggested the Tarta de Limon for my husband and I ordered the tarta de chocolate.   I believe my husband got the last piece of Tarta de Limon and Lordy it was good!!!   When you come in, ask if they have any tarta de limon so they can save you a piece.  It is kind of like Lemon Meringue pie with a slight cake texture.  They also have a very nice sit down restaurant inside - we just wanted to sit outside.  It is an upper scale restaurant with superior staff."
ChIJyf8AmOsoQg0RZ3q6VDq7TAo,5,"Great place for a quick lunch , the best tapas!"
ChIJ32mt4JUoQg0RGndoFC5i7DU,5,Delicious cappuccino and lunch! Claudia was great. We always stop by when we‚Äôre in town and it never disappoints. 100% recommend!
ChIJ32mt4JUoQg0RGndoFC5i7DU,5,"Great experience, Croissant con jamon iberico and Almond Croissant super delicious. üëå
Great service from Mercedes!"
ChIJ32mt4JUoQg0RGndoFC5i7DU,2,The coffee and orange juice is fine.   The breakfast avocado toast looked good but the toast is hard as a rock.  The ham and cheese croissant is also mediocre.  Disappointing dishes.
ChIJ32mt4JUoQg0RGndoFC5i7DU,5,"Pasteler√≠a Mallorca is a renowned pastry shop founded in Madrid in 1931 by Bernardino Moreno and Mar√≠a Garc√≠a. Their first shop was established at Bravo Murillo Street No. 7.

In 1949, their children‚ÄîJos√©, Manuel, and Juana‚Äîexpanded the brand by opening a second shop at Vel√°zquez Street No. 59. This location became a cornerstone for the business's growth.

The Vel√°zquez store underwent a complete renovation in 2021, reopening with a bright, modern space that still retains its original structural elements from 1949, such as bricks, beams, steel, and cement.

Today, Pasteler√≠a Mallorca operates multiple locations across Madrid and offers online sales, blending tradition with innovation to cater to modern customer demands."
ChIJ32mt4JUoQg0RGndoFC5i7DU,1,"I recently visited Mallarca, and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing.

First, we waited 10 minutes in line just to get seated. Once we were finally seated, it turned out that 80% of the cakes listed on the menu were unavailable. The service was horrible  (they forgot to provide us with a second set of silverware and not remembering which cakes were available).

We ordered a double coffee, but what we received was just a regular coffee, despite paying for the double portion. The bill was brought out just 3-4 minutes after the food arrived, barely giving us time to start eating.

Overall, the disorganized service, lack of menu availability, and rushed experience left me with no desire to return. For a popular spot, this level of service is unacceptable."
ChIJz9nPqO0oQg0Rc5S7oiterRk,5,"Great service at a very reasonable price. ‚Ç¨14 for lunch for a drink, starter, main, and a dessert. Highly reccomended. Thanks team!"
ChIJz9nPqO0oQg0Rc5S7oiterRk,5,"Cosy with very good service. I had breakfast here, a grilled croissant with marmalade and it was done right."
ChIJz9nPqO0oQg0Rc5S7oiterRk,4,A bit more restaurant for local and quick lunch ......
ChIJz9nPqO0oQg0Rc5S7oiterRk,5,Excellent lunch! Especially if you're staying at the Intercontinental Hotel. 12 Euro for a 3 course meal and the food is on point! Definitely recommend if you're wondering where to eat and not spend an arm and a leg.  Order the solomillo iberico.
ChIJz9nPqO0oQg0Rc5S7oiterRk,5,Excellent service and food. Servered us lunch at our request even though the menu was still set for breakfast.
ChIJZbi1BpIoQg0RZzyyLypITU8,5,"Yesterday evening we had the greatest food experience at Vaqueria Monta√±esa. This restaurant is not located in the city centre, so clearly this is a restaurant for locals.
Beautiful setting, great atmosphere, and very friendly waiter. The waiter did not speak English very well, but this was massively compensated by his friendliness. Overall, with a little help from Google Translate we managed to order and get exactly what we wanted üòä
We started with a beautiful cava brut and some dishes to share as aperitif, the main course was truly  Excellent (with capital), all freshly prepared, tasty, beautifully presented, and accompanied by great wines. Deserts were great as well. Overall, a phantastic gastronomical discovery, strongly recommended!!!"
ChIJZbi1BpIoQg0RZzyyLypITU8,5,"My husband and I had our last dinner in Madrid here.  Wow, we couldn't be happier we did.  The food was amazing and we sure ate a lot of it. We started with the tomato salad, then the aubergine dish and then the chicken and meatball dish. Oh and dessert was off the chart.  We were stuffed but so happy. Everything on the menu sounded so good so we ordered quite a bit of it.  I know Madrid is filled with amazing restaurants but you will definitely want to add this to your list of places to go.  I will forever be a ""favorite"" of ours now.  The restaurant staff couldn't have made us feel more at home and special while we were there.  Every time we go to Madrid, we will add it to the itinerary!"
ChIJZbi1BpIoQg0RZzyyLypITU8,5,"Hands down the best meal we had in Madrid. Would highly recommend. We had the pumpkin, pulpo and chicken. Each bite was better than the last. Highly recommend"
ChIJZbi1BpIoQg0RZzyyLypITU8,4,"This is my third visit and the place is keeping a good standard of quality. They usually introduce new choices so there is a good variety of dishes - specially the fish of the day which is brought straight from the sea! We had croquettes, octopus and fried eggs which were tasty and well cooked."
ChIJZbi1BpIoQg0RZzyyLypITU8,5,"Our server M√°nolo was fantastic. Despite our lackluster attempt of conversing in Spanish, he was very encouraging and patient. We feasted on a 5-way tomato dish, some yummy artichokes, hearty alb√≥ndigas, and a decadent chocolate cake with homemade natural ice cream. As a finale, we tried the f*** me up drink which certainly did no disappoint! Great dining experience. (Pictured in order‚Ä¶
Alcachofas con jamon, Arroz con marinero,  pallarada fina de ternera eco, tomato 5-way, chocolate cake (top) cookie sin complejos (bottom), alb√≥ndigas)"
ChIJ190QQpUoQg0RI2rcMVrTf-I,5,"Coming from Australia and came by to this nice cafeteria. The girls there Jeny and Barbara were very nice and made sure I got my coffee exactly as I wanted (special cappuccino extra creamy), with a very fresh strawberry tart I was not expecting to find such sweet treat.
The girls spoke English to me and made sure I was comfortable and well served. Will be coming back in the future during my mornings in Madrid. :)"
ChIJ190QQpUoQg0RI2rcMVrTf-I,4,"Excellent coffee and delicious bagel. Plenty of pastries, hot and cold food options available. Everything looked fresh and there were.plenty of healthy options.

The staff were very friendly and it was a very relaxed and trendy vibe.

It was affordable, quick and healthy - just what we needed after a 3am start! We would return again if we needed something quick and healthy with a very good caffeine hit!"
ChIJ190QQpUoQg0RI2rcMVrTf-I,5,Indira was amazing we had breakfast there 3 times in four days at Madrid service was amazing the food delicious at a great price and her attention was incomparable definitely recommend it 5 stars because there are not more
ChIJ190QQpUoQg0RI2rcMVrTf-I,1,"Very disappointing experience. The waitress took an age to appear, and when she finally did she walked right past us and took another person's order. He had arrived way after us. My wife's chicken salad was good, but my curried chicken with couscous was terrible - there was no trace of any curry in the dish."
ChIJ190QQpUoQg0RI2rcMVrTf-I,4,"The food quality is really good .. i took the bagle with eggs, it was amazing."
ChIJyf8AmOsoQg0RjOZHNFyeDTY,5,"Great food and service. Do ask for daily special/ staff recommendations, the lubina I had was good and surprisingly not too oily at all."
ChIJyf8AmOsoQg0RjOZHNFyeDTY,5,"My girlfriend and I went to Real Madrid - Rayo Vallecano, our VIP Access was at this restaurant. The food ans service was really good. They kept our luggage during the match so we didn't have to worry about our stuff which was really nice. Tks again."
ChIJyf8AmOsoQg0RjOZHNFyeDTY,4,Had a mid morning bite the tostas are good crab or salmon. Beer and wine selection are decent. Good location for a sunny day the service is also good.
ChIJyf8AmOsoQg0RjOZHNFyeDTY,3,"Everyone raves how phenomenal this place is.  Supposedly the best tapas in Madrid.

I thought it was pretty mediocre at best.  In all fairness, I will give it another try in hopes I was there on an ""off"" night"
ChIJyf8AmOsoQg0RjOZHNFyeDTY,5,Very close to our hotel and the food was excellent.
ChIJLVdZCusoQg0RtNzTxtqVx4c,5,"A nice surprise. I had such a good dinner tonight, much needed after a long haul flight 12x hours:)
Anchoves from North of Spain, Serloin Steak with garlic, and Cholocate cake. So delicous!"
ChIJLVdZCusoQg0RtNzTxtqVx4c,5,"Review for Hevia
My wife and I had a wonderful last-minute lunch at Hevia, and it exceeded all our expectations. From the moment we were greeted at the door to being seated at a beautifully set table, the experience was seamless. The food was absolutely outstanding, bursting with flavor, and the ambiance was both inviting and elegant. To top it off, the service was impeccable‚Äîattentive and warm throughout. Highly recommend visiting Hevia for a memorable dining experience!"
ChIJLVdZCusoQg0RtNzTxtqVx4c,5,"Hevia is my favorite Spanish restaurant in the city. It has all the classic Spanish dishes, and they are always cooked to perfection. Their wine selection is outstanding, and they have a great Gin selection too for the Gin&Tonic lovers. The restaurant has amazing fresh fish, as well as very well cooked meat, so definitely recommended."
ChIJLVdZCusoQg0RtNzTxtqVx4c,5,"I enjoyed the food and the service. This is a typical high end, old school restaurant"
ChIJLVdZCusoQg0RtNzTxtqVx4c,4,"It's definitely a great restaurant. You are very well attended to and the food is varied and sophisticated. However, if you are not accustomed to this sort of fine dining and are just looking for a place to eat in an evening it will probably be a bit intimidating on you and your digestive system. Very expensive and you pay a lot for water (‚Ç¨14.00 for 2 litres) , and the starter they bring without asking."
ChIJFeC5144oQg0RuHOpTUJ3aXg,5,"This is an excellent restaurant at a great price! It will definitely exceed your expectations! First time we landed here was by chance but ever since I can tell that the dining experience remains of high level and quality really matters to the owners! Charming and elegant ambiance, perfectly grilled steaks, attentive and friendly staff, a warm touch and even surprises on the house! Highly recommended for those seeking an unforgettable taste of Argentina."
ChIJFeC5144oQg0RuHOpTUJ3aXg,3,"Was really craving some good meat, so looked this place up while in the area and made a last minute reservation. Maybe I‚Äôm spoiled, having been to Argentina a few times in the past year, but this place left a little something to be desired. It hit the spot in the moment, but not sure I‚Äôd make it one of my regulars.

The salad was really great, but the morcilla wasn‚Äôt very flavorful. The meat was cooked to perfection, but also left me wanting a bit more flavor."
ChIJFeC5144oQg0RuHOpTUJ3aXg,3,Lovely wine to start and little deserts to close but I would not recommend. Too much oil on the artichokes. Too much fat on the chicken Caesar salad. Not the nicest hostess. Annoyed when I needed clarification on the location of the toilet
ChIJFeC5144oQg0RuHOpTUJ3aXg,5,Place is quite good üëåThe steaks are quite tasty and staff very friendly and helpful üôèThere are many choices to eat and must try the deserts üëåStrongly recommended üëç
ChIJFeC5144oQg0RuHOpTUJ3aXg,5,"One of our best meals ever.

We travel internationally throughout the year and are sitting here trying to recall another meal that matched our meal and were having trouble. We were treated like royalty from the moment we sat down: a complementary glass of ros√© Cava, and then pumpkin soup, olives, bread (including gluten free - see photo) with deliciously infused oils for dipping, then our perfectly grilled peppers and artichokes, steak with Rocquefort. We ordered creme caramel and more complementary treats arrived: Greek yogurt with mango and lemon sorbet. Our server suggested a wonderful wine (with Braille enhanced label) and we could not have been happier when the whole thing came in under ‚Ç¨100."
ChIJkf-WopMoQg0R6e0DyIVfqpk,4,"Nice ambience and great services from the staffs. Surprisingly, the food is not that sophisticated.  The duck is not moist enough, very dry. Nice plum sauce for the duck. The most delicious one is the dim sum with foie gras. The food presentation is also great.

It depends on what you are looking for.. the food or the ambience üòÅ"
ChIJkf-WopMoQg0R6e0DyIVfqpk,5,Delicious food with excellent service. Highly recommend
ChIJkf-WopMoQg0R6e0DyIVfqpk,4,"It is a Chinese fine dining restaurant. I liked the beef with the oyster sauce!  The other dishes were ok.

The service is the best!!"
ChIJkf-WopMoQg0R6e0DyIVfqpk,4,"Great Chinese food in an elegant atmosphere,
We like the Peking Duck Menu‚Ä¶the crispy duck pancakes are a highlight!"
ChIJkf-WopMoQg0R6e0DyIVfqpk,5,"We had a wonderful experience here! Excellent food, with amazing service. Highly recommended!"
ChIJpR8EhbcoQg0RG-j_jBFhI0U,5,"We had a wonderful lunch at Milos restaurant. The plates were extremely tasty and very well presented. The service was amazing, very attentive and polite.we really enjoyed it and we will definitely return. The desert ""Galaktopoureko "" was a real delight. We recommend the restaurant 100%"
ChIJpR8EhbcoQg0RG-j_jBFhI0U,4,"Greece in Madrid!
Yummy food, great atmosphere and live band on Thursday!!!
I didn't loved the service because the waitress made me feel a little bit uncomfortable but other than that I would recommend this place"
ChIJpR8EhbcoQg0RG-j_jBFhI0U,5,"Normally I am a fan of greek food and almost every summer I have a greek island visit. This is the first greek restaurant I‚Äôve tried in Madrid, therefore it is not very easy to benchmark it. Even though the food did not feel purely same as in Greece, it was good enough I believe. The service was good, prices were OK. In conclusion Milos is a good option to try greek food."
ChIJpR8EhbcoQg0RG-j_jBFhI0U,5,"Incredible food if you let your self be recommended by the owners, that normally they are at the restaurant. It has everything that a Greek cousin can offer, depending on the area of Milos.
Good atmosphere, they have improved the acoustic and now is much more calm. I have been there 3 times in las 6 months. That is a lot for a person who travels for work."
ChIJpR8EhbcoQg0RG-j_jBFhI0U,5,"Great Greek food, friendly staff"
ChIJ-cFBQccoQg0RjqspaeIpH2I,5,"Our stay at this hotel during our first visit to Madrid for a conference was truly exceptional! The location is fantastic, making it easy to explore the city‚Äôs attractions. We were especially impressed by the outstanding service provided by Raul and Paul. From offering excellent restaurant recommendations to making reservations at local eateries and shops, they went above and beyond to make our stay seamless and enjoyable. They even assisted with carrying our luggage to our room, adding a personal touch that made us feel genuinely welcome. Highly recommend this hotel for its convenient location and incredible staff. Thank you, Raul and Paul, for your warmth and helpfulness"
ChIJ-cFBQccoQg0RjqspaeIpH2I,5,"Went there with some friends for a weekend of concerts at Athletico Madrid stadium.  We choose the hotel because of its proximity to 4 Metro lines for ease of getting to the stadium, other tourist destinations, bus station, cafes and restaurants.
Arrived late on Thurday, nearly 23:00, the reception was well manned and very helpful, as it was throughout our stay.
The rooms were huge for what is normally a business hotel.  The bathroom was well equipped, spacious and clean.  Hairdryer, foot spa, sepate W.C. room and over bath well performing rainfall shower.
The kitchen area included sink, 2 ring hob, fridge, microwave, crockery and utensils for 3x people.  My only critique would be that there wasn't a dishcloth provided so I was unable to wipe down any mess made on the worktop.
The sofa bed in the lounge area was comfortable and there was plenty of wardrobe space for 3x people.
The beds were beautifully made every day, they had the best mattress I've slept on in a hotel and above all they were clean.  The beds were on wheels and this made it a little tricky sitting up in bed, but not impossible.  The TV was 40plus inches and had channels in multiple languages, only BBC world service in English, but that did not matter I wasn't there to watch TV.  The curtains were great at blacking out light, but beware if your partner turns off the master switch, turning off all lights, including the bathroom, it's a long walk round the bed in the middle of the night to switch it back on.
My only other critique is that the Nespresso coffee maker was in the bedroom, thus making it a long walk to the kitchen area for milk.  This was easily solved by moving it to the spacious kitchen cupboard.
The communal areas on the hotel are  very clean and well appointed.  There are 3 lifts which don't all go to every basement level, but this did not present any issues.  The gardens are a nice breakaway area, despite being overlooked by residential buildings.
The area of Salamanca can be explored on foot from the hotel and has a large selection of quality eateries and shops.  Aldi is 5 minutes walk away and can sell you ingredients for the kitchen and coffee machine.
Every interaction we had with the staff was professional and pleasant, more importantly they all seemed to enjoy working there which makes a difference.
All in all a very welcoming and nice experience from the hotel and Madrid."
ChIJ-cFBQccoQg0RjqspaeIpH2I,5,"Modern, affordable hotel with amazing service and very clean rooms. Great attention to detail. Try the room service - you'll love how it's delivered and packaged!

There were multiple power outages due to a boiler that had shorted and the emergency work that followed, but other than that the stay was entirely uneventful. I would choose this place again."
ChIJ-cFBQccoQg0RjqspaeIpH2I,5,"I would recommend this hotel 10/10!

The room is BIG, unlike i am used to in a big city. The location was perfect. Within 2 minutes of the Metro and within walking distance of shopping streets. Futhermore, the service was incredible. Suitcases were carried to the room, free drinks were given when we waited for our taxi and the breakfast crew remembered your kind of coffee and brought it without asking! Especially Arian was incredibly nice. He was genuinely interested in your likings of the city, and incredibly helpfull during the whole stay!"
ChIJ-cFBQccoQg0RjqspaeIpH2I,5,I was attending a workshop. The meeting room facilities were great and the catering was also very tasty with local ingredients!!
ChIJ4ZpF0cYoQg0RnDWkJ6D-XVM,5,"My children picked this restaurant.  They did very well.  All the food, including desserts were excellent.  We started off with the capresse salad.  This had a ball of warm Mozzarella on top of sliced well seasoned tomatoes.   It didn't last long as we each took our portions.  The broken egg and potato with Iberian ham was very different but excellent.  We tried four of the five desserts and now all are gone in a sword fight of spoons trying to get the last taste.  One of the children said, ""dinner here again tomorrow?""  Well worth the time and money."
ChIJ4ZpF0cYoQg0RnDWkJ6D-XVM,4,Nice small location. Good choice of tapas. Very tasty. You should try it. Food for 3 only 60‚Ç¨ incl. Vine and Beer. Friendly service.
ChIJ4ZpF0cYoQg0RnDWkJ6D-XVM,4,Huevos Rotos were great! Good price for what you get. The only thing would be that the service was slow.
ChIJ4ZpF0cYoQg0RnDWkJ6D-XVM,5,"A group of three of us went there for lunch. No reservation but still we were received by a smiling and accommodating hostess. We took the mini omelettes with jam√≥n etc. the croquetas (mixed). It was a perfectly balanced lunch, excellent service, for a fair price. Super!"
ChIJ4ZpF0cYoQg0RnDWkJ6D-XVM,5,"We got tortilla, bao buns, pork crackle, a hamburger and the baileys dessert from here and everything was absolutely delicious. The service was excellent too. This place was an unexpected great find and not expensive for the quality of the food and service."
ChIJTSqPirgoQg0RhI2LrCz9tqg,4,"First time in a Venezuelan restaurant aaaand I loved the food. La chalupa de cerdo described as a Venezuelan lasagna was extremely... delicious!
The place is small and the chairs a bit uncomfortable. The service is OK."
ChIJTSqPirgoQg0RhI2LrCz9tqg,4,"Great service, friendly and attentive staff. Pabellon was tasty though I would have expected more pulled beef. Cachapas and soup were also nice. Teque√±os were not bad but a bit of a disappointment. Will probably return when visiting the area."
ChIJTSqPirgoQg0RhI2LrCz9tqg,4,"Had the menu del dia for 11.5e. Not many options to chose from, but every thing was good"
ChIJTSqPirgoQg0RhI2LrCz9tqg,4,"The food was as expected, so chesy üßÄWhat I like is you can order half portion."
ChIJTSqPirgoQg0RhI2LrCz9tqg,1,We were visiting Madrid from USA. We are Venezuelan. I asked for a barbecue. The meat was so hard to chew that I almost choked myself. The pabell√≥n didn‚Äôt have the Venezuelan flavor. I told the waiter and they apologized for it. They didn‚Äôt charge me for my meal. That was nice.
ChIJ5RhpUMcoQg0RyLgRVluymLM,5,"Excellent service, lovely surroundings and the MOST delicious food. Everyone loved the meal and experience.  Best meal."
ChIJ5RhpUMcoQg0RyLgRVluymLM,5,"Really good food!!!! Like every plate we had was amazing! The service was also great, as the staff where attentive, and interested in what we thought about the food. It was a nice atmosphere, and pretty big areaüòÉ If you like posh restaurants, and your looking for somewhere to eat, I highly recommend this restaurant!!
üíØüíØüíØ"
ChIJ5RhpUMcoQg0RyLgRVluymLM,5,"Amazing quality food! Yes, prices may be a bit steep, but you really pay for quality. Nice menu - wide choice of fish and meat. Also top notch service! I really struggle to understand why this place has been rated so low!"
ChIJ5RhpUMcoQg0RyLgRVluymLM,5,"The food is top, I completely recommend the place‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•"
ChIJ5RhpUMcoQg0RyLgRVluymLM,3,"very good, used to be among the best ... but last time we went they served us a salty 'jamon serrano' supposedly as costly 'jamon ib√©rico', had it returned; terrible blunder; the fish was still very nice"
ChIJk4LeObcoQg0R0b9ZqN9Iq-k,5,"The food here is absolutely delicious, with vibrant flavors and authentic dishes that truly showcase the richness of Indian Subcontinent. The curries are well-spiced, the naan is fresh and soft, and the presentation is top-notch. The ambiance of the restaurant is warm and inviting, and the staff is friendly and attentive.

One suggestion I‚Äôd like to make is to consider adding halal and kosher meat options to the menu. This small addition would make the restaurant more inclusive, allowing a wider range of diners to enjoy this amazing food while adhering to their dietary needs. Overall, a fantastic experience, and I‚Äôd love to come back again!"
ChIJk4LeObcoQg0R0b9ZqN9Iq-k,5,"Tandoori Station is a must-visit Indian restaurant in Madrid. Since it was our first time, we opted for the tasting menu, and it did not disappoint. We were expecting Tikka Masala in our tasting  but were pleasantly surprised with an even better dish‚ÄîButter Chicken. Every bite was delicious, but the standout dishes for us were the rich and flavorful Butter Chicken (also known as the ‚Äúcockroach edict‚Äù) and the perfectly spiced Murgh Ka Tikka appetizer.

The dishes arrived piping hot, and the service was outstanding‚Äîfast, professional, and attentive.

We‚Äôll definitely be back and will be recommending Tandoori Station to friends!"
ChIJk4LeObcoQg0R0b9ZqN9Iq-k,5,"Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve never reviewed, this is THE best restaurant in Madrid. Personally my favourite restaurant period, but everything about this place is first class.

When we lived in Madrid it was a monthly ritual, but when we come back it‚Äôs the first place we go."
ChIJk4LeObcoQg0R0b9ZqN9Iq-k,4,"We had an amazing dinner here. The dal gosht was amazing and we'll definitely come back for more. The meat pieces were so tender. The chicken bhuna was fine, although the spices did not seep into the insides of the chicken pieces. Service was good and very prompt."
ChIJk4LeObcoQg0R0b9ZqN9Iq-k,5,"Food here was fantastic! We sampled a bit of everything on the menu and were amazed with the taste and quality of every dish. Cannot recommend this place enough! The ambience was great, service was quick and attentive, and the food was mouth watering!"
ChIJrcFBKbkoQg0R7CrRD2295aE,5,"I entered quite the hidden gem here in Madrid, it might just be my favourite restaurant ever. A true local haunt, where the vibe is as welcoming as catching up with long lost friends.

Walking in, you're immediately greeted with a sense of familiarity. The kind of familiarity that comes from a place that's been around for decades, where everyone knows each other's names, and the stories shared over crustaceans are the stuff of legend.

And let me tell you, the seafood is nothing short of divine. The kind of seafood that transports you to the shores of Galicia, where the salt in the air is almost tangible, and the sea breeze carries with it the unmistakable scent of fresh fish and lemon.

Now, I must admit, the seating arrangement caught me off guard. No seats? Instead, the owner placed me on a humble pew, a blue box, overlooking the street outside. But you know what? It just adds to the charm of the place. It's as if they've created a time warp, where tradition and modernity collide to form something truly special.

And i can‚Äôt forget about the banter that seemed to be occurring around me, I just wish I knew Spanish so I could join in. But even without understanding the language, the warmth and camaraderie of the patrons and staff is infectious.

All in all, this place has won my heart. It's the kind of spot that makes you feel like you've stumbled upon a secret society, a place where the only requirement for entry is a love of good food, good beer, and good company. A true hidden gem, and one that I'll definitely be returning to."
ChIJrcFBKbkoQg0R7CrRD2295aE,4,Nice place .Has history. Very friendly man serving. It's not for a sit down fish and two veg place. It has a decent variety of sea food all fresh and very tasty. We had Gambas Blancas and Buey de Mar. Not cheap but tasty and to be recommended..
ChIJrcFBKbkoQg0R7CrRD2295aE,5,"S√∫per local place
Amazing seafood, traditional Spanish vibes
Go to eat seafood with your hands"
ChIJrcFBKbkoQg0R7CrRD2295aE,4,"Very typical Spanish shellfish only restaurant. Great food quality but very noisy when busy. When lucky, the big crab ""Buey del Mar"" can be on offer for only 25‚Ç¨ kilo. Just great. Highly recommended."
ChIJrcFBKbkoQg0R7CrRD2295aE,5,"Coolest experience I had in Madrid! The food was incredible, very authentic atmosphere, and the employees were the best!! Muchas gracias!"
ChIJQ0FD074oQg0Rgc5_7z17bmU,5,"The Madrid stew was truly authentic. The portions were huge, the meat was tender and delicious, and the broth was incredibly tasty. The prices were reasonable, and after waiting all summer for it to reopen, it was totally worth it. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back!"
ChIJQ0FD074oQg0Rgc5_7z17bmU,5,"Food was great. I suggest you do a lot of exercise before going so you are starving and enjoy it even more. They serve you a ton and though it may feel pricey, it is worth the price because of all the things included. Please go and treat yourself to a great meal with an iconic dish from Madrid."
ChIJQ0FD074oQg0Rgc5_7z17bmU,5,Amazing experience. Good quality and the service is just outstanding
ChIJQ0FD074oQg0Rgc5_7z17bmU,5,"Very nice and affordable, genuine and rustic Madrid food. Cozy restaurant. Cheap wine with high quality and extremely nice staff."
ChIJQ0FD074oQg0Rgc5_7z17bmU,5,"Amazing experience, the menu is unique and you get an extraordinary meal. It is typically the kind of restaurant the tourists should looking for.

Staff is very king and professional. A lot of list of recommendations at the end of the meal.

But you have to book first if not it's not possible to eat there. And a restaurant where you should book is a sign of quality.

Highly recommended. Will come back for sure !"
ChIJE8uD5LkoQg0Rv8HNhwPkPOM,5,"Great vibes, fresh seafood/shellfish en galor. Staff don't all speak English but that s what makes this place authentic.
Make sure you at happy with the snails and bread they provide you first off as you will be charged for these. The curry was delicious and their specialty crepe desert was delightful!
Only 16min from the airport, worth a stop over before heading in or back."
ChIJE8uD5LkoQg0Rv8HNhwPkPOM,1,"If you DO NOT speak Spanish, steer clear of this restaurant.

We chose this restaurant for our final evening in Madrid, drawn in by its reputation for excellent seafood. While the food was undeniably high quality and reasonably priced by London standards, the service was nothing short of appalling.

From the moment we arrived, the manager‚Äôs attitude was outright hostile.
Despite knowing we didn‚Äôt speak Spanish, he continued addressing us in Spanish, completely ignoring our situation. To make matters worse, an English-speaking waiter stood nearby but was forbidden from assisting us. This led to a humiliating scene, as the manager barked at us in a silent restaurant, making sure every patron could witness the spectacle.

I repeatedly apologized, explaining we didn‚Äôt speak Spanish, yet the manager responded with nothing but impatience and disdain. The discomfort in the room was palpable, and it was only when the waiter, clearly frustrated, finally stepped in to help that we received any semblance of assistance. By then, the damage was done, and our evening was ruined.

While the seafood may be commendable, the disgraceful treatment we endured overshadowed everything. If I could give this restaurant zero stars, I would. If you, like us, don‚Äôt speak Spanish, I strongly urge you to spend your ‚Ç¨200 per head elsewhere‚Äîsomewhere that values basic respect and hospitality.

A deeply infuriating and disappointing end to an otherwise wonderful trip."
ChIJE8uD5LkoQg0Rv8HNhwPkPOM,3,"I clearly agree with the fellow reviewers that food is exquisite BUT the manager is a big problem!

Clearly zero effort to translate or bring someone who speaks English. Came to take our order 40min later because apparently he‚Äôs the only one who takes the orders. Wanted us to order the most expensive  items on the menu. The staff clearly seemed stressed because of many situations happening due to this person.

I really want to come back because it‚Äôs the best fish that anyone can have BUT i won‚Äôt come neither do i recommend it because of this person‚Ä¶ the manager‚Ä¶"
ChIJE8uD5LkoQg0Rv8HNhwPkPOM,5,"Authentic Spanish seafood, definitely a great option. A bit pricey, but worth it. We didn‚Äôt try the main dishes as we were just there for some wine, beer, and a few sharing starters ‚Äî but we‚Äôll definitely go back for a proper dinner. The interior isn‚Äôt pet-friendly, but you can sit outside with your dog. The staff was super friendly and helpful, always with a smile."
ChIJE8uD5LkoQg0Rv8HNhwPkPOM,4,"Some of the freshest and best seafood in the world is served at this modern styled restaurant from Pescader√≠as Coru√±esas group. The raw material is exceptional, the seafood, the fish, their home made smoked salmon, the seasonal products (angulas), etc. Appropriate selection of wines. Unfortunately the service is very dry and inattentive, just focused on dishing out the food and take it away while you are still chewing. If you cannot book a table, the food available at the bar is also excellent."
ChIJQ738PMAoQg0RVNMnuemJKMg,3,"Pretty disappointing for what you expect from price and reputation. Very low value for money. The waiters were too pushy, constantly interrupting our conversation, the decoration and atmosphere were nothing specially, the food was not at all extraordinary with the exception of o e of the 5 dishes we tried, the fresh gambas. I would go there only for that."
ChIJQ738PMAoQg0RVNMnuemJKMg,5,We booked a Christmas dinner here. The  ambiance is intimate and comforting. All the dishes served were excellent! The staff are so warm and friendly. I hope to be back here when I visit Madrid again.
ChIJQ738PMAoQg0RVNMnuemJKMg,5,"Beautiful restaurant! My favorite in madrid so far. Every course we had was even better than the first. The staff were super friendly, we loved that it‚Äôs a family run restaurant by the chef and his wife. Really this was an amazing experience and I recommend anyone that visits Madrid to try it. The shrimp carpaccio was the best carpaccio i have ever had!"
ChIJQ738PMAoQg0RVNMnuemJKMg,5,"Jet lagged, I was not yet on Spanish time, but this lovely small restaurant was open early.  Gracious service, surprising but excellent food, every course. Cozy elegant dining room."
ChIJQ738PMAoQg0RVNMnuemJKMg,5,"Very good Andalucia style food - had the tasting menu which was very good. However a tad on the fishy and salty side, missed some ham.
They have a formidable wine selection at very fair prices.
Highly recommended."
ChIJC0brYbgoQg0RLcpVrA6llaU,5,"Superb tortilla espa√±ola. Perfect texture, runny. Not too salty. Lovely caramelized onions that give it a slightly crispy texture ‚Äî 10/10!

Also be sure to try their unique cheesecake ‚Äî light and fluffy almost like a mousse!"
ChIJC0brYbgoQg0RLcpVrA6llaU,1,"We found this place to be a good stop for a local Spanish breakfast (omelette). The food was good, but the staff were extremely rude and impolite. In the end, they served us a piece of toast that had already been eaten. I asked for another piece, and they brought us one that was clearly torn by hand‚Äù possibly from another customer‚Äôs portion‚Äùsince it should have been cut with a bread cutter. Thanks for ruining the start of our morning, lol"
ChIJC0brYbgoQg0RLcpVrA6llaU,5,"Everything we ordered was AMAZING
Best dishes: tartare, merluza, oxtail, cheesecake, tapas!

Food was served fast, but service was mid, our waiter looked over many tables, so it took a long time for waiter to come to us."
ChIJC0brYbgoQg0RLcpVrA6llaU,5,"Excellent place to stop in for tapas! Fresh pinchos made with high quality ingredients available at the bar. There are seats available for those who arrive early enough. The food, the atmosphere and the service are all top. Highly recommend!"
ChIJC0brYbgoQg0RLcpVrA6llaU,4,"The is amazingly tasteful.
Why a 4 and not a 5 star as when I had the super good hake, it was presented only with some really tasteful tomatoes.
The fish felt lonely on the plate.
For the price 55 euro a person for a lunch !  they should do a much better presentation!"
ChIJ01j1W7coQg0RW31s0s0qgCY,3,"Good: Loved the clams and the mixed fried fish selection. Also the cold white wines were nice. It is in a nice part of town.

Less good: they took so much time between plates! we were a couple and ordered 3 plates to share, it took so long to go from one to the next (with long waiting time in between) that we run out of bread and drinks and we were not even hungry when the 3rd one came.

Bad: The grilled octopus was so overpriced! look at the picture, we paid 20 euros for *one* tentacle split by half, the rest were veggies.

Good to get drinks and maybe some of the fried fish to share. Less good to try to get a sit down dinner, due to the high price and the long waiting times."
ChIJ01j1W7coQg0RW31s0s0qgCY,5,"I‚Äôll be taking all friends and family who visit to Cazorla.  My son is going to love it, too.  From the lovely location to the service to the exceptional quality of the food: Amazing.  The best calamari and boquerones that I‚Äôve had in years.  Just wow."
ChIJ01j1W7coQg0RW31s0s0qgCY,5,"One of the best restaurant in Madrid ! Food, service, atmosphere: everything is an amazing and the value for money cannot be better. Strongly recommended!"
ChIJ01j1W7coQg0RW31s0s0qgCY,4,Very Good spanisch cuisine to an acceptable price. Terrace also very nice to sit outside. We will definitely come again.
ChIJ01j1W7coQg0RW31s0s0qgCY,5,"Very nice place in Madrid, excellent food at affordable prices, in fact, appetizers alone will fill you. Good service and nice liquors on the house at the end. Recommended!"
ChIJIwaGN7goQg0RQa6_781nUAw,5,The food was sooo good. one of the best pizza's i've had in a while. Def would recommend for everyone 10/10
ChIJIwaGN7goQg0RQa6_781nUAw,5,"Domino's Pizza is similar to what you‚Äôd find anywhere else. Just don‚Äôt expect the workers to speak English. The best pizza is the Pepperoni, called Tony Pepperoni. The great news is that Domino‚Äôs in Spain now uses the same pepperoni as in other locations."
ChIJIwaGN7goQg0RQa6_781nUAw,5,"For a place in which you can just get decent food for your buck, and drink as much as you want with Friends(soda that is) it can't really get any better

The place is usually filled with teenagers due to the 'all you can eat' being a fair price, but that aside, the staff is wonderfully nice and the food is as good as it can get"
ChIJIwaGN7goQg0RQa6_781nUAw,1,"They are really rude. I order my pizza in app and going there, they even don‚Äôt start to prepare and telling me ‚Äòwill be ready in 2 minutes‚Äô and of course lying and I am waiting more than 15 minutes"
ChIJIwaGN7goQg0RQa6_781nUAw,1,Marks food as delivered well before delivery in order to improve their internal metrics. Avoid this branch. Food took an hour and a half.
ChIJNytIwL8oQg0RlhrJQBmQcgU,4,"I was positively impressed by the quality of the food and of the presentations considering that we went there as a large group something always hard to deal with (we were in fact over 30 people).

The croquettes were particularly tasty and the tomatoes seemed high quality.

I found the paella a bit disappointing, especially considering that the restaurant seems specialized in that. I opted for the seafood one, which is usually very rich and instead mine had a bland taste. I also couldn't find any sign of the crust that normally forms on top.

A couple of other guests seemed to share my opinion on the rice.

Service was super attentive."
ChIJNytIwL8oQg0RlhrJQBmQcgU,4,"Their Juan Bravo establishment has never disappointed me and all rice dishes I have tried were excellent in flavour, quality of ingredients, quantity of portions and cooking point. Very good appetizers, especially the daily and seasonal specials. Service can be a bit choppy depending on who is responsible for your table (hence my 3 stars rating on this aspect).
Update on January 2025: another classic establishment that starts to fall prey to the new wave of Barrio de Salamanca consumers. Food quality and service has deteriorated and prices increased. Also the rice offers have adapted to these new trends. Still a very good place but for how long?"
ChIJNytIwL8oQg0RlhrJQBmQcgU,4,"Last time we came we were in the terrace this time we were in the dinning room,. The oysters were stunning, the artichokes with crab and croquettes were delicious. I think we chose the wrong rice, we had a rice Alicantino with rabbit and chickpeas, it was a little dry and not as tasty as I expected. I recommend eating on the terrace."
ChIJNytIwL8oQg0RlhrJQBmQcgU,5,"Hands down the best arroceria in Madrid. Exceptional service, fabulous food, and a wonderful wine list. Highly recommend the alcachofas stuffed with txangurro and of course their paella - particularly arroz marisco or arroz negro con sepia."
ChIJNytIwL8oQg0RlhrJQBmQcgU,4,"Good service, even though the server does speak any English. seafood Paella is good but not great. We come to dine with high expectations but it left a lot to desire"
ChIJpzmi5-ooQg0Re1HNYe1kh2g,5,"Their side dishes were fresh and tasty. Their sangria was wonderful! If you‚Äôre a fan of lamb their roasted lamb was amazing and you can watch it being roasted! (I would even recommend you to try it here - get the 1/2 quarter - as it is prepared in a way that the lamb doesn‚Äôt have that strong ‚Äúsheep flavor.‚Äù) Their roasted pork was also very good and a good alternative if you don‚Äôt eat lamb!

We got biscuits and sweet wine on the house afterwards and it was a delightful treat.

Staff was patient and kind towards us non-native speakers. Thank you for the experience!"
ChIJpzmi5-ooQg0Re1HNYe1kh2g,5,"simplicity meets perfection. Their oven-roasted lamb, slow-cooked over a wood fire, is nothing short of spectacular. The skin crisps up beautifully, while the meat stays tender and full of rich, natural flavor‚Äîno heavy seasoning, just pure, high-quality lamb done right."
ChIJpzmi5-ooQg0Re1HNYe1kh2g,5,i will never forget this tasty beef ‚Ä¶ everything was great and you must make reservations
ChIJpzmi5-ooQg0Re1HNYe1kh2g,4,"Great restaurant for the roasted lamb - lechazo asado. All you need is a salad, roasted peppers and wine. Maybe some jamon iberico. Highly recommended"
ChIJpzmi5-ooQg0Re1HNYe1kh2g,5,"Walked in for dinner and luckily they were able to accommodate us. The roast lamb was superb, one of the best I‚Äôve ever tried. The cochinilio wasn‚Äôt available unfortunately.

Price was decent and not too expensive. Enjoyed this dinner very much."
ChIJ0xDmyL4oQg0RFkXxgiVweF4,5,Located in one of the best areas in Madrid. Delicious Galician food. Great wines. Absolutely amazing service. Highly recommended.
ChIJ0xDmyL4oQg0RFkXxgiVweF4,5,It's a small and simpatical place. The service was good and the food delicious.  Big choice of seafood
ChIJ0xDmyL4oQg0RFkXxgiVweF4,5,The sea food was amazing! I will come again as there are a lot of good fish to try. The service is fast and nice too.
ChIJ0xDmyL4oQg0RFkXxgiVweF4,3,"We were 3 to go on the terrace to have some drinks.
No one was there to welcome us, so we decided with my friends, to move one chair from another table to seat in a table of 2, since all the other clients did the same.
The waitress arrived very pissed and mad at us for moving a chair and told us that we‚Äôre not allowed to move chairs etc, while literally all the other clients were group of 3 as well and they had to move chairs to seat together.
Very bad experience to start of.
Thanks god, the drinks that we ordered were really good and we had a good time eventually"
ChIJ0xDmyL4oQg0RFkXxgiVweF4,5,"Looking for Galician restaurant in Madrid we chose this one and it was right choice. First of all I want to highlight the service, although there was a table of bug group of people, we were served timely.
And of course food is exceptional, we got some starters (you can ask for half portion) and rice with shrimps - very good one, not heavy, a bit liquid (there is pepper inside).

There is terrace (not with plastic seats anymore), so it is very Spanish atmosphere.

Highly recommended üëåüèª"
ChIJ8wQupL4oQg0RnQbsc2t4F4c,5,"This is an incredible Japanese restaurant found in Madrid, having been to Japan myself this place mirrors most that experience to all i have been in the city thus far. Highly recommended, especially on Mondays and Fridays for the day menu."
ChIJ8wQupL4oQg0RnQbsc2t4F4c,3,"Good product and good service. It is not the trendy place that now are proliferating, but you can eat good sushi, nigiri and different Japanese food."
ChIJ8wQupL4oQg0RnQbsc2t4F4c,3,"Disappointing.  Makis were stale, rice was undercooked,  , no miso soup in the menu, appetizer consisted of a few cold and brownish edamame pods , place was nearly empty at 10 PM and has no atmosphere. All around a mediocre restaurant."
ChIJ8wQupL4oQg0RnQbsc2t4F4c,5,Probably the best Sushi place in Madrid. It is not cheap but worth every euro.
ChIJ8wQupL4oQg0RnQbsc2t4F4c,5,"Just awesome. Key elements for success: freshness, taste, but no extravagant exageration like you may find in typical eateries.

Oh, and don't shy away from the ceviche lime√±o... Best in my life."
ChIJJfXxSkspQg0R1M4PGpJDzsY,5,Quaint and authentic little tapas bar. The two dishes I had (squid and solomillo) were both sublime
ChIJJfXxSkspQg0R1M4PGpJDzsY,5,"El Almirez is an excellent little restaurant that serves tapas style food in larger portions for sharing. Fair prices, very nice staff and excellent flavors."
ChIJJfXxSkspQg0R1M4PGpJDzsY,4,"Simple tasty food away from the madding crowd.

The pinchos are tasty, we shared them all, one of each, add two dishes from the ""Para picar"" section and that will be plenty for two, the dishes from the main menu looked promising but they will be for others to judge.

We had cod (bacalao) in pisto and veal (ternera) meatballs, all very tasty.

No tourists here so come prepared to eat real Spanish food as the locals like it."
ChIJJfXxSkspQg0R1M4PGpJDzsY,4,"Food was overall pretty good. Came here after finding a discount online and most of it was good. However, they don't get the 5th star since the staff made us feel that because of the offer we had to accept certain things. Smaller portions, overpriced drinks (seriously, 3.5‚Ç¨ for a 20cl coke bottle?)."
ChIJJfXxSkspQg0R1M4PGpJDzsY,5,Great food and excellent customer service. We got 50% discount on a la carte menu. Otherwise it would have been a bit too expensive.
ChIJf6XfMLgoQg0RGH7EGJCOciY,5,Love this local british pub‚Ä¶ just found it and have amazing beers and good atmosphere
ChIJf6XfMLgoQg0RGH7EGJCOciY,3,"Such a shame that the muscle bound waiter was so rude towards non Spanish speaking clientele. Forcing patrons to order off a website with no physical menu and no consideration for tourists.  Overall, the food was great, the staff inside were lovely, but the outside waiter ruined my evening."
ChIJf6XfMLgoQg0RGH7EGJCOciY,4,"Calamares were ok, beer as well, pi√±a colada was awful - don't order it - lots of crushed ice in the glass and it did not taste anything like pi√±a colada. Since it's a beer house, which hints that coctails might not be their strongest side, I downgrade the score only by one star."
ChIJf6XfMLgoQg0RGH7EGJCOciY,5,"Lovely place, nice service, had a set lunch menu, very good value. Waiter suggested the 'bombon' coffee and it was a nice treat. Recommend for lunches, solo, tourists."
ChIJf6XfMLgoQg0RGH7EGJCOciY,4,"A good old bar in barrio Salamanca, to have Spanish breakfast, or a couple of drinks. Friendly staff, good location. Usually very crowded in the evenings."
ChIJ4avwGLooQg0Rc6oND7hFFU8,5,"Perfect food, perfect environment.
I will recommend all of u to come"
ChIJ4avwGLooQg0Rc6oND7hFFU8,3,"Nice atmosphere, fresh seafood, very crean but all dishes had kind of same taste. Olive oil, salt... nothing special and no originality then I would recommend to cook yourself in your house because it was not special at all.
It‚Äôs shame but I wouldn‚Äôt come back.
You can find same taste quority of food much cheaper in other restaurant."
ChIJ4avwGLooQg0Rc6oND7hFFU8,3,"Delicious salmon salad as a starter and tasty octopus Galician style.  However my wife‚Äôs hake was served without its lime sauce and saut√©ed spinach.  Elements of good service during our meal but also some disappointing service which I would not expect ; I had to remind the waiters three times about mineral water ordered initially with our wine. Also I, and two other customers, had to request for the restaurant front door to be closed on a cold evening."
ChIJ4avwGLooQg0Rc6oND7hFFU8,3,"The white Gambas are really good! Also a nice selection of wines, with very reasonable prices (4.25‚Ç¨ per glass)
The service is the worst tho, you won‚Äôt get a single smile from one of the waiters. That is , if they even talk to you. Sometimes they‚Äôll just ignore you and not care that you are there"
ChIJ4avwGLooQg0Rc6oND7hFFU8,5,Very good Spanish food and service.  Octopus is their speciality.
ChIJkxzJ5skoQg0RDcLhWHmhX-s,5,We had a fantastic dinner and our only complaint was that were¬†were served¬†too much food! We opted for the tasting menu featuring delicious dishes served in substantial portions. The highlight was the service - experienced staff made everything appear effortless despite the packed restaurant (an encouraging mix of locals and tourists). Our meal was complemented by two bottles of wine - their house white followed by an excellent red that we thoroughly enjoyed. Highly recommend it for both the quality of food and professional service.
ChIJkxzJ5skoQg0RDcLhWHmhX-s,5,This is a wonderful high end restaurant with a phenomenal staff. The cod fritters are an absolute must. I also loved my seafood lasagna. And of course the cheesecake was delicious. Thank you Samy for being the perfect server and making us feel so welcomed. Thank you Anthony for translating. Do not skip this place!
ChIJkxzJ5skoQg0RDcLhWHmhX-s,5,"Los Montes de Galicia is an absolute gem! My wife and I recently dined here and had a wonderful experience from start to finish. We ordered the sole, which was not only delicious but also generously portioned‚Äîbig enough for both of us to share. In fact, we ended up splitting everything, and even if we hadn‚Äôt, the prices were so reasonable that it would have been a great value either way.

The menu offers a fantastic selection of traditional Galician dishes, each bursting with authentic flavors and beautifully presented. The seafood, especially the sole, was fresh and expertly prepared‚Äîtruly a highlight of the meal.

A special mention goes to Anthony Acevedo, the Director General, whose dedication and passion are evident in every detail, from the quality of the food to the attentive and friendly service. It‚Äôs clear that his leadership helps make Los Montes de Galicia such a special place.

One thing that really stood out to us was how the restaurant‚Äôs energy picked up later in the evening. Around 9 PM, the crowd started rushing in, creating a lively and vibrant atmosphere that made the experience even more enjoyable.

Whether you‚Äôre celebrating a special occasion or just enjoying a night out, I highly recommend Los Montes de Galicia for anyone looking to experience the best of Galician cuisine in a welcoming and reasonably priced setting!"
ChIJkxzJ5skoQg0RDcLhWHmhX-s,5,"Stepping into Montes de Galicia feels like stumbling upon a hidden gem in Madrid‚Äôs endless labyrinth‚Äîone of those rare moments when travel stops being about sightseeing and becomes an intimate, sensory revelation. I've wandered across Europe's landscapes countless times, each journey a fresh page, but Spain, Spain has always whispered louder, pulled harder, made promises it consistently delivered on.

Montes de Galicia wasn‚Äôt just another dining stop; it was a rendezvous with culinary greatness. Ricardo and Alex treated us like long-lost friends, guiding us through an experience that was both deeply personal and flawlessly professional. Their hospitality was a lesson in genuine warmth.

But let‚Äôs cut to the chase‚Äîthe food, because that‚Äôs where Montes de Galicia carves its name into your memory. Now, octopus and I‚Äîwe're old acquaintances, a dish I know well, a plate I encounter at least two or three times a month. Yet, here I found octopus redefined. Lightly smoked, incredibly tender, each bite whispered stories of the sea, smoky embers, and Galician authenticity. Hands down, the best I've ever tasted.

Then there was the ham‚ÄîSpain‚Äôs pride, the Iberian masterpiece that melted on my tongue, disappearing into an impossibly delicious memory. Rich, buttery, sensual‚Äîit was a revelation, the kind of taste that lingers long after the last bite.

Montes de Galicia isn't merely a place to dine; it's a vivid reminder of what travel, food, and human connection are all about. Do yourself a favor: come hungry, stay curious, leave changed."
ChIJkxzJ5skoQg0RDcLhWHmhX-s,5,We had checked the website and seen there was a special menu. This includes a selection of 6 starter's to share. We had expected these to be a small selection -It is not!! We went wondering how we would survive the mains. We did ans these were just as gorgeous. Dessert - are you joking!! We still managed a lemon posset ( lemon sorbet but even lighter) and a piece of vanilla cheesecake which was light as air! Finished off with coffee ‚òï Did I mention wine is included in the set price!! ‚Ç¨100 pp two with at least two. Wine shared - white and a red between two any not finished taken home. Amazing option. Thanks again to Samy who served us and was fab!!!
ChIJ5wI1Y7QoQg0RU0Da822H30o,3,"Cozy place and seems like no need to reserve. The service was excellent. As for the food, it was just average. The only standout dish was the pulpo ala galleta, which was very soft and flavorful! Other okay options are the ox tail croquette and the chulletilas (fried lamb).

The mixed paella was way bigger than expected and lacked taste. We ordered 2 portions but it can easily serve 4-5 people. The seafood they used were very tiny lobsters and crab legs with no meat at all. üò¢

Other orders were unremarkable: callos, huevos salsa de rabo (ox tail sauce with fries), sopa marisco (seafood soup), beans, and ox tail meatball (good taste but too mushy for my liking)."
ChIJ5wI1Y7QoQg0RU0Da822H30o,5,"Our dinner experience was excellent. Our waitress, Elizabeth, was very attentive and welcoming. We asked her to guide us for our dinner options, and she immediately suggested the house specialty: rabo de toro, along with a cachopo asturiano for the main courses. For an appetizer she offered molleja, and a tinto de verano with a sangria for drinks. The drinks came promptly, along with bread and olives. Then the mollejas came out sizzling and were a great start to the dinner. Elizabeth later brought the main dishes which were more savory than we expected.  Throughout dinner, Elizabeth checked in on us to make sure we weren‚Äôt lacking of anything. Dessert was also a recommendation from Elizabeth, a warm tarta tatin de manzana with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, then Elizabeth brought us a couple of waters to balance out the dessert sweetness - a great finish to our dinner.
Definitely recommend Timbales, and ask for Elizabeth if you want to have an awesome dinner experience."
ChIJ5wI1Y7QoQg0RU0Da822H30o,3,"Very average. It's positioned well, next to the bullring, but that often means that due to the high volume of people, the quality and service is lower.
The waiters I had weren't very nice, and automatically talk to you in English as if you were a tourist. I won't be going again. It's basically a tourist bar."
ChIJ5wI1Y7QoQg0RU0Da822H30o,5,Very friendly and helpful service with both English speaking and Spanish staff. Good recommendations and helpful. Food was very good. Steak and chips were cooked to perfection and a decent portion. My wife loved the paella which they were happy to help us takeaway as its a two person portion.
ChIJ5wI1Y7QoQg0RU0Da822H30o,4,I can say that it‚Äôs normal restaurant. Ordered seafood paella and it was average taste.
ChIJkROXUrEoQg0RGXKMIAl2Obc,5,"Very nice and helpful staff. Thank you for the complementary snacks and liquor shots!
Definitely recommend"
ChIJkROXUrEoQg0RGXKMIAl2Obc,5,Great authentic Andalusian experience! Dishes were hearty and portions were great! Great service and atmosphere too!
ChIJkROXUrEoQg0RGXKMIAl2Obc,5,"We went for dinner to this amazing restaurant, the best fish you can find in Madrid centro, it was super fresh and good quantity, you can ask dishes to share because they give good portions for groups, the food very well prepared, we made a reservation but if you go on Sunday there‚Äôs no need because there were empty tables, the attention was very fast and very attentive, I recommend a lot this place, plus there are many other restaurants from the same chain around."
ChIJkROXUrEoQg0RGXKMIAl2Obc,4,"Food is good but too little, you end up hungry. They charge you for the bread that they put as a welcome. The waiter pushes for you to order more food. The pulpo a la Gallega was really small. More potatoes than Octupus. Not worth 22 Euros. The navajas are not worth it either. The best is the chipirones and the Rodaballo is also good"
ChIJkROXUrEoQg0RGXKMIAl2Obc,4,"Amazing dining experience, great ambience."
ChIJw0sMWrgoQg0RunCVFxHHXCo,4,"Good place for drinks - they're cheap. Otherwise, my sea bass was quite small and full of bones. The salad and mashed potatoes were nice. It's a good place for big groups - you can all sit in the outbuilding next to the road. The waiter didn't speak English and there was no drinks menu."
ChIJw0sMWrgoQg0RunCVFxHHXCo,5,"We visited Bulevar 54 with my wife. We love this place because of the people that manage it and the amazing food.
We had been visiting this place since 2019 and every time it is better. We recommend to grab the daily menu as food is fresh and daily made. Chicken ‚Äúescalope‚Äù and Alubias are highly recommended."
ChIJw0sMWrgoQg0RunCVFxHHXCo,5,"Food was delicious, the lunch menu for 13.5 ‚Ç¨ is very good and value for money"
ChIJw0sMWrgoQg0RunCVFxHHXCo,5,"Good Menu del dia, plenty of choices for starter, main course and dessert, good flavours, tasty and quick service."
ChIJw0sMWrgoQg0RunCVFxHHXCo,1,Do yourself a huge favour and avoid this place at all costs. There‚Äôs a Domino‚Äôs on the corner that will cost less and taste 100x better
ChIJQ0Mr38coQg0RNjAjucCFyeg,5,"Great service, awesome food, good experience overall. I would suggest to go easy with the music volume inside the restaurant because sometimes we struggled to hear each other out during dinner but when it comes to the rest of the experience 10/10. Great Chicken Tikka Masala, The cheese naan was on point and the butter chicken was VERY tasty. The carrot cake at the end was a gold brochure. 100% recommend"
ChIJQ0Mr38coQg0RNjAjucCFyeg,5,Amazing service! The food is superb - especially the Butter Chicken. What a great little hidden gem. If I could give 10 stars I would!
ChIJQ0Mr38coQg0RNjAjucCFyeg,4,Good Indian food. All we ordered was good.
ChIJQ0Mr38coQg0RNjAjucCFyeg,5,"Visited this restaurant once for lunch and once for dinner. On both occasions the food was incredible. We tried the chicken tandoori, chicken madras, plain rice, pilau rice, naan breads and more. The service was brilliant too."
ChIJQ0Mr38coQg0RNjAjucCFyeg,5,"Personally, the food was really good. Their Panak paneer is amongst the best I've had in Madrid. Their rice and naan as well. Their mango chicken was very tasty, but the chicken itself a tad dry. With thefork promotion it became the best bang for your buck indian food imo. Even without the promotion, i'd feel content to return."
ChIJ6byclrQoQg0Rvn-bI52gAVQ,4,"I had the beef milanese with truffle sauce and pouche egg which comes with a salad and a creamy boil potato on mushroom sauce.

Dish was nice but a little pricy for the region (EU19) which I had with the lemonade that was quite good !"
ChIJ6byclrQoQg0Rvn-bI52gAVQ,2,"Served underprepared garlic and waiter tried to pass it off as intentional, had to dice and skin it ourselves (see image). Not impressed by the service either"
ChIJ6byclrQoQg0Rvn-bI52gAVQ,5,"It was busin busin.No cap, It was giving"
ChIJ6byclrQoQg0Rvn-bI52gAVQ,5,Good italian food at reasonable prices. Staff were friendly and service was quick. Restaurant was not too crowded.
ChIJ6byclrQoQg0Rvn-bI52gAVQ,3,"Usual Ginos experience, which is good food for a very decent price, but this location has no windows and no natural light. Easy to access for wheelchairs."
ChIJ6byclrQoQg0RMQej9dkML8I,4,"This is the first time we entered a VIPS in several years and it seems that quality has improved quite a lot. Nice, good dishes, friendly prices and even friendly service.
Good place for simple food without emptying your wallet."
ChIJ6byclrQoQg0RMQej9dkML8I,4,This restaurant chain always becomes a safe bet when you want to eat well and not excessively expensive. Supreme chicken doesn't reach ten euros. I ordered the small beer rod but it was 3‚Ç¨ big. They take care of you quickly and are very attentive. To always come back
ChIJ6byclrQoQg0RMQej9dkML8I,3,It's a quick family spot and does what it does ok. Tuscano salad was good...asked for my burger medium but it was raw and just had to say something. The fix was quick though I will say.
ChIJ6byclrQoQg0RMQej9dkML8I,3,Standard Quality VIPS food. Unfortunately the service was very slow even though the restaurant was empty.
ChIJ6byclrQoQg0RMQej9dkML8I,2,"Uhm you cannot serve me a salad without oil and salt. And when asked for oil and salt bring just the oil. And when re-asked only bring a topping more (sauce?).
Overall, food is average. And service is decent."
ChIJieSQuckoQg0RG6yhbjg4s48,5,"All the Fridays we are there, me and my friends, it's a peasant place to reunite the group and to have beautiful moments. The food is delicious and the staff is wonderful! I recommend it 100%."
ChIJieSQuckoQg0RG6yhbjg4s48,4,"there was no english menu and no one can speak english, i had to use google translator to check the foods and at the end I didn't get what I ordered. in the other hand, the price was reasonable and we've got big plate of food for each person."
ChIJieSQuckoQg0RG6yhbjg4s48,4,Cute bar in a tiny neighbourhood with a lovely staff. Friday night is definitely the time when you should try to go there. Pretty calm the other days. Only thing : tapas are cold when they are served 50% of the time..
ChIJieSQuckoQg0RG6yhbjg4s48,5,We stayed nearby Fresno for a long weekend for the European cup final and the Fresno became our local the hospitality was amazing and the staff and locals treated us as one of there own all of us who went to Fresno will never forget there kindness and hospitality thanks again to you all and maybe no not defo we will see you all again from all the liverpool lads
ChIJieSQuckoQg0RG6yhbjg4s48,5,"Nice place for eating and having a drink
Food is quite cheap"
ChIJrxLoz7soQg0RLlsrpsloqtA,5,"We went on a peaceful night so the food and service were quick! We found a table which can be hard to do at a 100 montaditos. It was also Wednesday so everything we ordered ended up being 15.50 euros! GREAT VALUE! I had a great time. I will say I think they water down the drinks because they serve you a huge mug but you can barely taste the alcohol. That‚Äôs not the biggest deal for me though, that was easy to look past:) GET THE FRIES!"
ChIJrxLoz7soQg0RLlsrpsloqtA,4,"Very friendly and cosy place. The person at the cashier offered us the English menu. The buns are crispy and good, in particular the pulled pork. Chicken wings are a tad too salty for our liking. Cheese pops are nice. The price of the items are between 1-2 Euros. Drinks are cheap and good."
ChIJrxLoz7soQg0RLlsrpsloqtA,2,"For the price it‚Äôs alright but honestly it‚Äôs tasteless and a little overdone. feels a lot like a train station inside, not the one for a relaxing lunch!

Service 3/5
Quality 2/5

ChIJrxLoz7soQg0RLlsrpsloqtA,4,"I just got a drink, which was good. I recommend the Tinto de verano, which was 2 euros. Line wasn‚Äôt that long to purchase the drink. The only thing that bothered me was the noise level. The bar is slightly small, so when crowded it is very loud."
ChIJrxLoz7soQg0RLlsrpsloqtA,3,"Veeeery cheap, good value. However, there was a cochroach running on our table."
ChIJwz1ezLAoQg0RLBZS6_MkDJU,5,"Great food, they have examples of the dishes on display, which makes it easier to choose. You get 3 dishes/soups on your plate for one price. Very flavorful food and kind staff. Highly recommended!"
ChIJwz1ezLAoQg0RLBZS6_MkDJU,5,"Great food.  From what I could see on the menu it was Persian/Arab/turkish food which for breakfast means eggs, yogurts, bread, eggplant, peppers, hummus (chickpeas), tahini and so forth. The flavours were great, fresh and filling.  You should try it"
ChIJwz1ezLAoQg0RLBZS6_MkDJU,5,Easily one of my favourite restaurants. The menu is so fresh and fun. It offers a  fusion of traditional Irannian dishes with a mix of other cultures.
ChIJwz1ezLAoQg0RLBZS6_MkDJU,5,"The food is amazing, lot of variety and really good quality-price. Many different types of rices combined with legumes, vegetables and meats. The desserts are also really good, and the lemonade is a must."
ChIJwz1ezLAoQg0RLBZS6_MkDJU,4,"The food is amazing! You can choose 3 dishes for 15,95 and they‚Äôll be served to you quickly on one plate. Baklava is to die for! But I put 4 because the restaurant lacked of atmosphere. Everything is done too fast and without a proper attention to the customer. It‚Äôs just running and rushing. We felt uncomfortable and that employees would prefer us to eat and leave fast then enjoy the food and share the new cuisine discovery."
ChIJq6ruILEoQg0Rvgtwy1bpVzM,4,"Nice coffee shop and salad or sandwiches for quick lunch break during business days , very friendly staff and great green tea"
ChIJq6ruILEoQg0Rvgtwy1bpVzM,1,"Came here for a quick breakfast. The food itself was fine, but the service was extremely poor. The server who assisted us, a female staff member, was quite rude in her interactions with us. When I attempted to ask her a question, she responded with a heavy sigh, displaying obvious annoyance and a lack of customer service."
ChIJq6ruILEoQg0Rvgtwy1bpVzM,5,"First time at Rodilla and a 5 star service well deserved. Great service from staff, great food and amazing atmosphere. Had some hot drinks and they were professionally made, it was lovely. Highly recommended!!"
ChIJq6ruILEoQg0Rvgtwy1bpVzM,2,It's costly. A half sandwich is 1.60 euros and a cafe 2.40. At Vivari and other cafes you will get coffee for 1.70 - 1.80 and choco Napolitano for 1.20 euros.
ChIJq6ruILEoQg0Rvgtwy1bpVzM,5,"If you go to Rodilla try the turkey with apple sandwich! It's the best,it's my favourite snack! They have this offer called merienda ....2 sandwiches and a drink for 3,50!! Great place always!!"
ChIJY7stOLcoQg0RClIhbsGm_1g,5,"Come here if you can.  The smash burguers are great, full of flavor and juicy.  Fries were awesome too but don't travel well, unless you can air fry them."
ChIJY7stOLcoQg0RClIhbsGm_1g,4,"This burger food truck is a revelation. The quality of the ingredients is exceptional and the variety of options is impressive. The service is fast and friendly, and the atmosphere is fun and lively. Don't miss their famous wagyu beef burger! 9.5/10 recommended!"
ChIJY7stOLcoQg0RClIhbsGm_1g,5,"Pretty fast service, burgers were amazing, wouldn‚Äôt reccomend the salad it wasn‚Äôt very good."
ChIJY7stOLcoQg0RClIhbsGm_1g,4,"Hamburger was ok , a bit undercooked despite requesting it medium well. There are definitely better burgers out there, but this one is in a convenient location with friendly service . Perfect for a quick lunch"
ChIJY7stOLcoQg0RClIhbsGm_1g,1,"It's really not pleasant when you bite a piece of bone in your hamburger, and its even worst when you take 2. With the number of hamburger restaurant in a city like Madrid is just not worth it. Respectfully I leave this message so they can make amendments to their processes, the main component if their business is meat, you gotta do it better"
ChIJ6X_MG7EoQg0RrbHW-MYVflg,5,"Excellent food, extraordinary service, great value for the money. Our waiter Georgian went out of his way to keep patrons happy and well served."
ChIJ6X_MG7EoQg0RrbHW-MYVflg,4,We visited this place to drink something before eating at another restaurant. The place is nice. It gets very crowded
ChIJ6X_MG7EoQg0RrbHW-MYVflg,5,"The burger was super tasty, chips wasn't and I choose Fanta to drink and the glass came with an orange slice."
ChIJ6X_MG7EoQg0RrbHW-MYVflg,5,So delicious
ChIJ6X_MG7EoQg0RrbHW-MYVflg,5,Great beer with excellent tapas! Really recommend and it's not expensive.
ChIJF034ELEoQg0Rg5ctI24944Y,3,Cheap and nice staff but the terrace was not clean and the toilet was inhabited by a cockroach
ChIJF034ELEoQg0Rg5ctI24944Y,3,Very rude waiter working by himself looking to the floor and avoiding eye contact. Many beggars approaching the tables was a bit intimidating.
ChIJF034ELEoQg0Rg5ctI24944Y,5,"Super friendly staff, Beer was good"
ChIJF034ELEoQg0Rg5ctI24944Y,5,"Spectacular service and treatment. The food is delicious. Thanks for your service. A small suggestion: I love lemon beer, I hope your shop will have another type of lemon beer that will be more perfect.  (Just my personal opinion because it depends on each person's taste..)..."
ChIJF034ELEoQg0Rg5ctI24944Y,1,"I will never visit this place again.
Long waiting time for food. The tapas was on the level of cheaper fast food.
The lemonade offered by waiter was sweet and with an artificial flavor. I couldn‚Äôt even finish it.
Check the bill before you pay, be carefull with menu reccomendation coming from waiter (it can cost you a fortune).
I should check tripadvisor as well. Rating 2.5 tells everything. I cannot imagine who is rating this place positively."
ChIJqx7_abEoQg0RTK2_8sZNPLg,4,"I have ordered on Friday evening, a delivery took about 40 mins, on weekend it‚Äôs quite busy. A presentation could be better, I have got two whoppers and French fries. Everything was still hot, which is good. #Deliveryduringcovid"
ChIJqx7_abEoQg0RTK2_8sZNPLg,5,Sorry but I can't explain how the taste of coffee and Gofre ( Belgium waffle with chocolate ) was because the Combo was totally delicious and Iam highly satisfied. Nice snack with a dose of caffeine which can give you a nice power and feeling till the night come. ü•∞
ChIJqx7_abEoQg0RTK2_8sZNPLg,3,"Right in my tour around the fast food joints of Madrid, we've got this burger King, pretty much like any other.

It seems slightly understaffed, so the service isn't as fast as one would expect.

In any case it's location in a popular, well-known area of Madrid, in the proximity of several banks trade unions, public buildings, and the bull rink of Madrid, otherwise known as La Maestranza, no less, makes it very convenient, if you wish to enjoy a cheeseburger while being in the neighborhood."
ChIJqx7_abEoQg0RTK2_8sZNPLg,2,"Not one of their best burger kings, not very clean and unacceptably slow on preparing and serving the orders. Sorry guys, but 20 minutes waiting for a big king and a cheeseburger is way too much."
ChIJqx7_abEoQg0RTK2_8sZNPLg,2,Quite expensive for the fact that it‚Äôs an American fast food chain. Service was barf. The lady gave attitude when our food was ready but we didn‚Äôt hear her whisper our number. It‚Äôs classic Spanish customer service aka non existent. You‚Äôre better off going to The Good Burger (TGB) right next door. Better food and much more affordable. Don‚Äôt waste breath in this Burger King
ChIJS_zHErEoQg0RwZ9rkbEeORQ,5,Thanks a lot to Andres for his great service . The clams soup was truly delicious. Great value for money.
ChIJS_zHErEoQg0RwZ9rkbEeORQ,5,"Best place around, best staff and best food. I eat here every day and it doesn't disappoint. Not cheaper but better homemade food than everything around it."
ChIJS_zHErEoQg0RwZ9rkbEeORQ,3,"Menu del dia expensive on Saturdays at 20 euros for something not too special. Weekday menu reasonably priced! Have rated this better in the past but feel a bit cheated by the Saturday price. Also rang for 2 hours to make a reservation and no-one amswered the phone. Seriously guys, you really need to be a bit more professional!"
ChIJS_zHErEoQg0RwZ9rkbEeORQ,5,"I would like to recommen this best place of Madrid because of the ""tapas"" and the writers attention"
ChIJS_zHErEoQg0RwZ9rkbEeORQ,5,"I enjoyed my time here. With every round of drinks, they give you tapas or appetizers. A bit loud due to number of people but a good place to be with friends. Staff are very friendly and kind."
ChIJNYdQWLcoQg0RS2QafqrLADA,5,"the service outstanding - the food is the best thing I‚Äôve ever tried in Spain, and I‚Äôve been here 4-5 times! I recommend it."
ChIJNYdQWLcoQg0RS2QafqrLADA,3,"Food 4*  and initial impression of service was 1*. Upon our arrival male server turned his back and did not acknowledge us for a while. Until the manager came.
We were seated outside, which was a good point. Food was very good with Mexican notes. Over all good food and the great  need of staff training.
Merlooza dish was good."
ChIJNYdQWLcoQg0RS2QafqrLADA,5,"Good, wide and very recommendable place to have a drink or breakfast! Prices are great and affordable. Spanish omelette very tasteful..,üòã"
ChIJNYdQWLcoQg0RS2QafqrLADA,5,"We went the three of us for a wednesday dinner. We tried the tomato salad with anchovies, the croquettes and the boletus. All these starters were outstanding. Then we asked for the turbot and great experience after the waitress showed it up to us, cooked perfectly.  Afterwards a gin and tonic and back out by 23:00 due to the Covid restrictions. I will definitely come back. Well done!"
ChIJNYdQWLcoQg0RS2QafqrLADA,1,"I am Just finishing my dessert after 23min waiting for the waitress to visit my table. Yes!  He (Very slin spanish Guy) comes only when he remember us. Maybe because i AM black? I dont know...
Very Nice place but TERRIBLE SERVICE. And quite expencive as well.
I live Just around the corner, Was my first time here and Never again."
ChIJb8s_9LAoQg0RF-W-7RLm5uU,1,"This is the third year that we have brought a leg of ham (a company gift) so that they can cut it and give it to us in envelopes. And this year we asked our co-workers how many envelopes they were given in the butcher shops where they took it, because it turns out that they all answered between 30 and 35 envelopes and yet in this butcher shop they returned thirteen envelopes to us this year and about 15 in previous years. . Let everyone draw their own conclusion, but I won't go through there again."
ChIJb8s_9LAoQg0RF-W-7RLm5uU,5,"Incredible store with incredible service and super friendly staff, I recommend if you want an unforgettable service"
ChIJb8s_9LAoQg0RF-W-7RLm5uU,5,"Excellent site run by its owners, quality products and at a good price!"
ChIJb8s_9LAoQg0RF-W-7RLm5uU,5,"Sure hit. In the delicatessen they take great care that everything is fresh and they have a wide variety of products, including the best cheeses, hams or Iberian products. The butcher shop works a great genre, with all types of excellent cuts and meats. They undoubtedly offer quality, with many years of experience and a close and friendly treatment that rounds off each purchase."
ChIJb8s_9LAoQg0RF-W-7RLm5uU,5,"The products and service are spectacular. In both parts. Both meat and cold cuts and cheeses. It's worth trying. I recommend asking for special Argentine cuts, they get them a few days in advance. Very good!"
ChIJwbu1iLYoQg0R4_YFEvSXeEQ,3,
ChIJ__8Lg7AoQg0RkyBFTPKSgBQ,5,"During my trip to Madrid, I was recommended this Italian restaurant as one of the best in the city.

I had my Sunday lunch there, and I can definitely confirm the recommendation. The atmosphere is very cozy, and the owners, a husband and wife, were incredibly kind and welcoming. As an Italian, I can say that both the pizza and the quality of the ingredients used are excellent. I also tried the pasta, and it was just like in Italy!

I will definitely be back on my next trip to Madrid!"
ChIJ__8Lg7AoQg0RkyBFTPKSgBQ,5,"We had a great meal at Minelli 1960. For some reason, we needed a break from jamon and was looking for pasta near our airbnb. We had a great time from beginning to end. We ordered the pulpo and focaccia to start, loved it. Then had the lasagna, pasta amatriciana and ragu, all the dishes were excellent. The service was very friendly and we enjoyed the conversation with the owner. I have to be back to have their desserts, we were too full! Make a stop here while in Madrid!"
ChIJ__8Lg7AoQg0RkyBFTPKSgBQ,5,"We had an amazing dinner at Minelli 1960 yesterday, and it was an unforgettable experience! The food was absolutely incredible ‚Äì the pizza, pasta, and tiramisu were some of the best we‚Äôve ever had.

The waitstaff were outstanding, providing friendly and attentive service that made the evening even more special. We will definitely be coming back for more! Highly recommend this gem to anyone looking for authentic Italian flavors and a fantastic dining atmosphere. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
ChIJ__8Lg7AoQg0RkyBFTPKSgBQ,5,Comfortable food+Nice location. The restaurant is not very large but you it doesn't feel cramped.
ChIJ__8Lg7AoQg0RkyBFTPKSgBQ,5,The restaurant has its cozy vibe‚ú®& it is serving very delicious food
ChIJG4Czb7soQg0Re0dghROgXSI,5,The staff are very kind and the empanadas are great. My favorite was the ‚ÄúCebolla Carnelizada y Rucula‚Äù
ChIJG4Czb7soQg0Re0dghROgXSI,5,Lovely owners and staff.
ChIJG4Czb7soQg0Re0dghROgXSI,2,It was closed at 8 pm when google says open
ChIJG4Czb7soQg0Re0dghROgXSI,5,Pizzas are incredible.
ChIJG4Czb7soQg0Re0dghROgXSI,4,"It is a typical eatery, the staff's attention is good, the owner came over to ask how the food was. The quality of the food is good, although it is not the best mila I ate here in Madrid. Furthermore, the price is a little high if it is a weekend and you cannot take advantage of the menu. My recommendation is to go during the week and you can eat a delicious meal with the menu."
ChIJe1p5grEoQg0RC6s-msm03yw,5,Great bar with great service
ChIJe1p5grEoQg0RC6s-msm03yw,3,Normsl
ChIJe1p5grEoQg0RC6s-msm03yw,5,"Always at home, Jose and Jervi couldn't treat us and our friends better. Tapazas with each drink and very reasonable prices, if you are in the Manuel Becerra area you cannot miss it. The food on the menu is also of very good quality."
ChIJe1p5grEoQg0RC6s-msm03yw,5,"Without a doubt, a reference place in the neighborhood, for tapas or food. They have quality products, seasonal and well cooked.

Safe bet to taste Galician and Madrid."
ChIJe1p5grEoQg0RC6s-msm03yw,4,"Galician tavern with good service.
‚úÖ It has a fantastic terrace and the place is very original. It already makes you feel at ease.
‚úÖ the menu is extensive. Although all the dishes have that Galician touch which makes it special.
‚úÖ with the soda they give you a cover. I value it a lot
‚úÖ the plates are quite large
‚úÖthe quality is extraordinary
‚úÖ they serve relatively quickly
I will return"
ChIJ96rxuLEoQg0R7wKtVbkmwp4,5,"Good location and fast service. Great option for a quick stop.

For breakfast I had my favorite Spanish dish : the traditional Spanish omelette tapa. I think it had some onions and the egg was more liquid than curdled. It was very tasty, I truly recommend it."
ChIJ96rxuLEoQg0R7wKtVbkmwp4,5,"This place was amazing. They had a selection of Spanish food, that has been prepared second to none. Great atmosphere and service. We got confused because the plase looks a bit average from outside, but how wrong we were.. we were aiming for average lunch, and we had one of our best meals jn Madrid. Will definitely come back."
ChIJ96rxuLEoQg0R7wKtVbkmwp4,5,Good tortilla üëå The runny kind
ChIJ96rxuLEoQg0R7wKtVbkmwp4,5,"OK - I have no other experience of Salamanca cuisine, and almost equally limited on wider Spanish cooking. That said, I have eaten well in much of the rest of Europe and about the world, so can honestly give this place a total recommendation if delicious, unpretentious, 'home-made' cooking is what you fancy. We didn't even have a say in the menu - but 5 stars to the tortilla de patatas, croquettas de jam√≥n, chipirones con cebolla, alcachofas (en flor a la plancha) and what seemed to be a carbonnade Flamande with pomme frites. The red wine (a 2019  Ribera de Duero) was very classy. Worth going to Madrid for on it's own - so don't worry about the journey - it's a stroll north east of the big park."
ChIJ96rxuLEoQg0R7wKtVbkmwp4,5,"Great location. Amazing hospitality & service. Welcoming & friendly waitstaff & owner. Food, absolutely delicious. This is my neighborhood restaurant & I‚Äôm glad it is. It‚Äôs wonderful to know I have an establishment like this where I now my hunger will be completely satisfied & the environment is so welcoming. I will be back often."
ChIJ62-8s7MoQg0R-V-O0R7yk60,2,"We ordered  ternera con bambu y setas chinas but it came to us with no meat. We called them and they replaced it, and that's really good. But they also took back the food that has no meat. The delivery boy told us why it is already half, of course we have to it eat and expected that the meat is underneath. But, no no. No meat at all. They replaced it now with more meat and less vegetables. But their food is actually good. It has just a little mistake that could be fixed."
ChIJ62-8s7MoQg0R-V-O0R7yk60,5,Nice taste and good service
ChIJ62-8s7MoQg0R-V-O0R7yk60,4,Its god
ChIJ62-8s7MoQg0R-V-O0R7yk60,5,"I have only ordered food at home, but the friendliness of the restaurant owners when they brought my order home has been enough.  Regarding the most important thing, the food, it is delicious. I have tried several dishes of beef, chicken, shrimp, soup, rice, noodles... All exquisite.  It has become, without a doubt, my favorite Chinese restaurant.  I don't need to look any further. I absolutely recommend it."
ChIJ62-8s7MoQg0R-V-O0R7yk60,5,"The food was good! The beef with vegetables was delicious and the noodles were three delights, needless to say, everything was delicious! We have already been 3 times and we always leave happy with how friendly they are and full from the delicious food!"
ChIJBeYAk7EoQg0RWCzUmoYlPiY,4,"Same prices as in the city centre, the space is not really cozy, but the food was great."
ChIJBeYAk7EoQg0RWCzUmoYlPiY,5,Wonderful neighborhood place. The service is amazing. The owner treated our family like we were regulars.
ChIJBeYAk7EoQg0RWCzUmoYlPiY,5,Good Caribbean food. Very nice people in charge. Reasonable prices.
ChIJBeYAk7EoQg0RWCzUmoYlPiY,5,"A quiet place to eat, the service was impeccable. They welcomed us with a smile and said goodbye with the same. Without a doubt the potato omelet was a success, he asked us what the egg was and he got it right. To continue, the entrec√¥te with the garnish was another success. The hot grill so that we can cook the meat to our liking is wonderful.
Without a doubt quality price is wonderful. I will repeat."
ChIJBeYAk7EoQg0RWCzUmoYlPiY,5,"I didn't know him, I've gone for coffee and the customer service is wonderful. I'll go eat, the dishes they brought out while I was there looked very good."
ChIJcaIVj7QoQg0RrJ0SlgblgDY,5,"Very friendly, mindful and quick service and tasty sushi. I had avocado rolls and - wow- they were SO perfectly creamy and tasty. The makis and the edamame I had were also great. Good prices for very good food."
ChIJcaIVj7QoQg0RrJ0SlgblgDY,5,Very nice and fresh  food .the taste is so good .the staff here are so kind .worth to give a try. Will come back to try again.üëçüèªüëçüèª
ChIJcaIVj7QoQg0RrJ0SlgblgDY,5,My favorite sushi place in the zone. Never fails. Mi sitio de sushi preferido. Nunca fallan.
ChIJcaIVj7QoQg0RrJ0SlgblgDY,4,"Good food, nice people, clean place."
ChIJcaIVj7QoQg0RrJ0SlgblgDY,5,I have ordered a variety of sashimi at home. I have only added a few drops of soy. Absolutely delicious. I recommend it without a doubt.
ChIJ4c8phLooQg0R4qqtWrvU9kM,4,"We love coming back. The noodles are superb, however feel like Pad Thai could probably improve a bit more. Other than that we thoroughly enjoyed the Singapur Noodles, Singapur Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Chicken."
ChIJ4c8phLooQg0R4qqtWrvU9kM,5,"Once we ordered the food via Glovo, and after delicious surprise we decided that we need to go and eat in the restaurant. The atmosphere is very modern and in the same time the restaurant looks like like street food point in Asia. Pretty good slogan by the way! And the food - exceptional! Fresh ingredients of excellent quality give you true taste of Asia without a jet lag. The place where I will come back with pleasure!"
ChIJ4c8phLooQg0R4qqtWrvU9kM,4,"It was a bit noisy and the service was slow, but the food was good. We went on a ""two for one day"" and I'm sure it would probably be better any other day. üòä This place is not wheelchair friendly if you need to use the bathroom. Tip: the service inside seemed better than outside.  Update: they now have menu of the day for 12.95. It was really good and not as super busy as the other time. Lovely wait staff!"
ChIJ4c8phLooQg0R4qqtWrvU9kM,5,"Nice friendly staff, nice food.
Pad thai was good, Malay Laksa as well yesterday; just wish the mango sticky rice was actually sticky but they did advise about the difference.

Otherwise pretty good. Thanks to the team there tonight."
ChIJ4c8phLooQg0R4qqtWrvU9kM,1,Service was super slow. We went for a late lunch. The restaurant wasn‚Äôt even that busy. We got a table in a couple of minutes. The food took forever to arrive. And the Singapore noodles with tofu was drenched in oil. The tofu felt like it was just opened from a box and some few chunks were cut to put on the dish. Basically zero flavor tofu.  The Thai coconut milk soup was okay.
ChIJZ3SH1EsvQg0RSmcT9ApGPi0,5,"This place was the best I ate in madrid, I taste La maquina, vinitus and taberna maceira and none of them was eve closed to this place. The service provided by Maria, the Jamon serrano, the artichoke and rice with seafood was incredible and so tasty. Definitely a place to come if you visit Madrid. Approx 30-40 euros per person including 2 cups of wine."
ChIJZ3SH1EsvQg0RSmcT9ApGPi0,5,"Superb food, and super friendly staff. A really exceptionnal experience. Highly recommended."
ChIJZ3SH1EsvQg0RSmcT9ApGPi0,5,"Nice and tasty food, pleasant stuff, great location"
ChIJZ3SH1EsvQg0RSmcT9ApGPi0,5,"Food is absolutely great. Very generous portions! Can get pricy; expect 25 euros per head, but you will probably need no dinner..."
ChIJZ3SH1EsvQg0RSmcT9ApGPi0,5,Really good traditional restaurant that is mainly frequented by locals. The menu is slight more pricey but the food is excellent and the portions; good. I would recommend going there for lunch and getting the steak with potatoes.
ChIJJ0wtHkkvQg0R1GLxXLzbVa8,5,Excelent food! All the food we ordered was extremely delicious. The wine was also great! Highly recommend!
ChIJJ0wtHkkvQg0R1GLxXLzbVa8,5,"We ate here on a Sunday lunchtime, and at 2:30 the place was buzzing! Big family tables everywhere and a great atmosphere. We started with langostinos, delicious! Then on to the most amazing ham, perfect croquettes, just about holding together, and a beautiful salad of Tudela cogollos with anchovies. Then on to the main event. An amazing arroz con bogavante. Very messy, very tasty, and perfectly cooked with the perfect rice. The portion beat us, and the table was wrecked with deliciousness, but we were super happy.."
ChIJJ0wtHkkvQg0R1GLxXLzbVa8,1,"We stepped by to this place to have a quick dinner and unfortunately got extremely disappointed. The food was tasteless and we didn‚Äôt get a single smile from the staff. What a shame, especially that one day earlier we ate at Taverna el Vareo near Ventas, also Andalusian restaurant, where they showed us how wonderful Andalusian food can be. So we were looking forward to check El Montero de Cazorla. But we will not be back. Very disappointed üò¢"
ChIJJ0wtHkkvQg0R1GLxXLzbVa8,5,"First meal in Madrid and wow what a meal. The staff speak very little English but don't let that deter you. Steak, monkfish and fish paella were so good it was surreal. The fish paella was by the best with the dish being ordered for two 38 euros. So good words don't do it justice. The place is awesome and wines at great prices"
ChIJJ0wtHkkvQg0R1GLxXLzbVa8,5,We just had beers at the bar but the service was great. Good atmosphere.
ChIJ40MCBUgvQg0RLms5TONCg_M,5,Beautiful little restaurant. The owners were so nice and friendly. The food was outstanding. Highly recommended.
ChIJ40MCBUgvQg0RLms5TONCg_M,5,"Betelu is arguably one of the best restaurants in Madrid. Not for the decoration - it is understated and homely. One could walk past the place and not even notice. Nor for the location - it is a lower middle-class residential area, ten minutes' walk from the Ventas bullring, and out of the tourist spots. It is simply one of the best restaurants in Madrid for the food and service. Owned by a Navarrese family and named after their home town in Navarre, this restaurant serves home-cooked style honest dishes made with the very highest quality ingredients, hand picked by the father of the family who is now in his 80s and continues working, because this restaurant is his passion. Book in advance because the place is almost always full. I have been a customer at Betelu for over 20 years, and because it has never changed management, the quality has been consistently of the very highest standard. The only problem is that I'm the same age as the youngest members of the family,  so I can't look forward to eating here well into my retirement!"
ChIJ40MCBUgvQg0RLms5TONCg_M,5,Wow! Delicious and great service. Eat here!
ChIJ40MCBUgvQg0RLms5TONCg_M,5,Phenomenal.
ChIJ40MCBUgvQg0RLms5TONCg_M,5,Superb food and a proprietor that cares about it.
ChIJ8duTYUgvQg0RIat4aIONezM,3,"The food is fine, the store is small and the staffs there always have so low attention. There is no one at the counter and people keep calling desperately and left because no staffs answered.

I ordered half extravagante and half Hawaii but they gave me different one like the picture but as it‚Äôs cheap i didnt bother to make a fuss."
ChIJ8duTYUgvQg0RIat4aIONezM,5,"Amazing pizza!!! I tried pulled beef and chicken buffalo! Both were amazing. The staff is so nice! They had a mistake in my first visit so during my second visit a week later, they refused to charge me and I was happy guy with one free pizza üòãüòã
I love this place"
ChIJ8duTYUgvQg0RIat4aIONezM,3,"The location was great and surprisingly the pizza wasn‚Äôt too bad, maybe because our team were hungry. The service was great, we just needed more space but if you‚Äôre a small group it‚Äôll do a good enough job. Enjoy your slice of the day!"
ChIJ8duTYUgvQg0RIat4aIONezM,3,Very small place to dine it and tables are not clean
ChIJ8duTYUgvQg0RIat4aIONezM,3,"Very small, literally a four -table joint.  The pizza is kinda greasy and it all tastes the same. They do have an all - you can- eat offer for 6.50 e but they once took so long between service because of a problem with the oven they forgot to warn us about. Well, good for students"
ChIJ7a8upEsvQg0RD5UKCRppTjc,5,Very friendly people at the restaurant! Recommend if you need a quick tapas before the bullfight!
ChIJ7a8upEsvQg0RD5UKCRppTjc,5,The food here is just exeptional! Everything is fresh and delicious! Plus the service is so kind and profesional! Greetings for Mr Paul! Hope to be back here someday!
ChIJ7a8upEsvQg0RD5UKCRppTjc,3,Size matters and this place has a huuuuge ... terrasse and a bit away from the traffic. That's its main asset.  Waiters are very s...l...o......w. The food is Ok but a bit pricy for what it is. Food presentation is original but the quality is average.
ChIJ7a8upEsvQg0RD5UKCRppTjc,5,"Phenomenal experience.  We visited this restaurant right after an afternoon at the bullfight . Recommended by our concierge Guillermo at ourl Hotel Palacio Del Retiro.   We had the Rabo de Toro  ""bulls oxtail"" delicious! The  Chicharones ""torreznos de Avila"" .  We were attenda by Pablo , ask for him by name. Great experience,  across the street about 2 blocks from the palacio de toros"
ChIJ7a8upEsvQg0RD5UKCRppTjc,5,"The best experience and its a must visit when you are in Madrid.
Pablo the owner was so kind and we loved our music, which connected us...üéºüéºüéºüé∏"
ChIJge_NyEsvQg0R0f0WTCgO7XQ,4,Honestly everything was ok but nothing amazing.
ChIJge_NyEsvQg0R0f0WTCgO7XQ,5,The portions in this restaurant are quite large. We ordered a rack of ribs for two with a jacket potato. Very nice
ChIJge_NyEsvQg0R0f0WTCgO7XQ,5,Good and fast service but too much noise
ChIJge_NyEsvQg0R0f0WTCgO7XQ,5,Great food... awesome friendly staff.
ChIJge_NyEsvQg0R0f0WTCgO7XQ,3,"Again, a bad American food invitation restaurant"
ChIJl-ZmFUkvQg0RolssOSTcrF8,2,"It was the 2nd time there as we loved it the first time. (So there‚Äôs another review for the first visit) But this time was totally surprising - the two guys working there were just so rude, or not in the mood. ex: The food was dripping and dropping next to our faces as we were paying, we didn't even leave the table yet. > The service or how they run the restaurant is not steady. It probably depends on their mood, not sure.

1) The food was tasty and served fast. The drinks were correct and good, no weird stuff added.
2) AC was working well, quite pleasant to stay indoors.
3) Tableware was not clean and had food residue as serving.
4) It was Monday evening, not before 9 pm, which is acceptable for dinner here in Madrid- we were one of the last two tables not in rush hour. Respected them all the time and stayed not late.

We spoke Spanish and didn't expect have any higher standard for the service. But this has be mentioned‚Ä¶
So if you don't mind being treated bad (the first time the lady worked there was fantastic), as the food is authentic and the price is (not so cheap but) acceptable, go and try it!"
ChIJl-ZmFUkvQg0RolssOSTcrF8,5,"Amazing food - ordered potato cake with chicken and tuna, veal and cornmeal with pork - huge portions, quick service and lovely place. Cocktails were amazing as well. Manager didnt speak English but we made it work. Highly recommend and would come back again."
ChIJl-ZmFUkvQg0RolssOSTcrF8,5,Fantastic Peruvian restaurant. Very prize worthy. Fantastic food. Specially the fish. I had fish here for lunch and it was really good. First a wonderful fishsoup and then special fried fish. Wonderful. Prize is just right. Lunch menu is at 10‚Ç¨ They also have a grill menu for 10‚Ç¨ and that one is huge. Drink and desert are included.
ChIJl-ZmFUkvQg0RolssOSTcrF8,5,"Delicious food, very tipical. Really great sharing a Saturday after 10 p.m with Latin people."
ChIJl-ZmFUkvQg0RolssOSTcrF8,4,Food was tasty and not that pricey. The place is not that cozy but its worth it
ChIJiZEKfEkvQg0RJHMc4KXmj1M,1,Worst pizza I've ever had
ChIJiZEKfEkvQg0RJHMc4KXmj1M,5,"It was a wonderful experience.
The pizza was nice, large and soft and rhe place was clean and cool.
I will definitely be visiting again."
ChIJiZEKfEkvQg0RJHMc4KXmj1M,5,"Good quality pizza.. The employees are nice, too."
ChIJiZEKfEkvQg0RJHMc4KXmj1M,3,Normal
ChIJiZEKfEkvQg0RJHMc4KXmj1M,1,"We have ordered delivery through the website, and the pizza arrived completely upside down, with the ingredients scattered around the box and cold. After speaking with them, they sent us another pizza, which was practically inedible, with the dough that was falling apart. It will certainly be the last time we order here."
ChIJr_btk7QoQg0RrpvyBlaB3n8,5,"Decided to celebrate a birthday here, and what a great decision it was. Incredibly hospitable service,an inviting environment, and delicious food. Despite being stuffed we gladly indulged in dessert and some tea.

This establishment accommodated the 14 person party we had, and delivered a smooth service.

- Thank you for contributing to such a lovely memory"
ChIJr_btk7QoQg0RrpvyBlaB3n8,4,The food here is very! delicious and there's an incredible selection of starters and plates. There is a nice view of the Ventas bull ring from the street terrace but being on Alcal√° there is quite a bit of traffic though the noise was acceptable. Worth a visit for the authentic Lebanese fare.
ChIJr_btk7QoQg0RrpvyBlaB3n8,5,"The food and service were really good
Highly recommended"
ChIJr_btk7QoQg0RrpvyBlaB3n8,5,"This is the best Lebanese restaurant i have ever been toüòã the food was delicious with an incredible variety of starters and plates.
The service is really nice.
Worth a visit for the authentic Lebanese fare."
ChIJr_btk7QoQg0RrpvyBlaB3n8,5,"Coming to this restaurant before attending the Bullfight. Very understanding staff as we only have 30 mins before. He suggested to order shwarma for a quick bite.

The food were great.. nice ambience and nice staffs.

Definitely will come again to enjoy more üòÑ"
ChIJ3UCqekkvQg0R3hOI2knpun8,5,"I found this place because I was looking for a good chicken soup! They have a wide range of Ecuador food. We had the humita, chicken soup, Quaker drink, and encebollado - it was ALL DELICIOUS ! Good service, kid friendly, and amazing food. So happy to have found this restaurant!"
ChIJ3UCqekkvQg0R3hOI2knpun8,5,"A very cozy place, with a very helpful and friendly staff.

You can enjoy the real taste of the Ecuadorian food. You can share a dish; the size of their meals are enough for 2.

Highly recommended, we‚Äôll definitely come back!"
ChIJ3UCqekkvQg0R3hOI2knpun8,5,"Generous portions, tasty food, and friendly and attentive staff."
ChIJ3UCqekkvQg0R3hOI2knpun8,5,"If you like Ecuadorian food, or want value for your money, this is the place to go!  The portions are generous without sacrificing quality.  I liked it so much, I went there 3 times in two weeks and introduced the restaurant to my friends in Madrid.    A block away from El Carmen metro station."
ChIJ3UCqekkvQg0R3hOI2knpun8,5,"We stumbled upon this place randomly, but one of the servers (Alex) made sure to show us how good the Ecuadorian cuisine was and overall made our evening with his attetude and recommendations. We enjoyed the plantain appetizer called patacones best!!"
ChIJhY3znLQoQg0RCkmjBMaSaX4,2,"I was expecting a lot more from this place. Portion size was decent but this is not the taste and flavor you expect from a Mexican restaurant. The al Pastor pork was dry, the alambre didn't taste good. Only plate that was worth it were the Nachos. Not impressed so I won't return."
ChIJhY3znLQoQg0RCkmjBMaSaX4,1,"Chicken fajitas was basically boiled chicken and boiled red pepper, in a watery sauce.   Absolutely the worst Mexican dish I have ever had in my life.

The waitress absolutely miserable.

Will never go back there again."
ChIJhY3znLQoQg0RCkmjBMaSaX4,3,"Seems family-owned, small staff, slow service. Food was flavorful but not authentic Mexican. We had nachos which were well made and tasty. The huarache was made of carnitas on the sweet side."
ChIJhY3znLQoQg0RCkmjBMaSaX4,5,"What makes a good Mexican restaurant is a proper burrito, a nice ambient with Mexican decor, sombreros and a service full of heart.
In this sense this the best Mexican restaurant in Salamanca. And probably in Madrid."
ChIJhY3znLQoQg0RCkmjBMaSaX4,5,"Delicious food, excellent service. We ordered the menu for two people. When they saw that we have eaten all the tortillas and there was still some food in the saucepan, they gave us more tortillas to accompany what was left in the pot."
ChIJM5VC4k4vQg0Rv25jhnM_QTQ,5,"The Yegros children's dining team, led by Juan Pedro and Nacho, demonstrate exceptional commitment every day, paying attention to the quality and variety of meals at our school. But above all, it is like a big family that meets every day to care for and feed our students and teachers. With a smile and full dedication they make each meal more than just a meal. They are true heroes who nourish both the body and spirit of our school community!"
ChIJM5VC4k4vQg0Rv25jhnM_QTQ,5,"The Yegros children's dining rooms at the Casa de la Virgen School offer an exceptional experience, with a friendly and professional team that stands out daily. The food is delicious, varied and adapted to children, making every moment memorable for them."
ChIJM5VC4k4vQg0Rv25jhnM_QTQ,5,"I have a girl who is allergic to milk protein and I am delighted with them. They are super respectful and responsible with allergies, plus they eat great; She loves the food they make, she says it is delicious.
THANK YOU for everything...it is difficult to find good professionals."
ChIJM5VC4k4vQg0Rv25jhnM_QTQ,5,"I wouldn't change the peace of mind that comes from knowing that my daughter with celiac disease eats healthy, with quality, delicious foods. In addition to the time you save by not having to think about daily menus, and probably due to the rush in which we go, they are more basic. At school he eats everything. He tells me that the menu is super varied and always includes fruit or yogurt.
Very happy and, above all, calm."
ChIJM5VC4k4vQg0Rv25jhnM_QTQ,5,Eaters Yegros and their entire team of cooks have fed me throughout my childhood at school and the food was always good and varied. I am very glad that your work continues and thank you very much for all these years
ChIJjaMr-EkvQg0RuqtJcRAWTqk,1,"On December 18 at the Sales Market establishment, I make a reservation for a turkey to pick up on the 23rd, obviously for Christmas Eve dinner.
This late when I go to pick up the order, I find that the turkey has literally ""flew"" and does not appear anywhere, the solution offered by the employees is to take another one with a price infinitely higher than the one in charge! ‚Ç¨75! !!
This lack of seriousness and professionalism on the part of the company has caused me a significant setback when organizing an important family celebration.
I will not go through these establishments again, and I will take care of giving as much negative publicity to anyone who tells me anything about that company."
ChIJjaMr-EkvQg0RuqtJcRAWTqk,1,"FATAL!!
I bought a cake and when I got home the cream was melted, the cake was undone and the strawberries were on top without removing the green part.....very poorly packaged, with the price they charge, which is very expensive, at least they could put a box in conditions to carry it.
WORST IMPOSSIBLE"
ChIJjaMr-EkvQg0RuqtJcRAWTqk,1,"The other day they gave me a chicken that smelled, I won't go back to La polleria Sertina in this market, plus they always try to sell you the most expensive thing or what they are interested in and if you say no they make a bad face. I had a good opinion of this brand, but this particular store does not have the fresh stuff. I don't recommend it."
ChIJjaMr-EkvQg0RuqtJcRAWTqk,1,"Oh my goodness, they just charged me 1.25 for a frozen croissant that costs 0.30 cents at Mercadona and Aldi. The same delicious frozen food baked in the oven for a while. Too much price it seems to me. What was said in Aldi and Mercadona 0'30. Don't fall into my horror"
ChIJjaMr-EkvQg0RuqtJcRAWTqk,1,"Super bad attention. Very bad face and they treated us terribly. 0 recommended. I will not return again, they gave us bread that looked like a stone hard, while paying I asked to change it and the woman serving told us no because she had already given it to us."
ChIJw4uAi0gvQg0R0l0rdOpdfY0,5,One of the only places I've been able to find decent spicy food (chicken madras) in Madrid. Delicious.
ChIJw4uAi0gvQg0R0l0rdOpdfY0,5,"Very good place for halal food. The staff is very courteous.
Prepares all kind of Pakistani food on order"
ChIJw4uAi0gvQg0R0l0rdOpdfY0,5,"Glad we found this place had the nicest kebab, we really weren't expecting it as we seem to have eaten in cafe bars all holiday. Highly recommended. Chef does samosas, pakoras and curry. They even had a lot of vegetarian options. Pizza was fab too."
ChIJw4uAi0gvQg0R0l0rdOpdfY0,4,"Nice little neighbourhood place for Indian food takeaway.

Edit: I've ordered sth on Just Eat and they cancelled the order with no explanation. Called and the phone was off."
ChIJw4uAi0gvQg0R0l0rdOpdfY0,5,"Amazing restaurant close to w
Everywhere, very tasteful. My friend Luisillo ask a large amount of food very cheap, but Zu√±i didn't want gain weight so finally we ask nothing."
ChIJH3MqjkgvQg0RH3U7G_76Fvk,5,"It's a lovely place.
Lovely Staff, delicious chicken and above all, their sauces were good.
Will definitely be visiting again soon."
ChIJH3MqjkgvQg0RH3U7G_76Fvk,1,"Look, I always order here and I'm delighted but today I order by balloon and what is my surprise that the chicken arrives incomplete and I call the establishment and they don't take care of it. I think it's very bad customer service that they don't give me a solution very bad service no I ask you for more. I have ordered more than 10 chickens almost every week but I will stop ordering."
ChIJH3MqjkgvQg0RH3U7G_76Fvk,1,"About 4 months ago the chicken was very delicious and highly recommended.
Right now the chicken is terrible...dry, very dry...like those chickens that when you eat it and the skin is hard.
The truth is, what a change it has made.
Too bad for them because they have lost a client (at home there are 6 of us) I mean they lost 6 clients."
ChIJH3MqjkgvQg0RH3U7G_76Fvk,1,"The HORRIBLE DRY and BURNED chicken, INEDIBLE on top, we ended up in the emergency room because the sauces were in poor condition. I won't go to this place anymore. I prefer to go to Carrito Charr√∫a which is 1000 times better (it's next door on Alcal√° Street) look what happened to me for saving two euros. Now you will see how by a stroke of magic there are some good reviews, it is a LIE, they are the same employees and friends (this has been confirmed to me by a person who works there and who has also confirmed to me that there are chickens that they have to sell reheated)"
ChIJH3MqjkgvQg0RH3U7G_76Fvk,5,"One of the best chickens I've ever had. I recommend going first thing after opening because, as you can see in the photos, the lines are very long, but once they serve you it's very fast and they have everything ready so you just have to choose the menu, grab the bag and run.  Once you try the roast potatoes and the grilled chicken you remember that it was worth the long line.
I RECOMMEND 100%"
ChIJ4zFnB0ovQg0RTyNyDA4j6oU,5,"This delicatessen is the best!! They have a wide selection of cold cuts, Iberian ham, varied cheeses, etc. They also carry some wines, olives, pat√©s, etc. One of the things I think is the best, are their sandwiches, you choose what you want and the kind of bread and they will make it for you at a really good price! They will even add sliced tomato (if you buy it next door at the green grocer or bring it from home). We get sandwiches made there when we are going on a hike. This place is a gem and the employees are so nice and pleasant. My dog used to stop at their door because of the good smells coming out of the store! It's always packed!"
ChIJ4zFnB0ovQg0RTyNyDA4j6oU,5,"High quality products from various Spanish regions (jam√≥n de bellota, torta del Casar, sardinas ahumadas), good international cheese variety and a good selection of Spanish wines."
ChIJ4zFnB0ovQg0RTyNyDA4j6oU,5,"The salami sandwich is exquisite! The quality is really very good, I highly recommend them."
ChIJ4zFnB0ovQg0RTyNyDA4j6oU,5,"They have very good quality hams, they give you the option of starting it and they remove a part of the bone to cut it better. They are very friendly and have very good sausage products. They accept paper restaurant checks, in case you have them, it is a good option to spend them. Very friendly and attentive. I will definitely return."
ChIJ4zFnB0ovQg0RTyNyDA4j6oU,5,"It's a pleasure to shop here. The quality is 10 and the prices are very good
The employees are very friendly.
They make a sandwich + drink pack for less than 3 euros and it is delicious.
There's a reason there are always people buying snacks no matter what time you go."
ChIJuYCNjjUvQg0R0f511Gzlugw,4,"Very good breakfast options, including the traditional pan con tomate, but also good  croissants (french style - butter, no sugar;)"
ChIJuYCNjjUvQg0R0f511Gzlugw,3,Your typical bar de barrio.
ChIJuYCNjjUvQg0R0f511Gzlugw,5,"We reserved a table to eat there with the film crew, the guy had the table ready with everything served freshly as we arrived, everything perfect, with every detail, and at a very good price! In addition, he invoiced us without any problem, thank you very much!!!!"
ChIJuYCNjjUvQg0R0f511Gzlugw,5,This place is very cool!! Bar with several options at the best price and the owner is very kind and friendly!!
ChIJuYCNjjUvQg0R0f511Gzlugw,5,"What stands out most about this place is its service. Kindness, speed and good prices. A pleasure every time we go."
ChIJ-ftJpUEvQg0Rkv8o1vsCgQU,5,"Everything delicious, very good service"
ChIJ-ftJpUEvQg0Rkv8o1vsCgQU,3,"Well, what can I say, I have been several times, the first time I was delighted, the other times it has gradually fallen into decline, they are very slow, the food was delicious the first time, the second and third time it left a lot to be desired, they put me a spicy cup (very delicious by the way) but once we finished eating we saw how they took the cup from us and put it on another table, how disgusting. We had put spoons in it, we didn't manage to put it in our mouths, but I started the worse since it seemed like a lack of hygiene to me."
ChIJ-ftJpUEvQg0Rkv8o1vsCgQU,4,"The menu is very good and well priced, the onion is very delicious. The only downside was that when the girl was left alone and I asked her for a coffee, she didn't know how to make it."
ChIJ-ftJpUEvQg0Rkv8o1vsCgQU,1,"Amador Valdez Street, 6 I don't know if it's the only establishment they have, but this one is INCREDIBLE They don't have card payment options!!!! The manager works alone and is very rude!!! I was not able to try their food because I had no payment options and after the attention provided by the manager much less!!! I give it one star because I can't give it less!!"
ChIJ-ftJpUEvQg0Rkv8o1vsCgQU,5,"The owner's attention is unbeatable, the restaurant is very cozy and the food is delicious, my family and I would love to return to Madrid just to eat there again üòÅ."
ChIJgy0_f0gvQg0RSiv-gmwW9wE,5,"Been there 3 times during our stay! Great service, superb food, not expensive. Watch out: meals are big! As well, it seems not one if from Uruguay apart other parillero üòÅ"
ChIJgy0_f0gvQg0RSiv-gmwW9wE,5,Great food and huge portions for fair prices. Cozy and nice service. Also reservation would be recommended.
ChIJgy0_f0gvQg0RSiv-gmwW9wE,5,Perfect place for meat lover !!! The taste of food is amazing
ChIJgy0_f0gvQg0RSiv-gmwW9wE,5,"The food and price are great! I love the meat and chicken at this place. The prices are fab!!

Must say the wait times for take-away is long during the weekends! However, it's well worth the wait."
ChIJgy0_f0gvQg0RSiv-gmwW9wE,5,"Excellent food, quick service and wildly popular. They have daily menu, a la carte and take away food. Roasted chicken is superb and roasted meats are also superb. Very recommendable!"
ChIJ9fSKh7UoQg0RJyHjLZUoMvU,5,"Top traditional food! Meat Cachopo was extraordinary! If you are a meat lover and not afraid to taste something new, then this is the secret local place 2B. Do not expect any fancy things, it is very simple cheap setup, but the food is amazing. Whatch out, almost all food contains cheese which was delicious for us but someone might not like it."
ChIJ9fSKh7UoQg0RJyHjLZUoMvU,5,"Cachopo speciality restaurant. Classic spanish recipes as well. Tasty and reasonable pricing. Do not bring your best clothes, it will get covered i  the kitchen smoke."

ChIJVQp5eEgvQg0RcdWbXN-uIT8,5,We all loved the delicious chicken.
ChIJVQp5eEgvQg0RcdWbXN-uIT8,5,yessss
ChIJVQp5eEgvQg0RcdWbXN-uIT8,4,"I've been ordering there for years.
The truth is that I always repeat it because of the excellent quality of what they sell. The best chicken you can ever taste and everything else is very good too.
As for the place, it is quite rustic, nothing very elaborate, yes, only cash and there is almost always a line to order, that's how good it is that they are demanding in what they sell and how they sell it."
ChIJVQp5eEgvQg0RcdWbXN-uIT8,1,"Horrible, the worst chicken I ever ate, I don't recommend it. I ordered a complete chicken, the chicken arrived but parboiled as for soup, the potatoes arrived ugly and so little quantity, look for another place, this is the worst place, it's not a skirt, it's a total scam! I couldn't be clearer."
ChIJVQp5eEgvQg0RcdWbXN-uIT8,3,"Good and abundant food, chicken with a charcoal flavor, although with several buts. The chicken was cooked but it lacked time to dissolve (a little tough) and the price was somewhat expensive. The sauces accompanying the potatoes were very very good."
ChIJO21Fd0gvQg0R3xpaRyIWC-Q,4,"Another of the bars and restaurants that we find is the REAL ASIATIC BAR RESTAURANT, on CALLE FLORENCIO LLORENTE, 3. 28027 MADRID.

We tried the SPRING ROLL with a compacted version and little filling, which, however, managed to captivate us with its flavor and crunchy consistency.

Next, we were served the HOUSE RICE, a generous offering with BEEF, CHICKEN, PRAWNS, ONION, PEPPER, CARROT AND EGG. The rice was well seasoned with your typical GLUTAMATE, SALT AND THICK SOY SAUCE. The level of the cook is that of a restaurant rather than a bar. In fact, a good part of the orders are delivered, which means that the level of the chef is within the good average standard!

Finally, we tried the PRAWN CAN-BAO, a spicy dish with ONION AND GREEN PEPPER, OYSTER SAUCE. The recipe was well done. Just mention that the prawns had unpeeled tails, which disconnected us from the tasting process of the whole. Anyway, the entire menu allowed us to enjoy this visit to the restaurant.

The customer service has been very correct. Short times and attention at all times without wavering. Grateful to the spouses MARIA AND JOS√â for their kind attention. We will return."
ChIJO21Fd0gvQg0R3xpaRyIWC-Q,5,"We ate the menu of the day and it was very delicious. We tried the chicken soup, the sweet and sour pork and the stir-fried chicken tenderloin. All very good üëèüèº"
ChIJO21Fd0gvQg0R3xpaRyIWC-Q,5,I went for lunch at noon and for 10 euros each we ate an impressive menu of the day. I recommend
ChIJO21Fd0gvQg0R3xpaRyIWC-Q,1,Very bad attention from the bar waiter. You have to be more empathetic. Long live Spain
ChIJO21Fd0gvQg0R3xpaRyIWC-Q,1,"I was disappointed, I expected to eat delicious food, since there is Chinese and Peruvian food
We ordered roast chicken, it had no flavor
The chaufa rice had a lot of onion, the uncooked rice, the only good thing I ate was the salad with a very good sauce
I have been to places that honor the gastronomy of their respective countries."
ChIJK3bgecooQg0RjUUMbDnq9IQ,5,"I loved it. Good service, cozy place, a varied and quality menu. I recommend the Yema (similar to broken eggs), exquisite.
The tripe, very well done.
Good discovery."
ChIJK3bgecooQg0RjUUMbDnq9IQ,5,"A must visit in Madrid near Las Ventas. I think it is the best place to try oxtail, tripe and, without a doubt, oxtail croquettes! Spectacular!"
ChIJK3bgecooQg0RjUUMbDnq9IQ,5,"Neighborhood bar, cozy, great people in charge, traditional food.
Good treatment and attention from the Bardera family.

It's bullfighting. Well, so what? I do not enjoy watching said activity.
But Bullfighting and gastronomy are not linked as far as I know. They are traditions and must be respected.

100% recommended!
Come try it."
ChIJK3bgecooQg0RjUUMbDnq9IQ,5,"Top products. First class oxtail. Good atmosphere, it's clear that I'll be back. Traditional bullfighting bar"
ChIJK3bgecooQg0RjUUMbDnq9IQ,5,"Typical tavern with a bullfighting atmosphere, near the bullring, where the specialty is oxtail, very good, we accompany it as a starter with the Yema, a portion of scrambled eggs with potatoes, and on top with good ham.
Highly recommended."
ChIJIVRLIUgvQg0RitSYfC3lK1M,5,"Friendly staff and nice ""tapas""."
ChIJIVRLIUgvQg0RitSYfC3lK1M,5,Ok
ChIJIVRLIUgvQg0RitSYfC3lK1M,5,"Very good. The potato omelette is spectacular. The menu is ‚Ç¨14 but it has first, second, dessert and coffee. Very good and abundant food."
ChIJIVRLIUgvQg0RitSYfC3lK1M,5,"Jose and his brother are great. The potato omelette is delicious, the shrimp salpic√≥n too, and the rest of the menu too. Special mention to their salad, spectacular. We were in Madrid for 3 days and the 3 of us came here for lunch, dinner or breakfast."
ChIJIVRLIUgvQg0RitSYfC3lK1M,3,"We went for the torreznos but they didn't convince me. They were cold, hard and unappetizing (it seems they were the ones they put as tapas with beers). Regular attention. Typical neighborhood bar without major aspirations."
ChIJ4cavRUYvQg0Rv7gM-RbG9H4,5,"A typical local pub, with tasty tapas and very friendly atmosphere. Loved it!"
ChIJ4cavRUYvQg0Rv7gM-RbG9H4,5,"Incredible food, fast service, very friendly/happy staff. We had patatas bravas and pulpo a l√† gallega. Both were delicious, so good!!! Great vibe, pumping tapas bar."
ChIJ4cavRUYvQg0Rv7gM-RbG9H4,5,"Fantastic local Tapas bar, staff are outstanding and super helpful if you don‚Äôt speak Spanish and the kai ,Tapas and atmosphere is awesome a must visit if your in the area."
ChIJ4cavRUYvQg0Rv7gM-RbG9H4,5,"Visited this place 3 times in a week. Friendly staff, huge portions and affordable prices. Staff even gave us free food which is always good (: definitely would recommend this place to everyone!"
ChIJ4cavRUYvQg0Rv7gM-RbG9H4,1,"Beer and ginebra is ok, but tapas not. And they served the worst tortilla from the batch. 1 üåü wohoo!"
ChIJHXj4ukkvQg0RxVpFo6f_BHg,5,"Nice-family style restaurant with homemade food. When you enter, there are 3 tables and the bar, The main dining area and bathrooms are downstairs. The family is from Orense, Galicia and are very friendly. The waitresses are very busy and oftentimes forget to bring you things, like oil and vinegar, etc. The price for the ""menu of the day"" is 10.20 euros. You can't beat it. This isn't a fancy place but it is good and has been serving the neighborhood for 40 years. You can tell by how many regulars they have, that people are happy with them! Not wheelchair accessible. I'd say that's the only negative."
ChIJHXj4ukkvQg0RxVpFo6f_BHg,5,"Good barrio atmosphere, pulpo & huevos rotos con jam√≥n.. one of the best ive had here. Usual suspects all bomb. Nice free tapa with dobles.

Would come back in the area. Great quality vs. price ratio. Place is full of locals for a reason"
ChIJHXj4ukkvQg0RxVpFo6f_BHg,5,Great little place! Food was delicious and walking distance from our hotel.
ChIJHXj4ukkvQg0RxVpFo6f_BHg,1,"The food wasn‚Äôt as good as reviews describe. It‚Äôs fairly terrible‚Äîlamb was burnt and the fries were greasy and sadly soft.

I ordered lamp combo (which is 10 euro), a small snack (3 euro) and a cola. They charged me 19.6 euro in total. Either the cola is super expensive or they ripped me off.

Be careful."
ChIJHXj4ukkvQg0RxVpFo6f_BHg,5,"The food was delicious and clearly homemade.  The waiter was extremely friendly and personable. I don't live near this restaurant,  but I will make an effort to return."
ChIJU9tK90YvQg0Rc4l-a6bBtpQ,5,Everything very good. Great price and the staff is amazing. Will return. Thank you!
ChIJU9tK90YvQg0Rc4l-a6bBtpQ,5,"We met Jose a few weeks ago and it feels like we are at home in his bar. The generosity of the owner is limitless, his heart is very kind. He is very patient with us, teaching us Spanish; In my opinion here is the best service in the neighbourhood of Chamberi. Gracias Jose. De las cobardas ;)"

ChIJgw6kdEkvQg0R3LLT82o9i00,2,"Although I am not paid by Google to leave reviews, I will do it.
First time we ordered it, it was great. One of the best pizzas we've ever tried.
Next two times - abssolutely awful - either late, tasteless or burnt.
Never again."
ChIJgw6kdEkvQg0R3LLT82o9i00,5,Good gluten free pizza and friendly service
ChIJgw6kdEkvQg0R3LLT82o9i00,1,Just awfull
ChIJgw6kdEkvQg0R3LLT82o9i00,4,"Nice place, nice Pizza"
ChIJgw6kdEkvQg0R3LLT82o9i00,4,Regular.
ChIJw4VBHEgvQg0RNAuq28gb3nQ,5,"Incredible! Impeccable service, very attentive!  The food is incredible, I recommend trying the ""gulas"" dish"
ChIJw4VBHEgvQg0RNAuq28gb3nQ,5,"I bought a Chinese menu to take away and everything was very delicious! I loved the chicken with chillies. In addition, the service is very friendly and they give you a good tapa with the beer. Very well priced. Recommended!"
ChIJw4VBHEgvQg0RNAuq28gb3nQ,5,"It has a very good menu at a very good price, I tried stew soup and beef with onion. Both the Chinese and Spanish versions are very good.
To highlight the treatment of the owner and the waitress."
ChIJw4VBHEgvQg0RNAuq28gb3nQ,4,Typical Chinese food. It was very delicious although I ordered chicken and they gave me beef.
ChIJw4VBHEgvQg0RNAuq28gb3nQ,5,"My favorite place to eat Chinese food, it also has an extensive bar with good liquor, as well as wine and delicious coffee, the service is excellent from the waitresses, they also have a tacabo machine, I recommend it üëçüòâ"
ChIJ7dKRYrMoQg0RpaVNcx4Khgc,3,Paella was okay. But the starters were way better than that. Nice to see all the pictures of the bullfights. Not suitable for vegetarians/vegans. The waitress was very kind!
ChIJ7dKRYrMoQg0RpaVNcx4Khgc,5,"Reasonably priced, great food, great service and hospitality from Cora."
ChIJ7dKRYrMoQg0RpaVNcx4Khgc,4,Enjoyed the oxtail and sangria. The ham and cheese plate was okay. I would eat there again.
ChIJ7dKRYrMoQg0RpaVNcx4Khgc,5,"Well, I would like to thank the owner of the restaurant for his great interest in Spanish culture, decoration and furniture in the restaurant, which suggests a great history. The food was very tasty and the order was very good, the family was very happy with the day we spent in the restaurant.
Mojitoüíô"
ChIJ7dKRYrMoQg0RpaVNcx4Khgc,4,"The bull meat has a really strong taste and it is totally different from any bull meat that you have ever eaten because it the meat from the bull that fights in the corida de toros.
The meat from the tail is quite soft and tasty. It is worth eating although it is a little bit expensive for me. You should try it because the bull meat is very difficult to cook in home."
ChIJ5xTPw7MoQg0RDJUGywDY438,5,"This establishment is quite small so reservations are recommended on weekends and at bullfights.
The wooden furniture makes the atmosphere very cosy.
The waiters always seem to be in high spirits and they are really kind to the customers.
It  has an incredible wide variety of beers,  accompanied by the best tapas in Madrid.
The toilets are extremely clean.
Surely we'll be back!"
ChIJ5xTPw7MoQg0RDJUGywDY438,5,"Many places in Madrid say they specialise in beer but very few do. The beer selection seems endless, good thing the bartender guide you through it. As if it weren't enough, the food is ""home-made"" and delicious. Would give it 6 stars of I could."
ChIJ5xTPw7MoQg0RDJUGywDY438,5,"A very small, but cozy family-ran business. The service was great and the staff was very welcoming and up for conversation! I visited this place with my parents and all three of us were incredibly happy with everything! I was more than happy to find a place in Madrid that‚Äôs matching my name and serving my favorite beer on draft. I feel right at home at this place and I will definitely come back here in the future!"
ChIJ5xTPw7MoQg0RDJUGywDY438,5,Wonderful brewery and restaurant in the Salamanca area in Madrid. Food is delicious and the beer selection is amazing. The bartender was really helpful and knowledgeable about each of the drinks that they have. Would recommend!
ChIJ5xTPw7MoQg0RDJUGywDY438,2,"A great selection of beers. The bad news: the barman on duty at the time had apparently never pulled a pint of beer in his life. The first one took a good ten minutes to arrive because he didn't angle the glass and kept getting a glassful of foam. Then the next one was heading the same way before he said that the beer in question was finished. An alternative beer was ordered. He seemed to be having trouble with that one too, apparently because he'd just started the barrel. That particular beer never materialised, mysteriously. However, the half pint from beer two was offered, perhaps as a gift to compensate for the delay and confusion? To avoid wasting it? No. It turned up in the bill at the end, as ""33cl"". Now, in Spain, a ""pint"" tends to be interpreted as half a litre, conveniently. I very much doubt that it's because they're applying the US measure and being generous. However, for the purposes of a badly-pulled half pint apparently being given away, a pint had now become 66cl, which is considerably more than the UK pint. When this was pointed out, the barman acknowledged the disparity, but appeared to think that the more generous measure was a favour to the customer.
Suffice to say, I didn't leave a tip."
ChIJO7vnFTYvQg0RDJD8EEr7x6g,3,"It looks dirty but I was surprised and the food was quite good. We ate outside on the pavement, on a sunny autumn afternoon and it felt great... except for the fish bones one the floor... they may think about sweeping the floor before service.
Service was a bit slow. I would go back for the food and the sun but they should definitely focus on cleaning and speeding-up the service."
ChIJO7vnFTYvQg0RDJD8EEr7x6g,3,"Good Halal restaurant, with a variety of oriental food options.
The staff is very friendly.

I recommend, and i repeat."
ChIJO7vnFTYvQg0RDJD8EEr7x6g,4,"Tucked away in the corner from the rest of the restaurants in the area, this restaurant offers a unique atmosphere, great food and wonderful service. Get ready to pay cash though as cards are very rarely accepted. Will definitely be going back."
ChIJO7vnFTYvQg0RDJD8EEr7x6g,5,"Excellent food, great service and very good prices. Cozy and has outdoor tables. Have been coming here for years ü•∞"
ChIJO7vnFTYvQg0RDJD8EEr7x6g,5,One of the best halal foods in madrid with an amazing terrace setting ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChIJv9RWE0QvQg0R6mBH974i4nI,5,"As a Romanian I approve this restaurant. The food looks and tastes authentic. Beside food, the ambience made me feel just like home and the staff hospitality. Clean and tidy, the place looked organized. The prices are fair for the quality and amount of food you'll receive.
If you want to try Romanian food I would recommend this place. I will surely revisit it.
Saru'mana pentru masa!"
ChIJv9RWE0QvQg0R6mBH974i4nI,5,If you want to taste the best Romanian dishes‚Ä¶then this is the place. A perfect experience. Definitely will return here. Congratulations guys !
ChIJv9RWE0QvQg0R6mBH974i4nI,5,"The restaurant was one of my best experience in Madrid. The taste was original from Romania, no doubt, it brought a lot of memories from the days I was student in Bucharest. The girls, the cook were incomparable. Thank you for the memories. Pupici and Sarut mainile

They even gave us extra. Money well spent. We would definately come back if we had chances."
ChIJv9RWE0QvQg0R6mBH974i4nI,5,"Papana»ôi ‚ù§Ô∏è Very tasty, prepare to wait a bit probably because they make them on the spot. Wished they had sour cherry jam, but we loved them either ways. They have Romanian soups, sarmale, and grilled platters. Very good prices."
ChIJv9RWE0QvQg0R6mBH974i4nI,5,Best food in Madrid!We are tourist for 2 days and the best food we find here.Fresh food and frendly staff.
ChIJG4n0rEsvQg0RUqVZJR3x-Iw,5,"Great food for an amazing price. The rollos de primavera are HUGE and very good. We ordered one each to start, but could have split one. I have been here 3 times and never been disappointed. I will be back many more times."
ChIJG4n0rEsvQg0RUqVZJR3x-Iw,5,"Excellent relationship quantity, quality and price. Very generous portions and tasty food."
ChIJG4n0rEsvQg0RUqVZJR3x-Iw,2,"Do not recommend this place.
Service was quick. But servers are very strange, they just stand around and stare at you. At least one person is going around emptying your table every time you finish an item - no privacy. Food is below average. Lemon chicken is all sweet - just one slice of lemon, barely any salt and no other flavor, just sweet. Everything else was quite bland. Having tasted different types of asian cuisine, I had high expectations. Other people posted nice pictures (and the food does look good). It's a Chinese restaurant - I was expecting the fried rice to be good at least. That was also disappointing. There are far better options for Asian food in Madrid."
ChIJG4n0rEsvQg0RUqVZJR3x-Iw,4,"Good prices, good sizes, but service can be better."
ChIJG4n0rEsvQg0RUqVZJR3x-Iw,5,"Hands down the best Chinese restaurant here. Huge menu selection, including Japanese as well. There are several combination dishes called ""boxes"" at a great price or menu of the day as well. The spicy shrimp and almond crusted chicken are fab. We've been going for over 15 years and have never been disappointed. The owner and the staff are friendly and efficient! I highly recommend!"
ChIJ6-lh3m-HQQ0RM0hZRGPJwQo,3,This restaurant is a little dated although it is nice. Average quality food for the price they ask for. First I ordered rice and it was cold and a bit stale. For the second I ordered entrec√¥te and it was very hard. The best thing about the food was the beer.
ChIJ6-lh3m-HQQ0RM0hZRGPJwQo,1,"Fatal attention
We booked for an event and they didn't notify us until we were all there, that to enter the venue, all guests had to pay ‚Ç¨26 per head‚Ä¶. Incredible
These things are notified when you make the reservation, if you want you can go ahead with the reservation or not, but you must notify
And on top of that, they are the ones who are offended.
They don't even deserve 1 star"
ChIJ6-lh3m-HQQ0RM0hZRGPJwQo,1,"Much to my regret, I have had to eat at this place several times for work and it is simply regrettable that they charge you 18.40 euros for a daily menu in which the food is from a jar/can

It is normal that there are always no people, to make matters worse the service is quite poor

If you order another muffin of Mercadona bread heated in a toaster, they charge you 1 eu more

IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS SITE, SPEND YOUR MONEY ON ANOTHER SITE"
ChIJ6-lh3m-HQQ0RM0hZRGPJwQo,4,We ate a very good stew. 87The price of the ticket is deducted from the invoice for any non-subscriber.
ChIJ6-lh3m-HQQ0RM0hZRGPJwQo,5,"This wonderful establishment has a very unique characteristic, so I can assure you that time will make it a unique place, due to its excellent service, cleanliness and organization.
It should be noted that just a few days after its opening, it has captured the attention of customers who come to visit this establishment, which has a pleasant climate for those who come there, its sports areas are very pleasant and well-known for the enjoyment of Campo tennis lovers, it has a fairly spacious Sauna, and a charming facility on the second floor of it, with a spectacular view..
Regarding the food preparation service, the work staff, and its management, have carried out a magnificent project, which will leave many positive things for the enjoyment of its clients. I extend my congratulations to this wonderful group, successes and good vibes."
ChIJEQ6g5DOHQQ0ROy8Y2bYsljc,3,"If you want to have lunch or dinner with splendid views of Madrid and surrounded by nature, this restaurant is a good option. Perhaps the most difficult thing is getting there. After several turns we concluded that the best thing is to go to the French Bridge, and take that entrance that is near the bridge heading west. It is best to ask the staff at the country club's entrance checkpoint where the restaurant, also known as ‚ÄúTerraza del Social‚Äù, is located. Discreet menu with some original dishes. Fantastic and fast service."
ChIJEQ6g5DOHQQ0ROy8Y2bYsljc,4,"Good atmosphere, attention to detail."
ChIJEQ6g5DOHQQ0ROy8Y2bYsljc,4,"Restaurant run by Luke, a Korean student of Adri√° and Mugaritz. During the week there is a tasting menu, and a simple menu on the weekends.
The use of long pants is mandatory for gentlemen.
Privileged views of Madrid."
ChIJEQ6g5DOHQQ0ROy8Y2bYsljc,4,"Restaurant inside the country club. It has a varied food, and for ordering simple things it is quite good."
ChIJEQ6g5DOHQQ0ROy8Y2bYsljc,5,"The menu of the day is magnificent, it is worth coming whenever you are in the country club both for the product and the service of the waiters."
ChIJad62ezkoQg0RAmJpJKPZV7A,3,"Rather pricey, had the feeling that most products were pre processed and not handmade"
ChIJad62ezkoQg0RAmJpJKPZV7A,5,Really  enjoyed  this museum. If you like  clothing  and the evolution  of  fashion  you'll  enjoy this.  The  hat exhibition was  impressive. Some of the  pieces  are stunning. I especially  enjoyed  the  Balenciaga  section. Relaxed  and  peaceful. There  seems to  be  a little  shop  and  restaurant  both of  which  were  closed. Some  interactive  and child  friendly  installations  also. Worth  a visit  on a rainy  afteenoon.
ChIJad62ezkoQg0RAmJpJKPZV7A,4,"Great food but service needs to turn it up a notch. We had reserved for 8 at 2PM but when we arrived the table was not ready and the maitre was not very pleasant, telling us not to sit down until they had set it up.  We were extremely tired and had one person who really needed to sit. Service was really lacking at all levels. Will repeat to see if it was a one time thing and because the menu was very good, creative and at an excellent price."
ChIJad62ezkoQg0RAmJpJKPZV7A,4,Quite an enjoyable museum. Most information is in English and Spanish and easy to follow. It's interesting to see the progression of fashion throughout the ages and its relationship with social norms.
ChIJad62ezkoQg0RAmJpJKPZV7A,1,"I had the worst experience in this Resturant. I invited my Profesors in this place BUT the serves was below expectations. And when I complained to the manager they did not cooperate at all and make me embarrassed with my guests!!!
It's not a place for events !!!

Tuve la peor experiencia en este restaurante. Invit√© mis profesores en este lugar pero los sirve estaba fatal . E incluso cuando me quej√© al manager del Resturant's  no ha repuestado bien  !!! No es un logo que trata los estrangeros bien!!!!"
ChIJrS84HJ8pQg0RW8fDC2x4RLA,3,"Today when paying for coffee, to my surprise the new price was ‚Ç¨1.87 and I asked him and he told me that it had gone up üò≥ I think these prices are exorbitant in a hospital, it should be regulated since there are patients admitted for months and pay daily for meals and drinks is a big expense.
The staff is unfriendly and slow, causing long queues. I can understand that they want to provide good care and peace of mind, but normally those of us who use this service do so because we have a family member hospitalized or because we are working and the time we have is limited.
Thank you"
ChIJrS84HJ8pQg0RW8fDC2x4RLA,2,"I simply asked if they had anything to eat gluten-free, and they had several alternatives so we ordered a mixed sandwich...acceptable without further ado, the staff was friendly, I really didn't expect anything and it was 8:30 in the morning rush hour."
ChIJrS84HJ8pQg0RW8fDC2x4RLA,1,Terrible customer treatment. There is only one person serving so much demand. Slowness for what you are looking for; Eat something quickly since you are inside a hospital.
ChIJrS84HJ8pQg0RW8fDC2x4RLA,1,"Oh my god!!! For a hospital cafeteria, they take time, without gloves, humor...among them while there is a line, they take a long time. I am a regular at Rodilla on other sites, I don't understand this
."
ChIJrS84HJ8pQg0RW8fDC2x4RLA,3,"Small implant of this brand with its typical offer. Alternative to eat something besides the hospital cafeteria with which it shares a location. The downside is that there is usually a long queue and the service is a bit slow, so at certain times getting a coffee can take a while."
ChIJNQEOLFspQg0RTOWrs4oOzxQ,1,"I come to this place a lot because it catches me on my way for a coffee. Today, having time, I stopped to have a snack. According to the menu, the snack coffee + pastries or tomato toast is ‚Ç¨2.60. As you can see in the photo, it does not specify what type of pastry, the girl tells you that it has to be one of the ones she has displayed on the counter. When it comes time to charge me, he charges me ‚Ç¨3.30 because he says that only croissants come in, not the pastries he has on display. I tell her no, she doesn't put it on and the girl doesn't care, it is what it is.
They are not even ways to treat people and on top of that, charging me ‚Ç¨0.60 more just because they feel like it.
After this, I am not going to return to this site because I find this treatment and this way of scamming people incredible."
ChIJNQEOLFspQg0RTOWrs4oOzxQ,5,"Without words, a perfect place and with very affordable prices, the calamari was delicious and the beef, I won't even tell you about it.... Congratulations!! My wife and I will surely return, the only point to highlight are the menus written in pen, it looks a bit tacky to be honest, otherwise everything is great!!!"
ChIJNQEOLFspQg0RTOWrs4oOzxQ,1,"A disappointment. The staff is not very pleasant and not at all decisive, they do not know what goes into breakfast.
When I ask about colacao or if it is included in the breakfast menu they tell me no.
Since when is colacao not a breakfast?
Also, I would have appreciated if they had given me some solution, such as the colacao included for 20 cent more. I ended up drinking the milk alone.
The only positive thing is that the toasts were good and large."
ChIJNQEOLFspQg0RTOWrs4oOzxQ,4,"In the mornings the ideal place for a quick and delicious coffee, the waiter very polite and professional.
For ‚Ç¨1 you have a coffee with milk."
ChIJNQEOLFspQg0RTOWrs4oOzxQ,5,"Bar in the Moncloa interchange with very affordable prices.
Breakfast with a coffee with milk and two pieces of toast for ‚Ç¨4. Very rich‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJw2IeIIQpQg0RMmTsdVqYZVs,5,"Very tasty food (arepa and epanadas), lovely customer service. Thank you ladies :)
Ps. Location -2 level at metro st."
ChIJw2IeIIQpQg0RMmTsdVqYZVs,5,"This place, the food and the great service take me back in time to my childhood in Caracas, Venezuela."
ChIJw2IeIIQpQg0RMmTsdVqYZVs,5,"I'm from Manchester and I found this place, very kind people, excellent service and tasty empanadas"
ChIJw2IeIIQpQg0RMmTsdVqYZVs,5,"Great food ,friendly service"
ChIJw2IeIIQpQg0RMmTsdVqYZVs,4,
ChIJp0HRnjQpQg0RwUDS6EjBbs4,1,"Today I got one of the beverages in a glass. However there was lip stick still on the glass from previous client. So sad to see this at one of the iconic brands of Spain.

Stay safe and use disposable glasses at this outlet."
ChIJp0HRnjQpQg0RwUDS6EjBbs4,1,"If you are not Spanish, just don't go there. They are so rude, laughing at your pronunciation of Spanish. If you are girl especially, they are mocking you to your face directly. You will pay not for your sandwich, but for awful experience. They ruined the image of Spain and Rodilla."
ChIJp0HRnjQpQg0RwUDS6EjBbs4,5,Ok
ChIJp0HRnjQpQg0RwUDS6EjBbs4,4,Good Sandwich ü•™
ChIJp0HRnjQpQg0RwUDS6EjBbs4,2,"Super small space, the tables are too close together and to get out of your chair you have to brush your coat and your ass against all the plates on the table next to you. Food, like any knee. Yes, very friendly staff."
ChIJle0JXEUoQg0RS5eOtE9Yxlk,4,A good example of the classic spanish bar/restaurant that does just what it says on the tin. Good food. Ask for a beer and they put a very decent tapa. Prices are reasonable and service is speedy
ChIJle0JXEUoQg0RS5eOtE9Yxlk,4,Gobolem was a good coffee shop. They serve good coffee as well as great sangria. Their tortilla is also wonderful.
ChIJle0JXEUoQg0RS5eOtE9Yxlk,4,"Good food but uneven, meaning, some times is quite good, some times just about it."
ChIJle0JXEUoQg0RS5eOtE9Yxlk,4,Nice quick and effective service. The terrace is quite nice
ChIJle0JXEUoQg0RS5eOtE9Yxlk,5,"Treating some visitors, nice terrace and excellent food."
ChIJcREUWUMoQg0RBNwZ7xq_tLs,1,"A truly horrible place, we booked 6 weeks in advance, my son‚Äôs birthday. They offered us only a table on the street and treated us with arrogance and indifference. A toxic and entitled culture, stay away"
ChIJcREUWUMoQg0RBNwZ7xq_tLs,1,"Apparently they're fine with keeping the entire neighbourhood awake until 2am most nights, but if you want to get a drink at your ""local"" yourself for once the service is as rude and unhelpful as they can possibly be.
Have some respect and consideration for the people affected by your business (aka let them sleep at the very least on working days!) - and maybe look after them if they already come down to have a drink themselves at your establishment once in a while to maintain some form of good spirit in the neighbourhood!"
ChIJcREUWUMoQg0RBNwZ7xq_tLs,4,"Bare essentials for the ever lasting student in us:a broad choice of drinks, student-like, giant tv screen and tapas student-like. Nice no luxe."
ChIJcREUWUMoQg0RBNwZ7xq_tLs,5,Super
ChIJcREUWUMoQg0RBNwZ7xq_tLs,3,Excellent.
ChIJMzV8nFsoQg0RUgHPRDZnK-Y,5,"It‚Äôs worth going for the ALCACHOFAS CRUJIENT & TORREZNOS alone. But everything we had was quite good. More details on the picture captions.

I only removed one star for slow service. It took us a while to get the menu even if we were one of the first for dinner service at 8:15."
ChIJMzV8nFsoQg0RUgHPRDZnK-Y,2,"Menu of the day is a gamble - no way to predict the quality of the food.
My wife ordered seabass - it was alright.
I ordered grilled beef - it came undercooked, couldn't slice or chew it. After more cooking it was okay, still partially rare.
No way to choose a side for the main course - didn't know what we are getting until we saw it.
Salads were good.
For ‚Ç¨14.50 you get a salad, a main dish and a drink of your choice. That's all"
ChIJMzV8nFsoQg0RUgHPRDZnK-Y,5,"Very atmospheric restaurant, waiters are friendly and can speak English, decoration is beautiful. All the food we ordered are delicious, I can taste they are very fresh, the sweet and good favour in the meat."
ChIJMzV8nFsoQg0RUgHPRDZnK-Y,4,"The dishes were delicious with good quality, the service was fine. We had men√∫ del d√≠a in the restaurant for ‚Ç¨14.5 per person. If you want to have men√∫ del d√≠a, you won't be able to reserve the table according the restaurant policy. So you can only go there in the moment, and the staff will tell you that you can only stay 1 hour. That remark didn't sound so friendly -- maybe they were just busy."
ChIJMzV8nFsoQg0RUgHPRDZnK-Y,5,"This has to be one of the best places in Madrid! They have a very large daily specials list with the freshest food! plus, they are great at adapting the portions so that you can try as many different plates as you'd like :)"
ChIJ79dcokQoQg0RbnNLugFL100,5,"Amazing food and service.  We had a beautiful salad, fish stew and monk fish‚Ä¶. All were well prepared.  We topped the meal off with Fruit Carpaccio‚Ä¶. It was perfect and melted in my mouth."
ChIJ79dcokQoQg0RbnNLugFL100,3,"The restaurant is nice and quiet.
None of the waiters spoke English despite a website that proposes an English version. We did manage anyway :)
If you book a table for 8pm they are not ready to sit you when you arrive at 8pm and you have to wait and they did not even asked us if we want to order a drink while waiting. The seafood in the paella was great but the rice was barely cooked. I guess if you come a bit later it runs more smoothly."
ChIJ79dcokQoQg0RbnNLugFL100,5,This is place beautiful and nice. Service is amazing and lovely food. Thank you so much for great experience and see you soon.
ChIJ79dcokQoQg0RbnNLugFL100,5,"Awesome! Great steak, excellent Calamari, and super fresh seafood options! The wine card... Super!"
ChIJ79dcokQoQg0RbnNLugFL100,5,"This place is nice, cozy and strongly client oriented. The food was delicious, and the service was just superb. Our family was happy to pay a visit. Once we are in Madrid again we'll be back."
ChIJ9ZWK4VsoQg0ReXWbwummP-4,5,"Excellent, traditional restaurant in Madrid.
I went early on a Sunday night, which in hindsight was not the best idea. Food and service were great but because I was the only one there (my fault, not theirs) I sadly missed the hustle and bustle that they normally have. I recommend going a bit later, and with a few people so you can sample more of the delicious food."
ChIJ9ZWK4VsoQg0ReXWbwummP-4,5,"I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs like actually being in Asturias. But to get here it is just a short ride from the city center. After we waited for the roller doors to come up, inside this narrow, small and straightforward restaurant, early in the night, Do√±a Julia finishes her meal, stands up, and walks over to the kitchen to start cooking. Her berberechos were magic, the habitas con morcilla hatachana was so good it still haunts me (although it‚Äôs very rich so I recommend it is shared with restraint), and though I‚Äôve never been to Asturias, I knew their fabada made me taste the real thing."
ChIJ9ZWK4VsoQg0ReXWbwummP-4,5,Great spot for Asturian food. The food was great and there was a lot of choice too.
ChIJ9ZWK4VsoQg0ReXWbwummP-4,5,Amazing bean soups and all the spoon dishes. Plenty of sitting and also available for reservations.
ChIJ9ZWK4VsoQg0ReXWbwummP-4,5,"A small local restaurant with great service, food, and overall experience!
I‚Äôm truly recommend this place . If you go to Madrid don‚Äôt forget to pass by this place."
ChIJf7GTX0UoQg0RaXxQb8zKn4g,5,"What a great experience! We celebrated our anniversary here, and were treated like kings from start to finish. The food and wine were abundant and delicious, the ambience relaxing and welcoming, the service impeccable in every regard. We look forward to visiting these guys again!"
ChIJf7GTX0UoQg0RaXxQb8zKn4g,5,Food great. Service fantastic
ChIJf7GTX0UoQg0RaXxQb8zKn4g,5,"Excellent and professional service from owner Paolo, who's always very attentive to clients requests and needs. Good value for money with high quality and traditional preparation of Spanish and international cuisine, in a comfortable quiet and relaxing dinning room."
ChIJf7GTX0UoQg0RaXxQb8zKn4g,5,"Nice ambience, great staff, great food.  The kind of place you go for a special date night!  Highly recommended!"
ChIJf7GTX0UoQg0RaXxQb8zKn4g,5,great hosting guest
ChIJRemIU0UoQg0RUyflzVjeLDI,1,Terrible service. I waited a long time to get a table and there was no staff to. When I got a table I waited about 20 minutes and no one came to my table to get my order. Staff literally ignored my table. Very disappointing.
ChIJRemIU0UoQg0RUyflzVjeLDI,3,"In my latest visit the service was attentive and friendly although not lighting fast, as has always been the case in the franchise. I used to be a regular customer but  since the latest ownership change the quality has decreased, as the size of the portions while prices has increased. As a customer I feel been treated as stupid when they change the dishes and bowls to reduce the amount of food, or restructure the menu to charge more disguised on ""a la carte"" option. In any case in my visit to the cafeteria I must say the waiter were really attentive and helpful. And its one of the few places where they realice having power sockets available is a almost a must today (Actually this was exactly the reason I visited the place after months of not going to a VIPS)"
ChIJRemIU0UoQg0RUyflzVjeLDI,3,The service there is ridiculously slow especially in the morning. you pretty much have to get up and grab the attention of the waiter before they serve you. dont get me wrong the people are very nice but it can be very annoying especially since in my country we are served immediately after we sent down.
ChIJRemIU0UoQg0RUyflzVjeLDI,3,"nice place to have a good portioned breakfast in Madrid for a good price. It was the system of payment which is not so good...only one person can receive payment and thus if she is busy with other clients, you will have to waaaaaaaaaiiiiiittttttr :-)"
ChIJRemIU0UoQg0RUyflzVjeLDI,3,"They have apparently decided to devote themselves to their core business: dropped the newspaper-Stand and spread (too thin) to family Groups and corporate-Dinners satisfaction, exclusively.
In the way, have regrettably forgotten nevertheless to  UPDATE  their wireless-connection to latest WiFi stds 802.11-ac -ax, so noone can possibly hook up to fast internet Providers (unless passing through a much slower 802.11-n class-Router, which just happens to be a very very  OBSOLETE  technology from late XXth C.!)
Came on guys, you can do better... it will cost you peanuts, really."
ChIJE3ZTAEUoQg0RAJJcbT5xK8w,5,This place was a delightful culinary experience. We enjoyed tapas with friends and were pleased to savor the flavors of Spain in each bite!! Even the desserts were a dream! It's on the pricier side but worth the money. Yum
ChIJE3ZTAEUoQg0RAJJcbT5xK8w,5,"I didn't order a thing! My colleagues ordered, in consultation with the excellent waiter. I just ate and drank. Beautiful delicious wonderful. Highly recommended."
ChIJE3ZTAEUoQg0RAJJcbT5xK8w,2,"Great Tortilla. The waiters are not nice, no smiles at all, verious serious faces, feels like they are doing a favour serving you"
ChIJE3ZTAEUoQg0RAJJcbT5xK8w,4,Very well elaborated tapas. Tasty and authentic. Service a vit dissapointing.
ChIJE3ZTAEUoQg0RAJJcbT5xK8w,5,"Delicious food, great service, lovely location. Brilliant!"
ChIJzfMG50IoQg0RsaBihtejRu4,5,"Quality, variety and friendliness. In addition, great professionals preparing the product. With home delivery."
ChIJzfMG50IoQg0RsaBihtejRu4,5,A top product at a good price. Highly recommended
ChIJzfMG50IoQg0RsaBihtejRu4,5,"High quality product, very friendly service and, also, the possibility of tasting their genre in situ, prepared with great care by Jose, Puri and a whole team of people who are turning the Guzm√°n el Bueno market into a place of pilgrimage for me when it comes to eating good fish."
ChIJzfMG50IoQg0RsaBihtejRu4,5,"Great quality of their products, they bring the best for their customers. Products for all budgets with a wide variety at any time of the year.
Always excellent and pleasant treatment. They are wonderful"
ChIJzfMG50IoQg0RsaBihtejRu4,5,"My lifelong fishmonger, in fact I don't buy fish unless it's here.
The customer service and friendliness are exceptional, both from the owners Pepi and Jos√© and from the employees.
Perfect cleaning and excellent quality of products at prices in line with the environment."
ChIJP64oB0QoQg0RJvugWOFGpIc,5,"spicy like a lot , good idea for sauce. Good personal, all clean,"
ChIJP64oB0QoQg0RJvugWOFGpIc,4,"And I think the food quality is not good. Also, the fries, onion rings, nuggets  and wings are very oily. The salad only consists of tomato and lettuce"
ChIJP64oB0QoQg0RJvugWOFGpIc,3,The men's bathroom is fulled of mosquitoes everywhere and that thing I feel like never coming back.
ChIJP64oB0QoQg0RJvugWOFGpIc,5,Quite and Peaceful at time of sunset
ChIJP64oB0QoQg0RJvugWOFGpIc,1,I have ordered 2 times on ubereats and it never arrived! SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS BURGER KING!!!
ChIJjy6W1kUoQg0RUqX0ZVZ4JZk,3,"the service was slow even though the place wasn't busy. cesar salad and fries had a fishy taste, it wasn't bad, just not something we wanted"
ChIJjy6W1kUoQg0RUqX0ZVZ4JZk,5,Excellent food great atmosphere well with a visit highly recommend this place
ChIJjy6W1kUoQg0RUqX0ZVZ4JZk,4,"Surprisingly good for lunch with a ‚Ç¨18 fixed menu, where you can combine three courses in different ways. Good service during a busy afternoon."
ChIJjy6W1kUoQg0RUqX0ZVZ4JZk,5,Went in quickly to grab a bite. Staff friendly and the food was excellent! Didn't look like much inside but was pleasantly surprised!
ChIJjy6W1kUoQg0RUqX0ZVZ4JZk,5,"Pleasant environment, excellent varied menu. friendly service."
ChIJzaFUdlsoQg0R9Rq_tFBOHsw,5,Best tortilla I've had in a long time. The manager collected it for us from their sister restaurant and I will be back for more! Great service and spacious terrace.
ChIJzaFUdlsoQg0R9Rq_tFBOHsw,4,Really like a lot this place. It is pretty nice to have some chill drinks. Being at the terrace is what I most recommend. Also the food is okey. And prices are okey. Not the best service but it is okey.
ChIJzaFUdlsoQg0R9Rq_tFBOHsw,4,Great spot for Tapas. Very relaxed.
ChIJzaFUdlsoQg0R9Rq_tFBOHsw,5,"Highly recommended for BIRTHDAYS üéÇ
Yesterday I celebrated my birthday there and they only provided us with facilities other than offering us quality and good treatment.
Everyone kept telling me how great the place was.
Thank you very much for giving your all, we will be back ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ChIJzaFUdlsoQg0R9Rq_tFBOHsw,5,"We came to celebrate a birthday and they treated us very well, all the waiters were very nice and very attentive. The carrot cake is amazing! I will return without a doubt."
ChIJV2fMu0MoQg0RmEbfcI024Zw,3,"Well i am not a big fan of fancy empanadas outlets but my experience with this place was just ok. They have wide varieties of empanadas and some Argentina beers to go on with. I tried their mozzarella and tomato(carprese) empanada which was looking delicious on the first look but when i cut it in half I noticed that it was not fully cooked. The shell of the empanada was underbaked and that was really disappointing. Although the filling was perfect and delicious, the mozzarella and tomato filling with spices seemed to be fresh and overall empanadas seemed to be freshly baked but I couldn‚Äôt enjoyed it because of underbaked dough."
ChIJV2fMu0MoQg0RmEbfcI024Zw,5,"LOVE these empanadas so much! One day I hope to make it through the whole menu. There is a flavor for everyone and each one is PERFECT‚Äî highly recommend the classic jam√≥n y queso and the carne picante!!

For more food recs, follow @twicefriedweiss on Instagram!"
ChIJV2fMu0MoQg0RmEbfcI024Zw,5,Really stellar. I love the creative empanada flavors. The smash burger and the traditional Argentine one were both great. I wish we had this in NYC!!
ChIJV2fMu0MoQg0RmEbfcI024Zw,4,Very tasty finger food. Good fuel for a walking tour. Good selection to choose from based on your preference or dietary requirements
ChIJV2fMu0MoQg0RmEbfcI024Zw,4,so many different options and super cute place! the best one was the piamonte
ChIJLUwTBkUoQg0R0a-na72-XCs,4,"It was a delicious stop while we were awaiting results from the hospital. Walking distance. The Nacho Mountain was great and I got a thee taco sampler. All were quite good - one beef, one shrimp, one chicken.  But you can choose any combo you want.
The server was super kind. The decoration was energizing and attactive."
ChIJLUwTBkUoQg0R0a-na72-XCs,5,Awesome dress up night: Halloween in Spain!. We came because of the trip adviser reviews and the staff and food did not disappoint. Margaritas were perfect and decorated with fun!
ChIJLUwTBkUoQg0R0a-na72-XCs,5,"What can I say. Words can‚Äôt describe the experience I had here. Only have a photo of the nachos because I inhaled the delicious pork burrito. I was unsure of what I wanted but the server Alesso helped me with everything, he apologised for his English not being great. But it was perfect. The food he prepared beautifully and had the flavour to match.

Everything was reasonably priced, the restaurant was clean. Would recommend and will be definitely coming back."
ChIJLUwTBkUoQg0R0a-na72-XCs,3,"This place has a lot of options for tacos and burritos but they don‚Äôt even serve lemon, spicy sauces or salt! They have too much going on that they forgot about the basics!
They have a cute scenario for pictures but I don‚Äôt recommend it. Also I ordered shrimp tacos and they tasted old and nasty üò∞üò¢"
ChIJLUwTBkUoQg0R0a-na72-XCs,5,My favorite place to eat in Madrid. Sandy‚Äôs the best and always gives great service.
ChIJXTJhG0UoQg0R3Kn7l9Cd7Is,1,"I ordered secreto iberico. It was the worst I ever had ( no flavour and too over cooked)
I also ordered caz√≥n en adobo and it was not.  It was sort of fishball with a sauce that was only there to hide the bad qualityof the no+fish so it was better without."
ChIJXTJhG0UoQg0R3Kn7l9Cd7Is,5,Fantastic simple food and a lovely small space. Staff were friendly and welcoming and enjoying their time.
ChIJXTJhG0UoQg0R3Kn7l9Cd7Is,5,good place for soe idiots time with friends and watching football matches
ChIJXTJhG0UoQg0R3Kn7l9Cd7Is,4,"good service and very decent food

ChIJXTJhG0UoQg0R3Kn7l9Cd7Is,1,"Nice wait staff, but horrible food."
ChIJrc4_X0MoQg0RxHMFue5Plz8,5,"I was told this pizzeria was super delicious, and it was right!!!
I was alone and ordered ‚Äúpizza de las casa‚Äù and a ‚Äútinto de verano‚Äù, it was a fantastic meal, and even there was only one pizzaiolo in the kitchen and the restaurant was quite full at the moment I arrived, the service was quite fast.
Really good experience!
Will come back üòé"
ChIJrc4_X0MoQg0RxHMFue5Plz8,4,Awesome services and foods but summer red is a bit disappointing
ChIJrc4_X0MoQg0RxHMFue5Plz8,5,"Lucia - A really good waitress, lovely person, amazing service - amazing food and drink. Muchos gracias"
ChIJrc4_X0MoQg0RxHMFue5Plz8,5,"Great visit, lovely pizza and fantastic service from staff."
ChIJrc4_X0MoQg0RxHMFue5Plz8,5,Great vibes. Great service. Very friendly and fun staff. Great gluten free pizza options!
ChIJk9fPtUMoQg0Rb2g_p1Tt68o,5,"I had a kebab chicken and another meat.
Really enjoyed"
ChIJk9fPtUMoQg0Rb2g_p1Tt68o,5,Really nice foodand also cheap. Easily reachable from Moncloa metro station
ChIJk9fPtUMoQg0Rb2g_p1Tt68o,1,Horrible
ChIJk9fPtUMoQg0Rb2g_p1Tt68o,5,"Excellent, very cozy place, pleasant service, abundant dishes."
ChIJk9fPtUMoQg0Rb2g_p1Tt68o,5,"I think it's good for ‚Ç¨7.5 and it's good
The nice waiter
I like the site"
ChIJjcMIy0MoQg0RnBj9aefGjq8,5,"We saw a post in Reddit about it and my son loved it. We are from India and the person who was making was very kind. We are here for few more days, we will go back and eat again . üòÑüëç"
ChIJjcMIy0MoQg0RnBj9aefGjq8,4,"Cheapest Pizza!

Much better than Papizza üòÅ Only 1‚Ç¨ for bigger slice! Super cheap, open until late, quick service. What else do we need for partying?"
ChIJjcMIy0MoQg0RnBj9aefGjq8,5,Cheap and best pizzas.. Prefer take away..
ChIJjcMIy0MoQg0RnBj9aefGjq8,5,Super nice guy!
ChIJjcMIy0MoQg0RnBj9aefGjq8,1,"Tremendous lack of hygiene.

I placed an order and it arrived just as it appears in the photos: 2 underwear without a box in a bag that who knows where it came from. Of course I did not accept delivery.
I called the store and their response was that ""they didn't have any boxes left and that their boss told them to send it that way."" I don't know, didn't you at least think of wrapping them in aluminum foil?
Ascazo. Who knows what I've eaten before, because it wasn't the first order I made from this place, but it was certainly the last."
ChIJKchOhkEoQg0R7_696kWGOz8,5,Alexandra was the perfect host. Helped us with our Spanish. The food was wonderful.
ChIJKchOhkEoQg0R7_696kWGOz8,5,Delicious... The pitz Awesome.... Loved the place üòé.
ChIJKchOhkEoQg0R7_696kWGOz8,4,"This restaurant is our favorite place to eat. Kids friendly, stroller friendly. The staff are nice. The food is delicious and inexpensive."
ChIJKchOhkEoQg0R7_696kWGOz8,5,The best pizza and pasta and service. Truly one of my favorite meals I had the pleasure of eating in Madrid!
ChIJKchOhkEoQg0R7_696kWGOz8,4,"I had the pesto and ham pasta salad and I really enjoyed it. The service was great and the environment was quiet and relaxed. My friends got pizza and really enjoyed it. Super, yummy thin crust."
ChIJT0268YAoQg0RF_clU8mvmAE,1,"Stroganoff for 5 euro ü§£ü•¥ do this people know what is stroganoff? They mix chicken, beef and mix it with rice and some mushrooms looks more likes dog food"
ChIJT0268YAoQg0RF_clU8mvmAE,5,Best sangria in Madrid!!! We went to Taberna del Chato a few times while in Madrid and they definitely have the best sangria in town. The service was amazing and they were very good with remembering and accommodating dietary requirements. The food was beautifully presented and really delicious! Highly recommend this spot.
ChIJT0268YAoQg0RF_clU8mvmAE,5,"Cute little place, very welcoming, great hosts. The food - I had croquettes, chicken and cod - is tasty. They offer a selection of smaller bites, perfect for a small dinner sided with a glass of wine. I had a wonderful time and I would definitely eat here again."
ChIJT0268YAoQg0RF_clU8mvmAE,5,Taberna del Chapo is agreat Tapas Bar in Madrid. They serve their dishes in a original and innovative way. Looks good! The food is really cheap so you can order all across the menu! Also the selfmade Sangria is delicious. The hosts were very friendly. Would come again anytime!
ChIJT0268YAoQg0RF_clU8mvmAE,5,Staff was really friendly and it has a great atmosphere! It was our first night & tapas bar in Madrid and we absolutely loved it!! :) We ordered all different tapas and they are all tasty! They have menu in English.
ChIJJZI6s0MoQg0R00BnSHvh2AQ,5,Burritos
ChIJJZI6s0MoQg0R00BnSHvh2AQ,1,"The worst fast food place in Madrid, they serve me kebab meat with an ice cream scoop and then for the bus. It's terrible, don't eat here"
ChIJJZI6s0MoQg0R00BnSHvh2AQ,2,"I'm sorry, but I didn't like the food and drink I was served at all."
ChIJJZI6s0MoQg0R00BnSHvh2AQ,4,"Now called Entrepanes, it is a site that fills a gap in the area, being dynamic and current.
They offer pizzas, hot dogs, burritos and potato omelettes among other dishes, which are good.
It is not expensive and its staff manages to multiply to serve customers."
ChIJJZI6s0MoQg0R00BnSHvh2AQ,4,"A well-appointed establishment with a good location. You can order craft beers to accompany the food at the establishment next door, which is owned by the same owner. If you order a nude, they serve you the burrito without the fajita on a plate to recycle. You choose the composition of the burrito. to your liking among many options. Copious quantity per person. Friendly service. It is not tasting food but there are certain hours when the place is packed."
ChIJqwQ2s0MoQg0R1VQRrc3iJMY,5,"my comfort place at 4am after the club, cheap pizza (don't drop it on the ground!!) and other fast food. careful there are a lot of drunk people nearby from the clubs so keep your friends close!"
ChIJqwQ2s0MoQg0R1VQRrc3iJMY,1,"Got food poisoning from the hot dog and spent the entire next day externalising my internalities.

On the plus side: Friendly staff and good entertainment in the form of a street fight almost breaking out right outside :)

Maybe go, but dont eat."
ChIJqwQ2s0MoQg0R1VQRrc3iJMY,5,"Entrepanes 24h proved to be a culinary lifesaver after leaving the theater late with no nearby dining options. The kindness of the girl who took our order over the phone and the efficiency of the delivery person, who delivered the delicious food to our hotel 14 kilometers away, impressed us. Highly recommended for those seeking a reliable option even in last-minute situations."
ChIJqwQ2s0MoQg0R1VQRrc3iJMY,5,"Excellent food and customer service especially calling after 12am, happy experience overall hope to have experiences like this in the future."
ChIJqwQ2s0MoQg0R1VQRrc3iJMY,5,"If you want a genuine taste of Argentina in Madrid, do not miss Empanadas Malvon with a chilled Quilmes."
ChIJzTmLRkIoQg0Rg0iPY_aQIhc,3,This is place and all of its franchises are great for a beer and little snacks but the 100% disappointing part is not being allowed to put the tables together. We usually walk away when there‚Äôs a group of more than 5 people. Enjoy if going alone or less than 4 people
ChIJzTmLRkIoQg0Rg0iPY_aQIhc,3,It's fine if you know what you're getting. The beer is bad but for ‚Ç¨1.50 what do you expect? Don't eat whatever you do.
ChIJzTmLRkIoQg0Rg0iPY_aQIhc,4,"The food is really good and the prices are amazing, it's super cheap. However, for that same reason you need to wait a little bit sometimes."
ChIJzTmLRkIoQg0Rg0iPY_aQIhc,4,Very good place for a good beer and some food. The prices are economical and there is lots of young people.
ChIJzTmLRkIoQg0Rg0iPY_aQIhc,4,"Quite busy on Wednesday and Sunday but good food and very fast, also quite cheap"
ChIJ62WGvUEoQg0REwkJzMzPsYQ,4,cookies penjamin & oreo king fusion ü§≠üíØ
ChIJ62WGvUEoQg0REwkJzMzPsYQ,2,"The slowest Burger King ever üò≠ I mean, people have a bus to catch‚Ä¶"
ChIJ62WGvUEoQg0REwkJzMzPsYQ,5,They don't have bathroom or free refills and are usually crowded
ChIJ62WGvUEoQg0REwkJzMzPsYQ,1,"Go somewhere else, then you say you fat"
ChIJ62WGvUEoQg0REwkJzMzPsYQ,2,very bad service.
ChIJBYi8I0IoQg0RUkIQ8PYdgHM,1,"Strong smell of toilet in the rooms. The knife and fork where dirty, and even when I requested replacement, the knife where not clean again. All the environment (floor, tables) could be cleaner. And broken chair.... The food: salad where great. Main dish where something terrible (mix of rice with sausages, pork, egg,  some stiff vegetables, and too many spices)."
ChIJBYi8I0IoQg0RUkIQ8PYdgHM,5,The waiter that help us tonight was superb! Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt manage to get his name but he tried his best to communicate with us with the language barrier that we had and even managed to recommend us food that was so great!
ChIJBYi8I0IoQg0RUkIQ8PYdgHM,3,"Decent menu of the day: I ordered watermelon soup with ham crumbs and it was okay. The main dish was rice with seafood, it was tasty, the rice a little bit over cooked though."
ChIJBYi8I0IoQg0RUkIQ8PYdgHM,5,Very nice breakfast in Madrid üá™üá∏
ChIJBYi8I0IoQg0RUkIQ8PYdgHM,5,Had tapas and drinks on a Sunday night. Food is varied and good quality. Service was good as well. Nice neighborhood spot.
ChIJlcU57EIoQg0RwVuGDobOnFo,5,The menu is excellent value for money and service is fast and friendly - been several times
ChIJlcU57EIoQg0RwVuGDobOnFo,4,"I went there often in 1984, I lived in the same street.  Menu for 300 pesetas. Was always good.
I have gone back and they recognized me.  I adore that place.
Next trip to Madrid and I will lunch in La Tuna."
ChIJlcU57EIoQg0RwVuGDobOnFo,5,"The old man listening to the TV on loud volume is the definition of atmosphere. Food is fresh, food is good, the options for menu del d√≠a are more varied than some restaurants whole menus, and it is also dirt cheap. They don't mention that wine and bread is included, so they're not trying to scam anyone - just trying to feed them."
ChIJlcU57EIoQg0RwVuGDobOnFo,4,"This is not high gourmet quality but for some 11 euro you can have an excellent menu of the day consisting of two courses plus dessert plus drink (water, wine, beer...). For instance today starters were Russian Salad or peas with ham or pistol manchego (mixed vegetables) or white beans with sausage or chard or crab salad that I remember. Main course was grilled salmon or fried whole rooster or villaroy breasts grilled chicken etc. Dessert was ice cream or melon or watermelon or cherries or chocolate cake or banana. One bear or glass of wine 11 euro. Do not expect them to speak English but expect a home made good product range menu."
ChIJlcU57EIoQg0RwVuGDobOnFo,4,"Good meal, location has A/C and food is typical and tasty. Very friendly staff too."
ChIJOXBo9kIoQg0RZheLoFViFSY,5,"We had their famous plate of potato chips and Iberian meat along with chicken and 4 sauces, and mixed croquetas. Everything was delicious. A pre-meal starter was also tasty. The place is really atmospheric thanks to the staff who were very friendly, spoke English and some Polish (which was a nice surprise) We‚Äôd deffo dine there again üëç"
ChIJOXBo9kIoQg0RZheLoFViFSY,3,A busy little bar. Salty food. Cheap beers. Lots of young folks hanging out. Not a bad place to swing by.
ChIJOXBo9kIoQg0RZheLoFViFSY,5,Amazing food with a lot of sauces to choose from!!! Perfect if you‚Äôre craving for meat üòã
ChIJOXBo9kIoQg0RZheLoFViFSY,5,"The place had a nice atmosphere, we went there for dinner, and there was a match at that time, which they did play. The food, great! The size of the Tabla is dependent on how many sauces you choose, but you can repeat. We did 8 sauces and 2 meats (chicken and entrecot). Our favorite was the Entrecot with the chimichurri sauce."
ChIJOXBo9kIoQg0RZheLoFViFSY,4,"Fun place to come for a quick bite and drinks. The pork was so soft and delicious, flavored perfectly. We also got their sausage. We recommend getting the Gandario salsa. It was our favorite! Also the mozzarella fingers came with raspberry jam which went well together."
ChIJzftpF0IoQg0R4Pzc45KcB8Q,5,"We came for breakfast and it was delicious! Great prices and clean atmosphere. Friendly and quick service. Highly recommend. I ordered pancakes with bacon, egg, and truffle b√©chamel sauce and my husband ordered an avocado toast with a poached egg. Very good!!"
ChIJzftpF0IoQg0R4Pzc45KcB8Q,5,"Very spacious place, with plenty of comfortable sofas available.
We were answered very fast by the waitress, who also didn't take long to take our order.

We got the CachoPower (cachopo with eggs, dried tomatoes, lettuce and jalape√±o) and the sliders combo (quesadillas, chicken fingers, nachos, chicken wings and sauces). To drink, a beer and a vanilla milk-shake.

The portions were big enough to satisfy us and the service was really fast (we felt that the waitress should've been a little less ""hasty"" when taking orders though).

Either way, I totally recommend the place!"
ChIJzftpF0IoQg0R4Pzc45KcB8Q,5,"As a foreigner who has lived in Spain for many years, I recommend everyone to try this brand of restaurant. The taste is good, creative new dishes are often introduced, and the price is affordable, and the plates are large."
ChIJzftpF0IoQg0R4Pzc45KcB8Q,4,"The food was better than expected. Good choices, medium prices. Average atmosphere."
ChIJzftpF0IoQg0R4Pzc45KcB8Q,2,"Used to come to VIPS very often years ago and I used to like it. Maybe I am not the target anymore. In any case, I ordered the VIPS club smash and the dish did not just have a terrible presentation, but the fries were cold, the bread was partially burnt and the meat was so done that it was dry."
ChIJg2ikr1woQg0R9xnby9KxGiQ,2,"If you're looking for a cheap place in Madrid, it might be a good choice. Staff is very friendly, toilets were clean, and the place is cozy in general, but quite small.
In regard to the food itself, I would say that its quality is average. I tried a wide range of the tapas, all of them were large portions, however Mini hamburgers came cold, chicken fingers and croquettes were both too fatty. Eggs with ham tasted too salty (try them with blood sausage instead). Lac√≥n came not as hot as I expected, with tons of paprika and low quality olive oil (Actually I still think that it was sunflower oil or some other vegetable oil), and the Spanish omelette was a flavourless thing. From my point of view, only the pork sirloin was OK. Summarising, good for cheap eats with your group of friends, but don't expect an awesome food experience..."
ChIJg2ikr1woQg0R9xnby9KxGiQ,5,Good food and nice stuff. The place is quite small so is better to have a reservation during regular eating intervals.
ChIJg2ikr1woQg0R9xnby9KxGiQ,4,"We made a reservation for a group, they asked us in the reservation to decide what we were going to eat, we paid a deposit of course, I would have liked not to choose everything at once so that I could have tried more things on the menu. Barbara has been very kind and attentive. Very good attention. We were looking forward to trying grandma's cake, they had run out. The tails were very delicious, the chicken fingers were very good, they have a touch of beer, and the broken eggs were very good, a lot of them, we had a whole casserole left over. As a suggestion, the bagged potatoes that they serve as an appetizer, I don't know if they are homemade or not, don't leave them in the air all day, they become stale and you can tell that they are not fresh."
ChIJg2ikr1woQg0R9xnby9KxGiQ,5,"I have passed by this bar since it is the only one in this area that I have found and I did not want to go too far from this area because the supermarket is there that day and since I came to look for my boy who works in said supermarket and I also needed to go to the bathroom urgently and the truth is that I quite liked the atmosphere, the service and the friendly and helpful treatment of the girls who served me, which were B√°rbara and Milagritos. I will return. I have also needed to charge the phone and without any problem and very kindly they have put it on charge for a while. So I am very grateful for this favor and for all the good time that B√°rbara and Milagritos have given me."
ChIJg2ikr1woQg0R9xnby9KxGiQ,5,A cozy place where the food is very delicious and the waitress is charming.
ChIJG-i1mk8oQg0RTBx2JAnT66k,5,Very nice food. I will return.
ChIJG-i1mk8oQg0RTBx2JAnT66k,2,"Disappointed. Service is good, but food is pretty bland. Not recommended."
ChIJG-i1mk8oQg0RTBx2JAnT66k,4,Nice service! Good food.
ChIJG-i1mk8oQg0RTBx2JAnT66k,3,way too expensive for what it is. With a 50% discount its just a bit overpriced
ChIJG-i1mk8oQg0RTBx2JAnT66k,5,Excellent food and service
ChIJiUE1E0IoQg0RmwYBfT1sp0E,4,Good Japanese restaurant with affordable prices for a menu all included. I order the number 1 (there was also miso) and I paid 13‚Ç¨. Gyoza were a bit cold but the staff was very friendly
ChIJiUE1E0IoQg0RmwYBfT1sp0E,5,"Low key excellent ramen in Madrid üëåüèΩ don‚Äôt like the decoration and ambiance of the place too much but the food is amazing. If you want top ramen, this is the place"
ChIJiUE1E0IoQg0RmwYBfT1sp0E,5,"Got a great vegetarian option at this restaurant. Rice and sauteed vegetables and a side of green seaweed. Very light on the stomach and just simple beautiful food. The chopsticks became a joke because we requested for spoon and forküòÇ Ended our meal with jasmine tea... Just perfect. A young guy called Jason on the staff spoke English. He became our friend and was very helpful by giving suggestions.  Went there 3-4  times and they were always welcoming, friendly and very cheerful.

On our third visit, we had ramen noodles with vegetables. They offered a vegetarian sushi just for us. It was so good that we went back and just had sushi."
ChIJiUE1E0IoQg0RmwYBfT1sp0E,5,"Best üçú ramen in Madrid until proven otherwise (yes, better than Kagura). Their ramen bowls are huge and incredibly tasty! Also their üçõ Curry rice is 10/10!)
Oh! Make reservations! And you can order online via just eat as well."
ChIJiUE1E0IoQg0RmwYBfT1sp0E,4,"A true japanese restaurant in Madrid.

I did not like the squid tapanyaki. The calamari/cuttlefish tasted off, it was overcooked (chewy), and then it was cold. A complete shipwreck.

The octopus balls were delicious, and the hata drink flavour lichi was good and fun to open (there is a secret twist).

The waiters were very efficient, always smiling and friendly, great service."
ChIJv0YW01woQg0R40XswescKlQ,5,"This restaurant delivers a delightful Spanish cuisine that's a feast for both the eyes and taste buds! The place is not too crowded while we went for lunch during the weekend. We were served quite quickly. The prices are a good value for money for the quality offered, and the staff exudes genuine warmth. Don't miss out on this Spanish gem if you're in the area !"
ChIJv0YW01woQg0R40XswescKlQ,5,"High quality Spanish food, excellent service and food pricing. Really recommend paying a visit to this place."
ChIJv0YW01woQg0R40XswescKlQ,5,"What a surprise! Such a nice spot near Moncloa that isn't horribly busy and where food and drink are more than decent. The place is not big, so I would suggest going in small groups definitely. The food was very much to my liking and the beer was not a cheap rubbish one, no, good quality, same as the food. Incredible to see that there are still places that want to do very good and make the effort to do their best. Will definitely come back, one of the best in the area"
ChIJv0YW01woQg0R40XswescKlQ,5,"Very good bar, I really recommend it !
If you want to have a good time in Madrid, they are very kind and friendly with good food üòä
Thank you especially to Carlos, Nuria, Samira and Andy !!"
ChIJv0YW01woQg0R40XswescKlQ,2,The bar doesn't follow their menu and only has 1 option of beer.
ChIJJ3-PS1soQg0RfHZ4SM2UTYg,3,"Old school restaurant, small menu but tasty, they carry good wines."
ChIJJ3-PS1soQg0RfHZ4SM2UTYg,5,"Excellent place - we sat outside, food was great, service was excellent. Good prices and lots of excellent plates. Would go back again in an instant, more authentic than other places we found."
ChIJJ3-PS1soQg0RfHZ4SM2UTYg,1,"Really are you guys charging us for the ‚Äúaperitivo‚Äù? This is outrageous: ‚Äúis on the menu‚Äù . watch out if they will charge you for using the chair of the restaurant, we NEVER order the aperitive. The food was ok, but not 5stars for this price; my friend was having birthday and they couldn‚Äôt care less, it seem that we were bothering the waitress, as she looked annoyed any time at the table, never even offer a chupito, which is normal in Spanish restaurant, but of course we didn‚Äôt expect so much. Also noisy, so each one tries to speak loud to have a conversation, Bar de toda la vida? Only if you want to be mistreated your whole life. We‚Äôll never come back. Really bad experience."
ChIJJ3-PS1soQg0RfHZ4SM2UTYg,1,Terrible service and definitely not tourist-friendly. Tried to get a table here and the host was very rude and unwelcoming - the place was quite full and we asked if we could wait for a table but she said nothing inside or outside. I believe she was biased since we didn‚Äôt speak and Spanish.
ChIJJ3-PS1soQg0RfHZ4SM2UTYg,1,We were 15 minutes late for my husband's birthday lunch and they gave our table reservation away... And were especially snarky and mean about it. Granted we shouldn't have been late but it was a table a table for 2 and only 15 minutes. We won't be back....
ChIJSW3YcEIoQg0RKVlP_WRB_Hs,5,"They did some renovation to the space, and the owner might changed recently. Still the best kebab in town! üôåüèª

Shawarma and kebab remain the original taste and serving size, also the iconic salsa is still matching perfectly with the chips and the rolls. They made the dishes the same way as they did before.

The only part that we find a little different was the beef being leaner than before, and the chips are fried harder.

It‚Äôs very precious that they tried very hard to keep the spirit of Yunie Kebab in this restaurant. Suggest all who love kebab a visit ü´∂üèª"
ChIJSW3YcEIoQg0RKVlP_WRB_Hs,5,"Summary: 5 star Lebanese food. I discovered this place by coincidence, had a look inside and the food looked great, even though the place itself doesn‚Äôt look very attractive. But the food is absolutely delicious! We‚Äôve tried a vegetarian mezze plate, more than enough for 2 people, with great variety including hummus, mutabbal, falafel, salad. Meat shawarma was also super tasty, juicy and well accompanied with a special sauce. In addition, prices are pretty well balanced, it‚Äôs even cheap  compared to the quality. But since they only have 1 waiter, the service was pretty slow, yet the food is so delicious that it still deserves 5 stars, will definitely go back and try more dishes."
ChIJSW3YcEIoQg0RKVlP_WRB_Hs,5,"Amazing shawarma, in fact the best I have tried so far in Madrid. I will highly recommend, this place. They could add sauces per shawarma on the bag to go, we realized at home it was only one sauce there. Nevertheless it was really good."
ChIJSW3YcEIoQg0RKVlP_WRB_Hs,5,I felt like I stepped somewhere between the 70's and the 80's in a very familiar place. The owner cooks amazing shawarma and his wife is a lovely lady who made our visit a delight. People were corteous the food was great especially that it is the first time I get a good real shawarma...
ChIJSW3YcEIoQg0RKVlP_WRB_Hs,3,"I read about them in a blog about Lebanese food in Madrid. I was very disappointed by the chicken shawarma and the falafel gave my wife a stomach ache. We didn‚Äôt try the Kebab, maybe those are good. But I personally won‚Äôt recommend and will not go to this place again."
ChIJUXveK10oQg0RjP74hcJ1WfY,5,"I visited the cafe on a Saturday around noon for brunch and was lucky enough to get an outdoor table. The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and attentive. The brunch option included a main dish, dessert, coffee, and a drink‚Äîperfect for me, as I love both savory and sweet options. I liked their version/twist of the French toast and can recommend."
ChIJUXveK10oQg0RjP74hcJ1WfY,5,"Very nice and attentive staff. Tasty!
A lady noticed that I wanted to sit outside and when a table outside was freed, she offered me to relocate there, thank you so much!"
ChIJUXveK10oQg0RjP74hcJ1WfY,5,"I came here to work on an essay and ordered the earl grey tea. There is a great study/working environment with good wifi and many people with their laptops. they have a variety of good looking pastries. I also stayed for lunch and ordered the vegan burrito (there are several vegan options available) which had great flavor and healthy ingredients. I would definitely return here to study over either coffee, breakfast or lunch!"
ChIJUXveK10oQg0RjP74hcJ1WfY,5,A lovely little brunch spot a short walk from Moncloa.  It‚Äôs a very cosy space but it has a lovely atmosphere and great menu options for breakfast/brunch.  The food was fresh and beautifully presented.
ChIJUXveK10oQg0RjP74hcJ1WfY,5,"This little cafe packs a big punch.  The coffee drinks were perfect, the avocado toast excellent, the protein bowl super delish!  And everything else looks great, too.."
ChIJyUZxh0IoQg0RHTUq8Rg-JhQ,5,"Reiki with Amadeo, recommended by a friend, has helped me a lot. Listen very carefully to your problems, and then act on them. Among other things, the precision and efficiency of their techniques have caught my attention. They made my body release various tensions, and that is certainly something to appreciate."
ChIJyUZxh0IoQg0RHTUq8Rg-JhQ,5,"My experience with Reiki began by chance and without too many expectations, although with some curiosity. After a few months of contact I can confirm the benefit that your practice is having in improving my physical and mental balance.  A previously unknown door has been opened to a better and deeper knowledge of myself."
ChIJyUZxh0IoQg0RHTUq8Rg-JhQ,5,"Very good experience, the cardiac coherence technique has been phenomenal for me for stress and anxiety as well as reiki sessions."
ChIJyUZxh0IoQg0RHTUq8Rg-JhQ,5,Great professional!!! Very grateful for the support and dedication provided. Extensive knowledge of various techniques and treatments...highly recommended.
ChIJyUZxh0IoQg0RHTUq8Rg-JhQ,1,Little content and fundamental basis
ChIJrVGvd1soQg0ROaKMSs2SSCs,3,"I feel harsh rating this place as 3* as the waiter was very friendly and the food was really well presented. One of the meals was a bit bland and the other was almost entirely meat, it could have done with a bit more variety. As I said, presentation was great but if the duck dish had come with some potatoes, either mashed or saut√©ed, and slightly less meat then it would have made a far nicer meal. Obviously these are my opinions and others may differ but overall came away a little disappointed having looked at other reviews before going."
ChIJrVGvd1soQg0ROaKMSs2SSCs,5,What a wonderful place to have dinner!! Delicious food in a quiet beautiful neighborhood in Madrid! üíØ
ChIJrVGvd1soQg0ROaKMSs2SSCs,5,"Loved the food, I want to go back and try everything!, the portions are very generous so I could not order all I wanted to try, the wine list is very well selected and the service is friendly and attentive. Definitely a repeat for me and my party."
ChIJrVGvd1soQg0ROaKMSs2SSCs,5,Perfect option to try spanish food. Tortilla trufada and torreznos without doubt is a great option
ChIJrVGvd1soQg0ROaKMSs2SSCs,5,Somehow this restaurant got me to eat a pound of tomatoes. They were that good. The tomatoes and anchovies followed by the imberico steak was magnificent.
ChIJ41m8aVsoQg0RGZlEfABxwyQ,3,"Stopped by on a whim, as one of their second plates for their menu, beef with chimichurri, caught my attention! Though the menu was on the pricey side for 16‚Ç¨, I had their yummy seafood soupy rice that was delicious. Yet I was super disappointed in their second plate as the chimichurri salsa was not the traditional green sauce and ended up having no flavor with their beef being chewy and difficult to swallow. The waiter very attentive and kind.

Despite this place being nearly empty when I stopped by for early lunch, I was unable to have a window seat as all tables were nearly reserved. When a couple finished from a table by the window, I asked to move and instead of accommodating, the owner said that was reserved as well as he proceed to put the reserved sign on table. That lack of accommodation left a bad taste in my mouth and was ready to leave. The ambiance is not one that is welcoming as nearly all tables are reserved and it‚Äôs clear they aren‚Äôt interested in new business. Personally, not worth returning nor recommending."
ChIJ41m8aVsoQg0RGZlEfABxwyQ,4,"Perfectly fine experience... Recommendations ended up being way too much, I left alot of food on the plates, but we'll blame that on my lack of Spanish skills. The paella ""starter"" was best I've had anywhere in years!"
ChIJ41m8aVsoQg0RGZlEfABxwyQ,4,Outdoor sitting area next to the road. Spanish Meat and fish dishes from Santander city. Good quality in general except for the meat that was cold tasteless and hard to chew. Good service. A water spraying cooling system comes very handy in the summer heat.
ChIJ41m8aVsoQg0RGZlEfABxwyQ,5,Amazing Spanish food. Men√∫ del d√≠a 16 euros week days and 25 on the weekends.
ChIJ41m8aVsoQg0RGZlEfABxwyQ,4,Very good but overpriced.
ChIJP-tZ3k4oQg0R5Zaae4ozR60,1,"Terrible professional, unable to notify that he canceled his appointment with me by Doctoralia or email. I had an appointment with him at the Rosario Hospital and he did not have the decency to inform me that he was canceling the appointment..."
ChIJP-tZ3k4oQg0R5Zaae4ozR60,5,He personifies what a doctor should be. To a cutting-edge technical training he adds great humanity. I will never thank you enough for how you resolved my complex fracture
ChIJP-tZ3k4oQg0R5Zaae4ozR60,3,Expensive
ChIJP-tZ3k4oQg0R5Zaae4ozR60,5,
ChIJP-tZ3k4oQg0R5Zaae4ozR60,5,
ChIJQytGBkMoQg0RdXYZV2UwlZw,3,"The food was mostly good and the service was timely. I especially enjoyed the souffl√©. I do think the older gentleman who waits tables could be a little friendlier. Maybe I‚Äôm imagining things but when he sighed in frustration after seating me and barely acknowledged me when I thanked him while leaving, I got the feeling he doesn‚Äôt like tourists or something. That and the slightly higher-than-warranted prices keep it from being five stars."
ChIJQytGBkMoQg0RdXYZV2UwlZw,5,"The food and service were both excellent, I loved the pulpo! Paired well with a glass of Albari√±o wine."
ChIJQytGBkMoQg0RdXYZV2UwlZw,5,"Hi all, we went to Saladin restaurant following a friend recommendation to try their ‚Äútortilla de callos‚Äù. We arrived at lunch time and noticed the menu (lunch specials) were great and cheap (12‚Ç¨/person!) so we gave it a try. I will only say that we returned the following day, it is awesome. Normal menu (dinner) is also good to share some plates with friends or for a more formal meal. Great kitchen and Spanish confort  food. We will be back as soon as our travels allows!"
ChIJQytGBkMoQg0RdXYZV2UwlZw,2,"The lunch menu is expensive and really not good. Mainly there is bourgeois cuisine, but overall somewhat uncharitable. Example: fish without any sauce, oil or aioli. In addition a boiled potato also - no vegetables, simply completely joyless thrown on the plate, like in a canteen. Drinks go completely extra, rather unusual for lunch where a drink is usually included.

The audience is average retirement age and comparably the time of the restaurant has also stopped. You sit in the basement, which is not really nice, but if necessary, the cloth napkin is more important to some than good food. The waiter exudes from all pores that we are not worthy of his class. The friendly greeting to say goodbye was below his level.

Must be something for connoisseurs, for me there will not be a second time."
ChIJQytGBkMoQg0RdXYZV2UwlZw,5,A really nice restaurant with great service and food.
ChIJpyfChlsoQg0RL0g1BIQtNFo,5,"I took barbecue bocadillo and it was super juicy and tasty! Malaguenuo desserts are too sweet, but it's always good to try authentic things!"
ChIJpyfChlsoQg0RL0g1BIQtNFo,5,Freshly baked. DELICIOUSSSS!!!!! - and fast too.
ChIJpyfChlsoQg0RL0g1BIQtNFo,4,"A taste of Malaga ‚Äòs camperos. They felt slightly pricey, but were yummy and filling. The place is rather small, but the atmosphere is rather nice."
ChIJpyfChlsoQg0RL0g1BIQtNFo,5,"Cheap, filling sandwiches.  Lots of options.  Quick service.  What's not to like?"
ChIJpyfChlsoQg0RL0g1BIQtNFo,4,"They're good, very well priced, great options! Worth the stop"
ChIJVfoNQUIoQg0ROBB94FL0KCs,5,"It is the typical bar of a lifetime, one that is difficult to find in the area.
Lunch has been very good. It has a wide variety of tortillas and sandwiches.
The great price. I expected much more to be in Madrid and in the Chamber√≠ neighborhood.
Without a doubt, it will be the bar where I will return when I come to Madrid. I have felt at home."
ChIJVfoNQUIoQg0ROBB94FL0KCs,5,"To be open from 7, perfect service and tortillas from first thing in the morning."
ChIJVfoNQUIoQg0ROBB94FL0KCs,5,"Small place but with great quality in everything they offer, especially portions, sandwiches and some tapas. Everything is done at the moment, so it is super fresh and I found the attention very close."
ChIJVfoNQUIoQg0ROBB94FL0KCs,5,"A small neighborhood bar like the usual ones: fast, cheap and with good coffee. Where the waiter calls the regular customers by name while asking them affirmatively without mistake what each of them are going to drink.
In short: one of the usual places of which there are few left and much less in these parts.!.."
ChIJVfoNQUIoQg0ROBB94FL0KCs,5,"It is a small but very cozy bar, with good food and drinks at good prices. Without a doubt, the best thing is the attention and treatment of the waitress, Ruth. She was charming and attentive at all times. We will surely return soon"
ChIJl-2zYFwoQg0RwSoKrIjCUtA,5,Affordable multiple choice meals for people that live alone or doesn't have enough time to cook or just to eat something. Nice and kind people in front.
ChIJl-2zYFwoQg0RwSoKrIjCUtA,3,"Today I placed an order from Glovo and we were missing the salmorejo. I called to notify the store and the first thing they told me was that they will complain to Glovo. I told them that I didn't want to claim the money, that we wanted the salmorejo. After a while they brought him.

The thing doesn't end there, a friend was eating croquettes and we found a plastic ring inside one of them.

I called glovo and they refunded us the price of that menu, but it is true that we no longer ate comfortably. Although what we ate was pretty good. It's a shame about those two errors...."
ChIJl-2zYFwoQg0RwSoKrIjCUtA,5,"Totally recommended homemade food place. Our Christmas Eve dinner was spectacular. We loved the suckling lamb legs, the red cabbage and the prawn salad. Thanks to the entire El Laurel Natural team, you never disappoint."
ChIJl-2zYFwoQg0RwSoKrIjCUtA,1,8 euros for a plate of peas and two chicken wings
ChIJl-2zYFwoQg0RwSoKrIjCUtA,5,"I love the place, the food is always very delicious, the store is always very clean, and the service is very friendly. I love stews, macaroni and roast chicken. It's all homemade. A blessing for those of us who don't have time to cook. üôè"
ChIJAV-9fUIoQg0RTp2E--eB2gE,5,It is an authentic neighborhood bar with medium size bocadillos generously filled with all kinds of freshly prepared meats and calamari.
ChIJAV-9fUIoQg0RTp2E--eB2gE,5,"Good tapas, friendly owner."
ChIJAV-9fUIoQg0RTp2E--eB2gE,4,Good calamari sandwich and gazpacho.
ChIJAV-9fUIoQg0RTp2E--eB2gE,2,"Rude owner with few words. The veal nugget sandwich was presented to us as a simple steak sandwich. When we asked where the green pepper was, the man said: ‚Äúit's a separate supplement.‚Äù In other words, it's like ordering a carbonara and having it served without guanciale because the guanciale ‚Äúis considered a separate supplement.‚Äù
The joke costs ‚Ç¨5.30

A shame, because the calamari sandwich was good (‚Ç¨4.80)"
ChIJAV-9fUIoQg0RTp2E--eB2gE,2,"I have only come to this bar to have breakfast, and ""humorous"" comments have been made to me, totally sexist and out of place. Comments that would never be said to a male client, and I understand that I am not the first woman to whom inappropriate comments are said. There are always men in the bar and the atmosphere becomes tense when I enter, I receive some comment of this type and the rest of the men laugh. I don't feel comfortable and I probably won't come back. It's a shame, because the breakfast is very good. I hope they change or are more careful with their female clients and treat us with the same respect as their male clients.

If I return I hope this attitude changes."
ChIJMzV8nFsoQg0RQ8FMwyvc58M,4,Pizzas are good. And this local has good service. Every time I order either from the app or by phone they have great delivery times. Also I always pick up my order. The staff is kind!
ChIJMzV8nFsoQg0RQ8FMwyvc58M,1,Ass pizza
ChIJMzV8nFsoQg0RQ8FMwyvc58M,1,"Around an hour waiting for the food, poor quality. Not worth the wait"
ChIJMzV8nFsoQg0RQ8FMwyvc58M,1,I regretted my decision to eat from here
ChIJMzV8nFsoQg0RQ8FMwyvc58M,3,Good service but no place to sit
ChIJ00hYi1YoQg0RHOAg7Tf2nwM,5,A very nice hotel in a great location. The room was very well put together and very clean . Found there to be a very nice gym. Food and service was first class. I would fully recommend a stay in this chic hotel.
ChIJ00hYi1YoQg0RHOAg7Tf2nwM,5,Rooms are clean and spacious compared with the other hotel we stayed in Madrid. Very closed to a Metro station with access to multiple lines so very easy to get to all attractions we were interested in. Staffs were super nice and helpful. Breakfast has decent variety of hot and cold items.
ChIJ00hYi1YoQg0RHOAg7Tf2nwM,5,"A good and quality hotel, which although is not located in the center of Madrid, located a one-minute walk from a central metro station from which you can easily reach all the main places of Madrid.
The hotel staff was pleasant and kind,  the room was very spacious and clean, and the beds were very comfortable.
In addition, right next to the hotel there is a huge branch of the Carrefour supermarket, which is very convenient"
ChIJ00hYi1YoQg0RHOAg7Tf2nwM,3,"Okay hotel, spacious rooms, but service is super rude and they charge for the basic coffee in room! Every hotel has free coffee in room, maybe a bottle of water too. If this was a cheap hotel, yes I‚Äôd not expect anything, but for 300 euro per night, look for another option. There is nothing around, all main attractions are transport away. Easy access, but still for the price you can get a lot better hotel and centrally located."
ChIJ00hYi1YoQg0RHOAg7Tf2nwM,4,"Lovely hotel, beautiful rooms. The breakfast let it down. They had run out of coffee cups although they brought me one when asked. The cooked food was under cooked (sausages and bwcon) although the scrambled eggs were lovely. The coffee machine was nespresso pods which isn't environmentally friendly. All else excellent"
ChIJ-TOavokoQg0RAuVyukUe9nU,5,"We truly enjoyed our experience in this beautiful restaurant!
The food was really tasty and generous portion, great service and atmosphere. Very recommended."
ChIJ-TOavokoQg0RAuVyukUe9nU,5,"Everything from the great hospitality from ""El Tata"" to the amazingly authentic food was on point here at Las Ma√±anitas. We came to get a taste of food from back home. We got the nachos and tacos and a few beers. Sorry forgot to take a picture of the nachos but the nachos margaritas was great! üòÉ thanks again Tata for the hospitality!"
ChIJ-TOavokoQg0RAuVyukUe9nU,5,Such a good place to spent some time with your friends
ChIJ-TOavokoQg0RAuVyukUe9nU,3,"Very tasty enchiladas, coffee as well and worth the men√∫ del d√≠a price.

Portions could be a bit bigger, kind of like a tasting sample with less than 3 spoons of rice/beans each though..
Crema black bean soup was greatüëå"
ChIJ-TOavokoQg0RAuVyukUe9nU,5,"Amazing ambience, authentic food, lovely vibes!! Went with my friends and had a blastü•∞ wonderful experience with all the servers - made an amazingly unique experienceüíû Definitely coming again!!! Top 3 recommendations to people that come to Madrid!!!"
ChIJK6ICL1goQg0RtD08Xft-SZQ,5,"Great experience. The Coconut curry was AMAZING and the alb√≥ndigas were great. The description said there was jackfruit so I was expecting my texture but it smooth. It was still enjoyable though. I also got the pineapple tart which was good. I will DEFINITELY be back there.

Oh and I think there is free wifi."
ChIJK6ICL1goQg0RtD08Xft-SZQ,5,"Went for dinner with family and all of us loved the food. We ordered pad Thai, risotto and falafel. All of them were good. Food being made of good ingredients is a bonus. It is a no frills place you can visit often."
ChIJK6ICL1goQg0RtD08Xft-SZQ,5,"Very very good place for vegetarians that enjoy eco styles, the amazing customer care will always call you back for another time of dining in, without doubt, best vegetarian place in Madrid"
ChIJK6ICL1goQg0RtD08Xft-SZQ,5,"Restaurant is great- fully veggie with vegan options. (Review by English traveller who speaks very little Spanish): Lovely, helpful and friendly staff, great food. Buffet upstairs, veggie supermarket next door. Everything the travelling vegetarian or vegan needs. Love it!"
ChIJK6ICL1goQg0RtD08Xft-SZQ,5,"A haven for vegetarians & vegans. While relatively basic, all options are vegetarians/vegans and tasty.
All day buffet, and lunch+dinner hours with a la carte dishes also.
The staff is very friendly, patient and helpful.
Also - an opportunity to see a non-touristic part of Madrid."
ChIJvYVt3lcoQg0RS9Xc-gp-9Rg,5,"La Gran Tasca in Madrid offers an authentic culinary experience that immerses diners in the heart of Spanish gastronomy. Situated in the vibrant streets of Madrid, this restaurant captures the essence of Spanish culture through its warm ambiance and flavorful dishes. During my visit with friends, we enjoyed indulging in their renowned Madrid stew, a traditional stew epitomizing comfort food.

The ambiance of La Gran Tasca exudes a welcoming charm. Its rustic decor and cozy seating arrangement provide the perfect setting for a delightful dining experience. The attentive staff further enhanced our visit, offering friendly service and expert recommendations on the menu.

As we sampled the Madrid stew, it became evident why it is a beloved classic in Spanish cuisine. The dish was a harmonious medley of flavors and textures, with tender meats, hearty chickpeas, and an assortment of perfectly cooked vegetables. Each spoonful was a journey through Madrid's rich culinary heritage, leaving a lasting impression on our taste buds.

Beyond the Madrid stew, La Gran Tasca boasts a diverse menu featuring an array of traditional Spanish dishes, ensuring there is something to please every palate. From tapas to paella, each dish is crafted with care, using fresh ingredients that showcase the quality and authenticity of Spanish cooking.

Overall, our experience at La Gran Tasca was nothing short of exceptional. Every aspect surpassed our expectations, from the inviting ambiance to the exquisite flavors of the Madrid cocido. Whether you're a resident or a visitor to Madrid, a meal at La Gran Tasca promises a memorable culinary journey through the heart of Spanish cuisine."
ChIJvYVt3lcoQg0RS9Xc-gp-9Rg,5,"Best Cocido in town. Food and wine are great. The portion is huge though, so it is alright if you will be able to finish."
ChIJvYVt3lcoQg0RS9Xc-gp-9Rg,4,The stew was great but there's no way one person can finish it. Services were also on point.
ChIJvYVt3lcoQg0RS9Xc-gp-9Rg,5,"What an amazing place, my girlfriend's family has been going to this Restaurant for over 20 years and it never fails, great friendly atmosphere and amazing food."
ChIJvYVt3lcoQg0RS9Xc-gp-9Rg,3,"Love the restaurant but no me gusta madrile√±o ;((
Brought most of plate from home"
ChIJXxYUbV8oQg0R0MjLFXEiVo8,5,The staff is very friendly and the drinks are affordable! I paid 15 euros for 2 large beers and a Chicken diner. The Food is simple but good! Perfect place to relax after walking all day in Madrid!
ChIJXxYUbV8oQg0R0MjLFXEiVo8,5,Great atmosphere ! Very good service ! Super friendly !
ChIJXxYUbV8oQg0R0MjLFXEiVo8,4,"Nice place to have drinks with friends

ChIJSRYTH1goQg0RY4hRPbdglBc,5,"In the middle of Bravo Murillo Street, 54, we find a small place, called FLOR DE PRIMAVERA, one of the few restaurants located in the CUATRO CAMINOS neighborhood. We are greeted by a simply decorated establishment, with tables dressed in black and red tablecloths, which combine with the black of the floor tiles and the mid-height walls. The walls are white along with the ceiling. Right at the entrance, we find multicolored pots with plants that court our entrance to the small room, at the far right of which, in the background, we see the bar. The atmosphere is calm and welcoming, and with this simple welcome we are treated by the manager.
To start we have ordered the unavoidable RICE A THOUSAND DELIGHTS: a proposal with BEEF, PRAWNS, YORK HAM, EGG, CARROT AND CORN. The rice was really well seasoned, with its thick soy sauce and glutamate. This detail serves as an excellent base to support the rest of the recipe. It is one of the few places where we have tried rice so balanced in its ingredients with an intense mix of flavors.
We continue with a PRAWN SCHOPSUEY, another excellent proposal based on CARROT, ONION, SOY SPROUTS, PEPPER, PRAWNS, MUSHROOMS and ZUCCHINI. The recipe is very well prepared, the flavors and textures are just right. It is a pleasant surprise to find a Chinese restaurant with a modest location that serves such well-made recipes. As for customer service, everything has been in order: brevity and cordial treatment from its owners. We will return without a doubt."
ChIJSRYTH1goQg0RY4hRPbdglBc,1,"I have ordered through Glovo and it has been the worst. Food with liters and liters of oil. Salmon Temaki, with lettuce, mayonnaise and ketchup. Never ever."
ChIJSRYTH1goQg0RY4hRPbdglBc,5,"Delicious Chinese restaurant, they always adapt our dishes to make them vegetarian without any problem. They are friendly and the prices are very good.
The last few times we tried the three delicacies rice, the ku-bak and the hot and sour soup.
Everything is very rich."
ChIJSRYTH1goQg0RY4hRPbdglBc,5,"Excellent restaurant. Good food, fabulous and careful presentation. And a spectacular jasmine tea"
ChIJSRYTH1goQg0RY4hRPbdglBc,4,"It is a fairly old restaurant in the neighborhood.
Good food at a very reasonable price."
ChIJV_mVrvUoQg0RLy25sUi4wK8,5,"Excellent food, great vibe, lovely hostess! Came here twice. We ""wish we had a place like this in NY"""
ChIJV_mVrvUoQg0RLy25sUi4wK8,4,"Fine kosher food for everyone who cares about. Portions are very big, mostly prepared as bbq ""al ha esh"""
ChIJV_mVrvUoQg0RLy25sUi4wK8,5,"It's kosher meat restaurant, serving  flavorful antipasti salad, cus cus, kefta, lamb chops, and a steak. Portion size is impressive! Delicious French Cabernet Sauvignon was a ""cherry on top"". (They also offered ""faux gras"")"
ChIJV_mVrvUoQg0RLy25sUi4wK8,1,"We has 730 reservations. Switched to 1030 which they confirmed. Arrived at 1033 after walking 30 minutes and flying halfway across the globe to find out from a guy outside ""three guys just locked up five minutes ago"". No call or text asking or telling us. (they had our info). My guess it was a light night because it's the 9 days so they wanted to leave early (online says 1130). All we wanted was pizza and sure enough rimon pizza was literally around the corner and open. Everything worked out!"
ChIJV_mVrvUoQg0RLy25sUi4wK8,5,Good and delicious food. Small and kosher restaurant. Nice and kind service.
ChIJMY2QzlcoQg0R5gKluvu74-Q,5,"This was one of my best meals in Madrid and also my best dish during the 5 day stay here.

The sardines were great but the baby squid was exquisite a well deserved 10/10 surely. Sometimes the simplicity of food is what makes dinning such a great experience.

The staff were nice and the service was really good! A really home what seems to be a family run restaurant a wonderful lady was making the food and the everything was full of flavour!

Definetly recommend a visit if you are in Madrid and worth the short trip from the city centre."
ChIJMY2QzlcoQg0R5gKluvu74-Q,5,"Located in the Chamber√≠ district of Madrid is San Mam√©s. This bad boy has been open since 1913 and it is a neighborhood spot. As with most places in Madrid good luck parking lol.

We walk in and get hit with another Madrid staple, do you have a resi? We did not but luckily they were able to accommodate us. This place at most sits 25 people and you‚Äôre literally shoulder to shoulder.

Anyways we get sat and get brought a little chorizo tapa and receive premium service. They did tell us you need to leave by 3 but please drink all the wine haha

Chorizo Tapa 7.5/10 - would be more but it was only one bite and one for each of us lol

Callos 8.8/10 - holy shit was this immaculate. This is basically Spanish menudo. Unlike that unholy concoction, this was amazing. My god. The meat disintegrates in your mouth and is PACKED with the flavor from the broth.

Solomillo con Patatas Fritas 9/10 - holy shit was this maybe the best beef I‚Äôve ever had. A vegetarian would say it was great.

This was an Anthony Bourdain spot as well and I can see why. Another place bae and I were able to share a meal where he ate. What a delight!

Follow me on IG Eats_By_Puig"
ChIJMY2QzlcoQg0R5gKluvu74-Q,5,"I saw this restaurant on a list of recommended restaurants somewhere online. I can't even remember where. I made a reservation online and I chose this to be where we'd go our first night and Madrid which also happened to be my gf's birthday. In hindsight is it a bit pricey like someone else said? Yes. HOWEVER, OH MY GOD THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS.

I had the callos and mind you that I'm from the southern United States. Having pork/beef intestines and stomach is nothing new for me. Yet, the lack of gaminess was crazy, I even sopped up the juices. My gf had the dados de solomillos and it had to be one of the best things I'd ever tasted.

The ambiance was incredible, great lighting, great location, they brought a candle out and I felt like he went the extra mile because I told him it was my girlfriend's birthday. If you're reading this and you're on the fence. Don't think about it, GO!!!"
ChIJMY2QzlcoQg0R5gKluvu74-Q,5,"Come and eat traditional Spanish food.  Not a cheap place but well worth the price.
I am not going to give you a description of the food or of what I ate.  Suffice to tell you it is worth the trip here. Look at the menu before coming.
Just remember, for my Fellow American, like every place in Europe, this place has it‚Äôs own pace. Don‚Äôt expect fast service or you typically American waiter.  Food comes when it is ready not when you want it. Believe me, worth the wait. Pedro was really friendly.
Have the house wine. You can‚Äôt go wrong.
Drink and be happy"
ChIJMY2QzlcoQg0R5gKluvu74-Q,5,I was taken to this place by members of my wife‚Äôs family who very kindly treated us - so I‚Äôm unable to comment on the price. Fantastic authentic Spanish food (by which I mean do not expect photos of the food on the menu). Friendly and efficient service. Another reviewer has mentioned about how surprisingly good the chick peas are - and that was my experience too. We were a group of eight and everybody shared dishes in what seems like a very normal Spanish way and it was all great.  I‚Äôm definitely coming back.
ChIJ05oT5F8oQg0R6YuxEBNHL1Y,1,The club sandwich was cold and a lot of things on the menu was not available.
ChIJ05oT5F8oQg0R6YuxEBNHL1Y,5,"I really like this VIPs. It's specious and when needed you can find the perfect seating spot.
The customer service is really outstanding, so professional and always smiling."
ChIJ05oT5F8oQg0R6YuxEBNHL1Y,4,"The waiter who welcomed us was very nice and cheerful, we love everything we ordered.  we will be back!"
ChIJ05oT5F8oQg0R6YuxEBNHL1Y,4,Friendly service. Tasty VIPS food.
ChIJ05oT5F8oQg0R6YuxEBNHL1Y,3,"The atmosphere is chill but very noisy. I think my servers were a bit confused about who was going to serve me and no neither of them can by the table for a while. Both of them were friendly however. I went inside because I saw a photo of the cachopower sandwich when passing by. I realized it was spicy and asked for it not to be. The sandwich was so so. Maybe the spice would've given it more flavor. And it was drenched in mayo, I had to wipe a lot off. My oreo shake didn't taste like oreo even though I could see all the ores bits. It was pretty thin and tasted like sweetness. I'd consider returning to try something else on the menu."
ChIJFeQMN1YoQg0RJodCd2J_BEo,5,"One of my fav places in Madrid along the years, they offer fresh seafood combined with fine meat and a nice wine menu. The staff is attentive and friendly, the store has evolved over the years in a positive manner but keeping what makes them unique. I recommend: almejas a la marinera & of course carabineers.
Desserts are also home made
5 stars"
ChIJFeQMN1YoQg0RJodCd2J_BEo,4,"Very good seafood, super tasty. Service could be better. Nice fresh-water spray outside, essential by summer time."
ChIJFeQMN1YoQg0RJodCd2J_BEo,5,"The crab was amazing
The stuff was wonderful. The food came in hot and there was big quantities"
ChIJFeQMN1YoQg0RJodCd2J_BEo,2,"Not fresh seafood , prawns soggy and definitely past their eatable date. Tourist special. Fish was good but not great. Hard time getting the bill waited 40mins. Atmosphere below average next to busy underground carpark lots of honking horns and near car accidents. Give this place a miss"
ChIJFeQMN1YoQg0RJodCd2J_BEo,5,"I have been eating at NorteSur for about 15 years now, and it never disappoints. It's a bit pricey, but the quality of the seafood is second to none. The best clams you will find anywhere, the massive crabs are amazing, and the steak is also excellent. Really everything on the menu is great. The place to go in Madrid if you want the highest quality seafood."
ChIJa5e8D_koQg0RMZJyKnHMGE4,4,"We were two at the time of our visit. Ordered several dishes to share.
An amuse bouche was served before the dishes. We shared an idiazabal cheese fritter, duck and pork terrine with orange compote, sweetbread and cold veal tripe with pumpkin seeds.
The cheese fritter was okay but nothing special.
Pork terrine was delicious but the duck one wasn't at the same level.
The sweetbreads were good, but to my liking it could have been crispier on the outside.
Cold veal tripe was my most favourite dish, I really liked how they prepared it.
Overall a decent restaurant with a modern atmosphere."
ChIJa5e8D_koQg0RMZJyKnHMGE4,5,"Came to celebrate my birthday. Everything put in my mouth was tasty. The server was friendly.

Cheese fritters: cheesy, soft, like a little cheese bomb blowed in my mouth, very flavorful.

Duck terrine: got a clean taste, perfect with bread and orange jam.

Ensalada de corujas: the best salad I ever had, super refreshing. I loved the salad dressing so much that I used bread to dip every last drop.

Seabass in curry sauce: I got different opinions on this dish. My friend said the sauce is overpowering, while I think it‚Äôs fine. The curry flavor reminded me of the curry sausage I had in Germany.

Courgette flower: another amazing fried dish.

Beetroot with mascarpone:  a little dessert like. Beet and mascarpone are my two favorite things so I died for this combination.

Main dishes were ok, not as impressive as the appetizers.

Flan was amazing, perfectly done. Also love the cute birthday meringue plate they did!"
ChIJa5e8D_koQg0RMZJyKnHMGE4,5,"The food here is surprisingly fantastic and quite eye opening given that we have spent almost 10 days here in Spain. The artichoke, lamb and sangrias were amazing as they were flavorful and delicious. Although we (4 persons) shared the dishes, we left the restaurant satisfied and full as the portions weren‚Äôt too small.

The dessert is highly complexed in flavors as it‚Äôs vanilla based but goes deeper behind that. Really worth the try."
ChIJa5e8D_koQg0RMZJyKnHMGE4,5,"Great culinary experience in such a cozy restaurant! Food is great, everything you choose is a good option, so I‚Äôd suggest taking half portions in order to try more dishes. Then, the staff who is also very friendly and attentive, so that‚Äôs a big plus. Will go again for sure!"
ChIJa5e8D_koQg0RMZJyKnHMGE4,4,"Outstanding service and matching price. Good to order half size dishes! I like the infusion style food but I would expect the taste even better, but it is the atmosphere we enjoy right?"
ChIJu3xEz1coQg0RS3NO9mx3_YA,5,Great place to eat excellent Asturian food. Very good pricing and fast service. Check the menu online for details.
ChIJu3xEz1coQg0RS3NO9mx3_YA,5,"I like this place. I was there for dinner with family. We had the things people recommended on Google.
Great was the lomo alto.
And the cachopo de was tasty too.
We didn't reserve and got our table right away, because it is summer ( end July) normally u need to reserve"
ChIJu3xEz1coQg0RS3NO9mx3_YA,5,Top spot
ChIJu3xEz1coQg0RS3NO9mx3_YA,5,It‚Äôs a nice place for asturian food. Went there with my family and loved the atmosphere. Really cozy and the staff is super friendly.
ChIJu3xEz1coQg0RS3NO9mx3_YA,5,"A much reduced menu from the pandemic but I'm still obsessed with their fried camembert salad. Tuna tartar, shrimp, the patatas, many good things on this menu. Good value for what you get."
ChIJ_4f8GFwoQg0R-iiG8u5KlJo,5,"We had a wonderful meal and the service was very good. The salad of tuna, tomatoes, onion and pepper was particularly special with delicious bonito del Norte tuna."
ChIJ_4f8GFwoQg0R-iiG8u5KlJo,5,"Typical Spanish bar/restaurant. Orange juice so delicious, good coffee cortado, certainly good tortilla de patata. Perfect to start the day."
ChIJ_4f8GFwoQg0R-iiG8u5KlJo,2,"Stopped here for drinks and a bite to eat. Service was quick to come and take our order and they helped by bringing out a menu in English. My wife ordered an orange juice which arrived with a seed floating in it, I appreciate it was freshly squeezed but it would have taken seconds to fish it out and made it much more presentable. She also had some chunks of bone in the burger she ordered. We may have just been unlucky but with plenty of places around to eat, first impressions are important."
ChIJ_4f8GFwoQg0R-iiG8u5KlJo,5,"This cafe was so great! They were open all day and late into the evening. We had a wonderful coffee and breakfast there and then stopped back at night.... We went all over the city for tapas. However, this was by far the best place for tapas! Every time we ordered another beer the owner would bring us a new and different tapa for two! He was very friendly even though our spanish was limited. He fed us so well, we eventually had to ask him to stop bringing us tapas. I highly recommend sitting outside and enjoying a beverage and tapas at this place! It was the perfect way to end the day and try different spanish cuisine!"
ChIJ_4f8GFwoQg0R-iiG8u5KlJo,1,"I don‚Äôt know why people would stop here-a 2,80‚Ç¨ ca√±a is beyond price gouging. Even worse, a doble of ESTRELLA (not even Galicia) is 4‚Ç¨. HORRIBLE. The staff weren‚Äôt even kind either. This is a dive bar with barrio Salamanca prices. Paso."
ChIJkT0VYV4oQg0RqrHQQ2kr56w,5,Really a nice pizza. One of the best prosciutto e funghi pizza in town. Great delivery too
ChIJkT0VYV4oQg0RqrHQQ2kr56w,1,"Food was mediocre for the price. 15‚Ç¨ not so bad for 2 people, but the reviews made it seem better. Food came a lot later due to us putting in the wrong address- just a few streets down. We received an email, luckily we checked it, stating the delivery was here and it was urgent to reply due to the deliverer not being able to contact us. The phone number was correct in the info, not to mention Just Eat was calling just fine. The driver shows up and immediately starts speaking as if he's annoyed, which is understandable, but to keep talking and talking and obviously be upset is unnecessary. I'm English speaking and the driver was Spanish speaking, I apologized how I knew to. He just kept showing me the receipt with the wrong address. I tipped him 4‚Ç¨ Because I felt bad for putting in the address wrong, when I should have kept it due to his rude attitude. Communication barrier was hard to relay for feeling bad for his time wasted, but still uncalled for. Wouldn't eat here again though."
ChIJkT0VYV4oQg0RqrHQQ2kr56w,5,"very delicious, by her hands üòä"
ChIJkT0VYV4oQg0RqrHQQ2kr56w,5,Really good
ChIJkT0VYV4oQg0RqrHQQ2kr56w,5,"I placed an order through just eat and by mistake I marked the in-store pickup option.
I contacted them and they very kindly helped me solve it and manage the shipping.
The pizza arrived perfect and the dough was delicious and crispy.

I totally recommend it!
Thank you very much, I will repeat!"
ChIJNe0K0lsoQg0RCmQmQJU2rL8,5,This place was near to where we were staying. A little pricey but not too bad considering its open all hours. Great for getting any forgotten essentials.
ChIJNe0K0lsoQg0RCmQmQJU2rL8,5,"Wide variety of products, from snacks to basic necessities. The staff is very friendly and the service is fast. üëç"
ChIJNe0K0lsoQg0RCmQmQJU2rL8,2,"If you have no other choice to get out of trouble...
Very fair indeed
A little kindness and sympathy from the clerk wouldn't hurt.
Expensive, very expensive.
A loaf of low-quality bread for almost 80 cents is outrageous.
A colder and stiffer pasty than the ones that cost almost ‚Ç¨3 is an armed robbery.
It's not worth it."
ChIJNe0K0lsoQg0RCmQmQJU2rL8,1,"The other day I went shopping at a place I usually go to for dinner because I work the night shift and we don't have access to personal hygiene at work, so we depend on establishments like that. On this occasion, I asked the manager if it was possible to use the bathroom, and he replied that they didn't have one. However, shortly afterward some Venezuelans, who seemed to be his acquaintances, came in and told him they were going to use the bathroom. He answered yes, which left me shocked and quite uncomfortable. For that reason, I decided that I will not return to that place again."
ChIJNe0K0lsoQg0RCmQmQJU2rL8,5,"Excellent service from the guys, √Ångel is a crack. Everything is found"
ChIJi0x5BFwoQg0RLv9wFoCDvMo,5,"Best restaurant experience in a long time. For once, all the positive reviews are true! Funny enough I'm in town for a conference on gastronomy,  As a professional food researcher, this is what we all look for: Fresh, local food made with care. Nothing industrial about this place, and no short cuts. Honest food from start to finish, with no silly decoration to make it instagramable. And the informal and friendly service makes it even better.  Don't miss out, this is the local place you were looking for!"
ChIJi0x5BFwoQg0RLv9wFoCDvMo,5,"He doesn't have a menu, cooks daily, and everything is great and fresh; it is hardly recommended! In addition to the careful service, he speaks pretty good English!"
ChIJi0x5BFwoQg0RLv9wFoCDvMo,5,"Amazing food!!! So fresh ! We had the smoked sardines, octopus and ham coquette for starters. Our mains were chicken, salted cod stew and tripe stew. Every single dish showcased the attention n love that the chef Pepote puts into each dish. Definitely worth the trip here. N chef Pepote was super nice n attentive! Lovely dinner !"
ChIJi0x5BFwoQg0RLv9wFoCDvMo,5,"A little jewel in Chamber√≠. A small place with 7 tables. Only 6 dishes inclusive of starters and main courses for dinner.  Outstanding food, carefully explained before ordering. Reasonable prices. Wonderful team of owner (of 14 years, we asked) in the kitchen and waiter on the floor. Attentive, friendly service. Great for a quiet evening with excellent food and feel-at-home service! Well done guys."
ChIJi0x5BFwoQg0RLv9wFoCDvMo,5,"It was an exceptional dining experience where we felt truly at home. The owner and Chef created an incredibly warm atmosphere and treated us with genuine kindness and care. Their attention to detail in both service and cuisine was remarkable. Each dish was prepared with passion, showcasing their commitment to serving outstanding food. We were so impressed that we're already planning our next visit. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a memorable meal in a neighborhood gem and welcoming environment!"
ChIJYycky1soQg0Rft5tzUXi9ok,1,"Can there be more misery? They never fill my bowl with lentils. When I asked them to add a little more, they told me that that is the amount and that is how it stays ////In 4-ingredient salads you cannot choose the same ingredient twice. I don't see the logic when you're paying for 4 ingredients. One of the waitresses explains to me that it's because people order 4 chicken ingredients and they run out of chicken. The solution, gentlemen, is to buy more chicken. Next, another waitress tells me that if I pay for an extra ingredient, she can add more chicken. What are we left with? Are you kidding?"
ChIJYycky1soQg0Rft5tzUXi9ok,5,"I eat here twice a week and the quality-price ratio is unbeatable by ordering the half salad and lentil/vegetable cream menu. If you order juices or desserts it becomes more expensive.
The quality of the products is fine. The lentils and creams are homemade and are very good.
You can also order it by WhatsApp and pick it up when you leave the gym."
ChIJYycky1soQg0Rft5tzUXi9ok,2,"The staff is quite rude. The food is good, yes, but of the 4 times I have gone and ordered salad, in 3 of them they did not have chicken and in 1 they did not have eggs and it seems like something basic for a gym restaurant and easy to purchase. Furthermore, they don't let you repeat ingredients even if they are missing ingredients and you have to either ask for less ingredients or ask for things you don't want. Well man, if you are missing an ingredient as basic as chicken, what less than letting the ingredient repeat itself."
ChIJYycky1soQg0Rft5tzUXi9ok,1,"The attention of the waitress in the morning... makes you wait and talks inside. Zero kindness. There is no quality and almost nothing is healthy, except the pancakes but since he is lazy he usually tells you that it will take a long time."
ChIJYycky1soQg0Rft5tzUXi9ok,1,"It is a real shame at the Soto de la Moraleja location, there are fewer and fewer ingredients, basic ingredients are missing every day, the salads are getting smaller and smaller. Yesterday they gave me exactly 6 pieces of chicken, if together the crab they gave me was no more than half a stick and the same thing happens with the combined dishes, the other day white rice with minced meat and for more than 8 euros it was two tablespoons of rice . I have had to call their attention several times because they use the same cutlery for everything including nuts, any day they have a problem with allergy sufferers."
ChIJAZZnIlwoQg0R6Z2p_EujOXU,5,"This place is something else! I recommend going here during the vermouth o‚Äôclock on Sunday - yes, perhaps you‚Äôll have to stand squeezed between a group of neighbours and chess players, but nothing screams ‚Äúthe vibe‚Äù as much as this.
The selection of vermouths is fantastic, and they provide the scale from sweet to dry, so you can choose according to your preferences (or just try them all)! Also, should I even mention that the interior is ultimately cool?"
ChIJAZZnIlwoQg0R6Z2p_EujOXU,5,"Great selection of Vermouths. Beer, wines and spirits are also served here, but vermouth is the reason to be here. Highly recommend!"
ChIJAZZnIlwoQg0R6Z2p_EujOXU,5,Great vermouth selection with lovely pickled items served with each glass. Great outdoor seating and warm service. Highly recommend!
ChIJAZZnIlwoQg0R6Z2p_EujOXU,5,Excellent bar to have a semi guided tour of different vermouths at a reasonable price. The bartenders know their product and make good recommendations. The free tapas are above average.
ChIJAZZnIlwoQg0R6Z2p_EujOXU,5,Great local spot for vermouth and some tapas. One of our favorite vermouth place in Madrid.
ChIJI8RQrl0oQg0R7JmINsj2yUg,5,"I stumbled across this place on google maps based on a food craving I was having and that it was near where I was staying. There‚Äôs quite a good amont of options ranging from full meals with meat, fries, and a drink, all the way to little snack bites such as nuggets, palitos de mozzarella and more. I also liked that the menu was on the outside, on the wall next to the allergies and certificates and on the farther side near the grill.

When I arrived it wasn‚Äôt super busy but because the restaurant was so small, just 5-6 people in the restaurant at the same time made things seem cluttered and full. Despite being a small restaurant the kitchen area is still organized and clean. There was also only one person working so it did take a bit longer but it was definitely worth the wait.

The food was absolutely delicious especially the ‚ÄòDurum Arroz‚Äô. I had gotten ‚ÄòDurum Arroz‚Äô and ‚ÄòDurum Patatas‚Äô to go. The to go bag was also really nice because it had a little strap. I‚Äôd recommend as well to get your food to go mainly because the restaurant isn‚Äôt a big place and there‚Äôs only 1 table and 2 seats. Unless you don‚Äôt mind eating while walking."
ChIJI8RQrl0oQg0R7JmINsj2yUg,5,"Great kebab, great price, friendly owner, couldn't ask for more :)"
ChIJI8RQrl0oQg0R7JmINsj2yUg,5,Very tasty and cheap kebab ! Worth it Time spent
ChIJI8RQrl0oQg0R7JmINsj2yUg,5,"One of the good kebabs in the town.
Good service."
ChIJI8RQrl0oQg0R7JmINsj2yUg,5,This might be the best kebab I‚Äôve ever eaten! Store‚Äôs really small but the flavor makes up for it.
ChIJGfsKYFkoQg0RkN2Zd-ksIQg,5,"This restaurant in the Vallehermoso Market in Madrid is a gem!  A fusion of Peruvian and Asian influences the food is great!  It‚Äôs understandably popular so reservations need to be made one month in advance.
The service was efficient and friendly.
Every dish of the fixed tasting menu was not only delicious but also beautifully presented.
The market is a full of character but is a touch rough and tumble, but in my opinion, the location adds to the overall experience."
ChIJGfsKYFkoQg0RkN2Zd-ksIQg,5,Asian-Peruvian ‚ÄúMercado Food‚Äù with a delicious 8 dish tasting menu.
ChIJGfsKYFkoQg0RkN2Zd-ksIQg,5,"We had a great first experience at tropea tonight. Our server, Julian was attentive and explained the menu clearly while adding subs for dietary requirements without any hesitation. Recommendations were very welcome and they seemed genuinely open to feedback on the food rather than just the usual cursory question halfway through the meal. The prawn linguini and octopus were our favourites."
ChIJGfsKYFkoQg0RkN2Zd-ksIQg,5,"WOW! What a delicious meal!!
I went there with a friend for the lunch service. We're both foodies and the experience at Tripea is one of the best ones we've had at Madrid!
The restaurant is situated inside a market, where you'll find a long table all the guests sit around. The concept is a service of 8 Peruvian-Asian dishes, including a dessert. The courses are being served for everyone at the same time.
Every single course was carefully made, beautifully presented, and packed full of lovely flavours! My personal favorite was the BAO bun that comes up somewhere in the middle of the meal.
Our server was kind and attentive, and explained about each course.
Highly recommend!!"
ChIJGfsKYFkoQg0RkN2Zd-ksIQg,5,"Was pleasantly surprised by the combination of flavours the Chef put together. Being Asian, I appreciated how different his take was on the Asian flavours of my childhood. Most of the dishes had a tart / tangy flavour profile, which I loved. I felt there was one miss: the iberico siew mai, which was one dimensional in flavour ‚Äî much too sweet. The star of the show was the tuna belly tartare with coconut cream and chives ‚Äî the balance of flavours and textures was truly spectacular. It wasn't included in the tasting menu, though, and came at an additional cost. Service was excellent, pacing of the dishes was good, and overall, it was fantastic quality and quantity for the price. Very happy I managed to score a last minute reservation, and will definitely be back if I am ever in Spain again."
ChIJjRYUbV8oQg0Rkvmowxj-9Q8,5,"Don‚Äôt go in expecting a Michelin star, but if you‚Äôre up for a fun concept and you‚Äôre not too picky about your plate ‚Äî this place delivers! The food is simple, the atmosphere is great, and the prices make it totally worth it. Perfect spot if you‚Äôre hungry and want to save some cash."
ChIJjRYUbV8oQg0Rkvmowxj-9Q8,5,"Great found! Very affordable food that allows you to get as much as different taste of Madrid. Youthful atmosphere, a must go place!"
ChIJjRYUbV8oQg0Rkvmowxj-9Q8,3,"The prices are one of the most affordable in central Madrid. You can truly have a couple of beers and decent sized tapas for less than 10 euros. Sounds amazing, right? But everything has a cost, and for Tapeando is low quality food (fried stuff, lots of rice and etc), and low quality beer (amstel, which is inferior to the standard Mahou that 90% of the bars in Madrid serve). Also, because of the prices the ambient is crowded and noisy. Excellent if you are on a budget, but skip it if you have a few extra bucks on your pocket."
ChIJjRYUbV8oQg0Rkvmowxj-9Q8,5,One of the best services I've got in Madrid and really economic prices. Highly recommendable if you want to grab a beer or a drink with your friends.
ChIJjRYUbV8oQg0Rkvmowxj-9Q8,5,This small bar is open till late most days. Good atmosphere and fast service. I recommend it.
ChIJxykr5fAoQg0RT7s0VYsD6gE,5,"This little Italian restaurant was surprisingly good. One of the best amatriciana I‚Äôve had. It is a very busy and small restaurant over lunch and the staff did their best to accommodate us inside rather then in the cold. Set lunch comes with a starter, main and coffee or dessert. Try it out!! üòçüòçüòç"
ChIJxykr5fAoQg0RT7s0VYsD6gE,5,ornella & gaetano are the best servers ever. I HIGHLY recommend the family style meal and the drinks are awesome. We had vegetarians and nut allergies at our table and they were super accommodating.
ChIJxykr5fAoQg0RT7s0VYsD6gE,5,"MOST INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE, we had nut allergy and vegetarians and the servers ornella and gaetano ARE THE BEST. Go here (especially on wednesdays because they have the best two drink deal!!)"
ChIJxykr5fAoQg0RT7s0VYsD6gE,3,"Bad service and overpriced. Not even saying good morning or thanks or whatever.
Apparently a classy place. I ordered a latte and a croissant : overcooked and they didnt bring cutlery to eat it. Take away on a table."
ChIJxykr5fAoQg0RT7s0VYsD6gE,5,"This could be the best Italian meal I have ever had! We have been traveling for an extended amount of time and discovered this lovely restaurant today. I can go on and on about everything  I loved about this place but, it should cover it all when I say ‚Äúhands down, no doubt the best meal I have had while traveling through Spain.‚Äù I hated the meal to end. The service and staff/management was outstanding. I have one more day in Madrid and just might have to go back again tomorrow!!"
ChIJ7csHvvEoQg0RtmkxMevCMaw,4,"Great ambience, good food and service. We enjoyed a live show with trumpet and piano. Desserts reccomended"
ChIJ7csHvvEoQg0RtmkxMevCMaw,5,"Absolutely fantastic place! Delicious food, friendly stuff and nice music!"
ChIJ7csHvvEoQg0RtmkxMevCMaw,3,"I would rate this a 3-stars for BRUNCH
4 stars for atmosphere & service.
The service was kind and attentive, the menu has some good choices, however a few items needed some help: for instance- If you will offer North American type of breakfast/brunch options-  like pancakes ü•û. Please take the time to research a recipe.  Pancakes are supposed to be light and fluffy. The chemistry between a bit of salt and baking soda fluffs up and creates a slight, crisp texture on the outside and fluffy inside- similar to porras- but flat and round.  And please don‚Äôt place eggs Benedict on your menu if you don‚Äôt know how to make a proper poached egg or hollandaise sauce: otherwise it is NOT ‚Äúeggs benedict.‚Äù  This is not a BOSCO problem as i find most restaurants do the same.

Otherwise, i find the space very open, well lit, and we all liked the design. The entertainment was also great. I hope to visit in the evening and try the dinner menu."
ChIJ7csHvvEoQg0RtmkxMevCMaw,4,"Nice place for music and drinks, small portions"
ChIJ7csHvvEoQg0RtmkxMevCMaw,5,Nice ambient and decoration. Cool people
ChIJue1CW_koQg0Ra-LSIm6fSTo,4,"Very nice place for a meat dish. High quality but higher cost than average.
Service was outstanding.
Decoration is lacking ang layout is a little funky."
ChIJue1CW_koQg0Ra-LSIm6fSTo,5,"This is real top place. Should have more then 5 stars. Food and customer service are amazing.
Very good list of wines, also list of allergens.
Best water and fresh bread.
Outstanding quality of food.
I love it."
ChIJue1CW_koQg0Ra-LSIm6fSTo,5,"A thoughtful restoration and lots of creativity transformed this restaurant into a traditional space with an oddly modern feel. Although it‚Äôs worth trying out the bar snacks like the Txangurro (which I consider the best one in Madrid), its restaurant is a unique experience to enjoy one of the best Spanish traditional cuisine."
ChIJue1CW_koQg0Ra-LSIm6fSTo,4,"Very good service, nice food, a bit expensive for my taste. The croquetas de espinacas were delicious, the stake tartar mmm not that good, everything else ok. I love that we had a private space for our group, we were around 10."
ChIJue1CW_koQg0Ra-LSIm6fSTo,5,Amazing Spanish food! Excellent service and everything was delicious.
ChIJ6amvw_AoQg0RsNPHWdckuDM,3,"I visited the restaurant based on a certain online review, but it was very disappointing. The food was just okay. We tried quite a few items, but the basic Italian dish 'Carbonara' was not perfected. The most funny part was that this restaurant ran out olive oil when asked to have along with the bread."
ChIJ6amvw_AoQg0RsNPHWdckuDM,5,"Delightful as usual. Had the special pasta plate with a surprise variety of three different flavors (both pasta and sauce). Pasta is fresh and delicious. If I had to say something to improve it might be the service which is ok but could perfectly be improved. Having said that, we're ready for the next visit to Il Pastaio!"
ChIJ6amvw_AoQg0RsNPHWdckuDM,3,"It was an ok italian restaurant! Nothing special, but it wasn‚Äôt bad! Wouldn‚Äôt go back though"
ChIJ6amvw_AoQg0RsNPHWdckuDM,5,Loved the carbonara and cheesecake! The staff was so nice.
ChIJ6amvw_AoQg0RsNPHWdckuDM,5,"Incredible homemade pasta. I can't recommend the truffle pasta enough, absolutely incredible. The non-pasta stuff is fine, but next time I'll stick to the noodles. Very kind staff as well."
ChIJo-ZRDvkoQg0Rjdo96Bn0L-E,5,The food was amazing and the servers were extremely nice and precise with the order. We were served by a girl named Jennifer she was very lovely.
ChIJo-ZRDvkoQg0Rjdo96Bn0L-E,5,"It's our first time in the restaurant, and it was an amazing experience, from the beginning until the end. We were attended by Belkys, and she did a great service, we've felt welcomed and confortable in the restaurant. When the food was served, our experience only got even better, it has been some time since I've eaten such great pasta and sauce. I higly recommend the place and any plate of the menu. Great wine selection as well."
ChIJo-ZRDvkoQg0Rjdo96Bn0L-E,5,"Delicious Italian place that is not a fancy place but straight to the point: classical dishes, fresh ingredients, and a friendly retiring service. I really liked the home made focaccia that is served for the start."
ChIJo-ZRDvkoQg0Rjdo96Bn0L-E,5,"Lovely Italian restaurant. Really good pizza, nice atmosphere. Service was provided by Andres, who was great. I recommend it and I will definitely return"
ChIJo-ZRDvkoQg0Rjdo96Bn0L-E,5,"Incredible food, like insanely good. Incredible service - thanks Jennifer!"
ChIJgco3dPkoQg0RgyYPzAaLBnM,5,"Incredible food & gluten free options! Love the space and service - had a lovely dinner with tuna tar tar, nigiri, wagyu, and more. Would definitely recommend and eat here again. We were too stuffed for dessert but the mochi was also gluten free!"
ChIJgco3dPkoQg0RgyYPzAaLBnM,4,"Small restaurant, attentive staff, we enjoyed the food. My favorite I believe was called the hatate maki. For dessert my husband and I both ordered the Rocher 99 very cute presentation. They also bring a plate of truffles to end your meal. My husband also enjoyed the vanilla mandarin tea. Helpful tip they do have an English menu if you don't read Spanish üëç"
ChIJgco3dPkoQg0RgyYPzAaLBnM,5,"This was one of, if not the best sushi I have ever had. The service was impeccable down to every last detail. The presentation of each dish by both the wait staff and chefs was exquisite. And the food, the sushi, the tartar, the dessert.. my mouth is watering simply thinking about it as I try to find the words to describe each and every texture and flavor. Simply put, there are no words that could properly do it justice. It is a must if you love sushi and Japanese cuisine. Enjoying a meal here is something you will never forget."
ChIJgco3dPkoQg0RgyYPzAaLBnM,4,"Sushi quality is very high. A bit pricey, but it's worth to try. We had Wagyu Nigiri, Shoft Shell Crab Roll, Eel Roll and Mistura Roll.
5 star service"
ChIJgco3dPkoQg0RgyYPzAaLBnM,4,Fantastic food and service!! Temperature in restaurant > 30 degrees.  Management out of touch?  Been here many times - wonderful but this is a sweat fest.
ChIJGzhvv-0oQg0RnHMleKve4ms,4,"Located in the heart of Madrid, its dishes mean that you cannot stop eating and enjoying its services and good value for money. Obviously you can return not only with your friends but also with your partner or family to enjoy everything you can find on this site. Highly recommended by me and by everyone who was there."
ChIJGzhvv-0oQg0RnHMleKve4ms,4,"One of the must-see restaurants if you are in Madrid... The best is the wine list and of course the spectacular service they have. A clean and totally avant-garde decoration. It is in a good area and the atmosphere is varied, great value for money!!! I really enjoyed a chocolate dessert that was finger-licking good. This summer they will have a great menu, try it!"
ChIJGzhvv-0oQg0RnHMleKve4ms,4,"The La Broche restaurant is very notable, especially for its exquisite wines. You can go to spend time there with your friends, parents, family and the best thing is that you can go with quite a few people. In this place, before going, you don't even need to reserve most of the time because it is a fairly large place. Highly recommended, especially for those who like to accompany their food with a good wine."
ChIJGzhvv-0oQg0RnHMleKve4ms,4,"It is one of the most incredible restaurants and it is wonderful that you have been able to go.  It has some great wines and is perfect for tasting wines since they combine them exquisitely with food. Good presence and good food. Once again it is shown that this man is a genius and that he knows what he does with what he has. The place is impressive, no detail is missing."
ChIJGzhvv-0oQg0RnHMleKve4ms,4,"From the restaurant La Broche, on Miguel Angel, 29, I have very good memories of the customer service, very attentive at all times to my needs and fast, something that I especially value. The food was quite good, although I thought the portions were very small for a price that is not enough to afford it every day. It has an excellent wine list, tasteful decoration and a premium location. Greetings."
ChIJGRKmkPAoQg0RB2fMOlDAOrM,4,"Very good cooking experience and a whole new world of new pasta cooking secrets.
Thanks, Enrica Barni!"
ChIJGRKmkPAoQg0RB2fMOlDAOrM,4,A different way of having dinner.
ChIJGRKmkPAoQg0RB2fMOlDAOrM,5,"An excellent place for courses and food tasting, a very interesting Italian proposal where you can learn a lot about Italian products and add to our daily lives.

Also highlight their store where you can buy their variety of products, without a doubt the pasta with fresh boletus and the pistachio cream the best I have ever tried."
ChIJGRKmkPAoQg0RB2fMOlDAOrM,4,"Great store - Italian food school.
Sale of authentic products; and quite peculiar and difficult to find in Spain.
In the back they have a kitchen where they do courses, teambuilding, or dinners with friends (min. 10 people) in which they teach you and you make your own dinner and then you enjoy it at the premises.
Very good attention."
ChIJGRKmkPAoQg0RB2fMOlDAOrM,5,"Incredible experience. We went there for the company dinner and the service is impeccable.
Enrica is a sweetheart and the waiter is super attentive and respectful. You make your own pasta for dinner, I loved it. ü´∂üèº"
ChIJJQ7eL_ooQg0RFdYKYsay2cI,5,"Non touristic simple bar with great food and a very pleasant lady at the bar.
The bartender lady saw us completely lost with the menu and went to help out, explained everything and recommended not to take too much food as the portions are big (and they really were).
Fajitas were just delicious! The place is not pricey at all."
ChIJJQ7eL_ooQg0RFdYKYsay2cI,5,"I don't get why it's got only 4.2. great food , drinks and a superb vibe from young people. Only locals here so I loved it as a tourist. 5 stars for sure."
ChIJJQ7eL_ooQg0RFdYKYsay2cI,5,Just went back again. This place is just great. Food is just consistently great but the smiles and staff and atmosphere is just great. Make a point of dropping in. .
ChIJJQ7eL_ooQg0RFdYKYsay2cI,5,"Great atmosphere, situated away from the busier avenue. The service is both quick and friendly, with English-speaking staff available."
ChIJJQ7eL_ooQg0RFdYKYsay2cI,5,"Wonderful restaurant. Our family of four stayed in Madrid for a month, and we visited this restaurant three times. We kept coming back for the food and the friendly staff. We felt right at home here and enjoyed all the dishes we tried. The next time we make it back to Madrid, this will be one of our first stops. Thank you, Rafaela and staff, for taking such great care of us! :)"
ChIJGdoTMvEoQg0RUjaVOGd3Gn4,5,"Small, intimate dining area with great service. Quality food. The two fish dishes and sauces we had were excellent. Food was hot. Straight from the kitchen. The servers are charming. I will return."
ChIJGdoTMvEoQg0RUjaVOGd3Gn4,5,Comida cl√°sica con creatividad. A great place to experience real Spanish food while also eating something hard to find elsewhere. A great recommendation for any non-spanish who are visiting Madrid.
ChIJGdoTMvEoQg0RUjaVOGd3Gn4,5,"Great food loved it nice place, great service and it cost us 100‚Ç¨ for four of us and a good wine.The ham was great but best of all the meat with some type of sauce.LOVED IT!!!!!"
ChIJGdoTMvEoQg0RUjaVOGd3Gn4,5,"This was a delightful gem.  Quiet, great for conversations.  Attentive service, delightful meat and fish entrees and the poached pear dessert was exquisite."
ChIJGdoTMvEoQg0RUjaVOGd3Gn4,3,"It was good, though a little tight and not add great add we were told."
ChIJcX3Coe4oQg0RDG5z5QDBgmI,5,"Zalaca√≠n ‚Äì A Culinary Gem in Madrid

Zalaca√≠n in Madrid offers a truly exceptional gastronomic experience, reflecting its well-deserved reputation and rich history. The elegant and sophisticated ambiance immediately captivates guests, while the attentive and professional service enhances the dining experience.

As a starter, we chose the prawn salad, which impressed us with its freshness and perfect balance of flavors. The prawns were cooked to perfection, and the ingredients complemented each other beautifully, resulting in a light yet flavorful dish.

For the main course, we tried the tripe, a traditional dish of Spanish cuisine. At Zalaca√≠n, this dish stood out‚Äîthe tripe was tender and flavorful, with perfectly balanced seasoning. It truly showcased the chefs‚Äô expertise and deep respect for tradition.

The restaurant‚Äôs wine list is also remarkable, offering a wide selection of high-quality wines that pair excellently with the dishes.

Overall, Zalaca√≠n is a place where traditional Spanish cuisine meets modern gastronomy in an elegant yet welcoming setting. We highly recommend it to anyone looking for an unforgettable culinary experience in Madrid."
ChIJcX3Coe4oQg0RDG5z5QDBgmI,5,"We had a fantastic experience at Zalaca√≠n in Madrid. Everything was impeccable‚Äîfrom the warm and professional service to the exceptional cuisine.
The bogavante was incredibly fresh and cooked to perfection, the steak tartare was expertly seasoned and had an amazing texture, and the oyster in champagne sauce was simply outstanding‚Äîa delicate and unforgettable combination of flavors.
The elegant atmosphere and attention to detail make this restaurant a perfect choice for a special occasion or a refined dining experience. I highly recommend Zalaca√≠n and look forward to returning soon!"
ChIJcX3Coe4oQg0RDG5z5QDBgmI,4,Beautiful restaurant and really great service. A classic in Madrid. I enjoyed the food but was not wowed by it. The star dish (not shown on the photos) is the callos - very good smoky flavour. The beef Wellington is also quite good. It is an expensive restaurant where most dishes start at 28+ euros. Starter portions are small but I do recommend sharing the wellington as it is a heavy dish.
ChIJcX3Coe4oQg0RDG5z5QDBgmI,5,Classy and classic. Worth a visit. Take the recommendations. Come early for the tasting menu.
ChIJcX3Coe4oQg0RDG5z5QDBgmI,5,"For the first Michelin star restaurant I ate at.  This place blew me away.  The complexity of the dishes and tastes were phenomenal.

If you are thinking of trying a Michelin star restaurant out please do it and you will not regret it.  Only thing you may regret is the bill at the end but I guarantee the atmosphere and flavors will make this a memorable experience.

Upon walking in you are greeted by the staff.  You see a very well lit area before walking to your table.  You will have some decor and upon sitting will be given some dishes.  These are very light but contain so much flavor.  For a starter I tried the lasagna and if your looking for a cheesy dish and has that decadent cheese flavor.  You have to try it.  On top of that was the croquettes these were so delicious.  Containing that amount of cheese that makes you instantly want to grab another.  Don't forget the endless supply of fresh bread that will hold you over just enough until your main course arrives.  I ordered the Hare and what a dish this was.  For my first time trying this I was blown away the the taste and tenderness of the dish.

Finishing the night I went with the crepes.  I figured how could a dessert item get any better.  Not only was it cooked fresh infront of me but the flavor was immense.  Fresh fruit taste and the inside was very creamy.

Finally, for the review I would have to give this place a 9.9 out of 10 on that üî• scale.  Not only was this place unique and packed with flavor.  It held a standard I have never seen before.  Thank you Zalaca√≠n for the deliciousness and I will be back.

For future travel and food adventures look at my bio."
ChIJtXn2SPkoQg0RhldfLz_RYWk,5,Authentic spanish food restaurant in Madrid. We had lunch  there and ordered eggplant with cod and duck with marmalade and chips. Everything was so delicious. It's definitely worth visiting while in Madrid .
ChIJtXn2SPkoQg0RhldfLz_RYWk,5,"Thanks to my dear who brought me here for an amazing Spanish food experience.
The servicing was a little weird in the beginning and it got so much better after some warm up with our 1 and only dear staff that must be overwhelmed with many customers at the same time.
If I could and still staying around these area, I will definitely come to visit again üòã"
ChIJtXn2SPkoQg0RhldfLz_RYWk,5,Fantastic place with a wonderful atmosphere and superb Tapas choice. The choice of quality wines is also exceptional
ChIJtXn2SPkoQg0RhldfLz_RYWk,4,A pleasant enough place with solid tapas. Prices are a bit high.  Quality was good but nothing standout. Come for the large selection of wines.
ChIJtXn2SPkoQg0RhldfLz_RYWk,5,"Wonderful, kind and attentive service. The waitress was so nice and professional. There are thousands of wines, each one better than the one before.
Real typical Spanish food (delicious jam√≥n serrano) and the place is cozy.
Overall it was a great experience!!"
ChIJ8Qki5_YoQg0RUeTxHthzvd4,5,"Perfect evening for a beautiful team dinner in the private room upstairs. Everything was incredible- the tuna and truffle risotto was phenomenal, as was the artichoke üòç thank you so much! We will definitely be back ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJ8Qki5_YoQg0RUeTxHthzvd4,5,"What an incredible private event we had at con amor! The room itself was large and spacious, and fit 20 of us very comfortably. The artichoke and truffle risotto may be some of the best I‚Äôve ever had. The tomato starter was so unique and so flavorful, I could have eaten several. The service was fast and we were tended to at all times."
ChIJ8Qki5_YoQg0RUeTxHthzvd4,5,"Eggplant chips, artichoke with Parmesan and cheesecake‚Ä¶WOW! The eggplant and the artichoke were absolutely perfect, seriously loved it. The cheesecake was nice too but nothing too special. Would definitely go back though to try other dishes."
ChIJ8Qki5_YoQg0RUeTxHthzvd4,5,"I'm impressed. Very, very impressed! Outstanding food and exceptional wine. I highly recommend the Gambon with Kimuchi mayonnaise and the Salmon Tartar. For mains you can't go wrong will the carrilleras. I'll definitely be back to explore more options from the menu. Be sure to make your reservation using the El Tenedor app in order to get your discount of up to 40% on your meal bill (drinks apart)."
ChIJ8Qki5_YoQg0RUeTxHthzvd4,5,Outstanding food and excellent service. We tried different plates and everything was very well done.
ChIJl7-_nfkoQg0Rcu_bPyq-6_8,5,"Will definitely come back, the food was amazing, I lived in. Italy for 4 years and now moved to Madrid. Happy to say that I found a restaurant where food is like in Italy and atmosphere is very cozy. Highly recommend!"
ChIJl7-_nfkoQg0Rcu_bPyq-6_8,5,I have been eating at Due Amici for over 20 years. Fantastic food at great prices and superior service. Salvatore the owner is a real Italian and a fantastic chef. Highly recommended and a must on Italian cuisine.üëçüëçüëç
ChIJl7-_nfkoQg0Rcu_bPyq-6_8,4,"Authentic Italian trattoria. I know this place from long time and always they deliver the most authentic home made Italian food.
It is worth a dinner there or more :-). Good prices and of course very good food. Don't forget ask for the tiramisu.
Remember is trattoria, small, casual and authentic."
ChIJl7-_nfkoQg0Rcu_bPyq-6_8,5,Absolutely delicious Italian restaurant. Fresh made pasta to die for! Will definately be going back. Thank you üôèüèº
ChIJl7-_nfkoQg0Rcu_bPyq-6_8,5,Authentic Italian that really made me feel like I was visiting Italy again. Friendly staff and quiet neighborhood for a relaxing evening.
ChIJg1LX4fEoQg0ROtFyf951QuQ,5,"Dining at Lua was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The quality of the food, the attention to detail, and the overall ambiance make it a standout in Madrid‚Äôs culinary scene.

We started with the octopus, which was beautifully prepared‚Äîtender, flavorful, and a perfect way to begin the meal. The freshly baked bread they offer is also worth mentioning‚Äîwarm, soft, and truly delicious.

For the main course, I had the steak with fries. The steak was cooked to absolute perfection, bursting with flavor and expertly seasoned. It was accompanied by crisp, golden fries that balanced the dish nicely.

Additionally, Lua‚Äôs wine selection is outstanding. The variety and quality available are impressive, with options that perfectly complement the menu.

Without a doubt, I‚Äôll be returning next time I‚Äôm in town. Highly recommend for anyone seeking refined cuisine and top-tier service in Madrid."
ChIJg1LX4fEoQg0ROtFyf951QuQ,5,"Amazing restaurant, super friendly staff, amazing tasting menu. It was an amazing experience. I highly recommend it. They also made my 6 year old son feel welcome!

Definitely coming back"
ChIJg1LX4fEoQg0ROtFyf951QuQ,5,"Although it lost its Michelin star in 2023, L√∫a is still a fantastic restaurant. The chef, Manuel Dom√≠nguez, enhances traditional Galician dishes with unique creative elements. It's an excellent stepping stone into haute cuisine, without the sometimes exuberant mannerism of more distinguished places. While you can order individual dishes, we opted for the tasting menu. Consisting of 2 appetizers, 3 starters, 2 main dishes and 2 desserts, it is adequately priced at ‚Ç¨92 per person. The quality is on par with what you would typically get in a traditional-leaning 1-Michelin-star restaurant. Our highlights were the peach gazpacho and the foie micuit with pear and caramelized cheese. While I'm not a fan of the traditional Santiago cake for dessert, the coulant version they make at L√∫a is amazing. The only thing that could be improved are the meat dishes: you can choose between suckling pig and squab, but both rely a bit too much on the sauce they are served with. Other than that, we had a great dinner in a relatively casual atmosphere."
ChIJg1LX4fEoQg0ROtFyf951QuQ,4,What a surprising and great dinner! We had a fantastic meal where we tried incredible and interesting dishes. The pigeon was the star of the show! It would‚Äôve been perfect if the wine pairing could‚Äôve been explained a bit better or in general a bit more time for service and enjoyment of the atmosphere was possible.
ChIJg1LX4fEoQg0ROtFyf951QuQ,4,"We went there upon recommendations from friends. The place is nicely decorated and wait staff were friendly and spoke English well.

We had the degustation menu. The menu was definitely interesting and the kitchen definitely tries to experiment with flavours. I think the highlight is definitely the cappuccino dish. Visually interesting and flavours were good. A couple of dishes like the fish and roast pork could be better balanced with flavours. For example, the hoi sin sauce on the roast pork could be much stronger.

Overall, it was a nice experience and with a few minor tweaks in the flavours I think this restaurant is amazing."
ChIJj5_oQvkoQg0RRbH8bIlLDTM,1,Rip off.. I ordered a paella with seafood for 21 euros and quantity was for a kids meal.. absolutely disgraceful.. hardly any seafood in it.. stay  away from this place‚Ä¶
ChIJj5_oQvkoQg0RRbH8bIlLDTM,5,"Great apetizer to start with, then everything was as delicious. Be sure to take the ""Doble o nada"" dessert, you might get it for free if you manage to roll a double with two dice!"
ChIJj5_oQvkoQg0RRbH8bIlLDTM,5,Food excellent.dogs are permitted.l recommend this restaurant
ChIJj5_oQvkoQg0RRbH8bIlLDTM,4,"Quite unusually, I had a hamburger. I was tempted by its description on the menu. It was fabulous, cooked al punto which would never happen in Canada."
ChIJj5_oQvkoQg0RRbH8bIlLDTM,5,"Great place to eat, really cozy."
ChIJRU6UxoooQg0RLVFkKuI4Z2s,4,"Your average no fuss bar with a good selection of classic tapas. We came here based on a recommendation and luckily managed to get a table. Ended up sitting inside because outside was full on a typical summer evening. The tapas options were good and the service was ok. The waitress forgot a dish but quickly processed it when we reminded her. Seems to a be family run place. If you want o experience the local spanish bars with local food, this is a spot to come to. Prices are ok. Maybe a bit higher than what you would expect to pay, but would come back.."
ChIJRU6UxoooQg0RLVFkKuI4Z2s,5,"I have been to this place so many times, it's one of my favourites for gluten-free tapas in the city! They don't really advertise it, but almost the entire menu is suitable for coeliacs, there are only a few items that aren't (I think they're currently the items in red on the menu, but always worth checking with the waiting staff).

Typical old-fashioned Spanish bar inside, with a little terrace in the lovely Plaza de Olavide. It is very popular so might be hard to get a table, but it is well worth it."
ChIJRU6UxoooQg0RLVFkKuI4Z2s,5,"Delicious tapas in typical Spanish tapas bar. If you want to feel the Spanish vibe and enjoy - this is a place for you! We came twice and already miss this place, truly recommended."
ChIJRU6UxoooQg0RLVFkKuI4Z2s,5,"Delicious location for lunch.
We ordered Pulpo a la gallega - Galician Octupus
Patatas Bravas or Bravas for short - toasted potatoes in a spicy sauce and a house salad.

The environment is awesome and very friendly. Highly recommend.

All plates are made to share so be mindful of that when ordering."
ChIJRU6UxoooQg0RLVFkKuI4Z2s,5,"The quintessential neighbourhood tapas bar, but one that‚Äôs worth a journey. The location of this bar, on an octagonal plaza, is interesting enough, but the bar just does everything so well. A stock of La Chouffe beers says they really care and the classic blackboard of tapas dishes hits the spot."
ChIJjQQ8E-0oQg0RDw0ArHu3Z44,4,Tasty food. Correct service. The Christmas Pancakes is a must try.
ChIJjQQ8E-0oQg0RDw0ArHu3Z44,5,"Really good food, nice staff, they pay attention to the details to make you feel comfortable."
ChIJjQQ8E-0oQg0RDw0ArHu3Z44,4,"The salads were great, the place was big and clean

ChIJjQQ8E-0oQg0RDw0ArHu3Z44,5,Best VIPS club sandwich we have had in Spain. Fast service and chilled out atmosphere for an early lunch.
ChIJjQQ8E-0oQg0RDw0ArHu3Z44,2,"Very Noisy,  service was very slow and hard to find... the food as you can expect from this kind of place"
ChIJnwC-Me0oQg0RhBqTnRBgn6Q,5,Lovely restaurant in Madrid. The food is excellent !! Ronaldo was really nice and was able to make good recommendations on the menu (while our Spanish skills are close to 0). You must try the croquetas !!!
ChIJnwC-Me0oQg0RhBqTnRBgn6Q,3,"We had booked a table for 15 people, all coworkers who wanted to have our year end dinner and the overall experience was ok but we came across a very annoying situation: we intended to Pay with our american express cards, and in ""the fork"" it is clearly stated ""AMEX welcome"". On their google summary
it appears as well, but when asked they told us amex is.not accepted, and some members of the group were not able to Pay for their dinner. Even so we decided to continue with the order and food was good but we did not even receive a complimentary detail for the inconvenience that this misinformation posed for us. Considering the size of.the group and the Bill, it would have been in order.
All things said, the grilled octopus was awesome!"
ChIJnwC-Me0oQg0RhBqTnRBgn6Q,5,"Amazing  place to eat local food

ChIJnwC-Me0oQg0RhBqTnRBgn6Q,5,"We arrived late after looking for a place where to eat for a while, and even with a full restaurant and kitchen about to close, they found a way to accommodate us. The food was excellent, good quality for money, and came very quickly. Very pleased with the service and the overall experience, although short."
ChIJnwC-Me0oQg0RhBqTnRBgn6Q,4,Great lunch menu for 20‚Ç¨ and good food
ChIJaUt3EI0oQg0Rm9tdw9PZsrM,5,"Really good restaurant with a great selection across the menu. Really great quality and generous portion sizes which you'll struggle to polish away!

Love this place!"
ChIJaUt3EI0oQg0Rm9tdw9PZsrM,5,"We had a long work team lunch here. It was fantastic. The food, the wine, the staff, the ambience all simply perfect. Very highly recommended."
ChIJaUt3EI0oQg0Rm9tdw9PZsrM,4,"Good Southern Spanish restaurant. We order ensaladilla rusa, artichokes and octopus...and everything. We will go back"
ChIJaUt3EI0oQg0Rm9tdw9PZsrM,4,Nice place or tapas beers and hang out with friends. Has a nice terrace and good wines.
ChIJaUt3EI0oQg0Rm9tdw9PZsrM,4,Food is good and the price is right. Would definitely recommend.
ChIJK2W_joooQg0ROZ7oYYYJmmI,4,"I visited this place to watch the Real Madrid Champions League final and loved the cozy atmosphere.
Beer lovers will appreciate the vast selection of imported brews.
The only drawback is the outdated, small TVs.
Despite that, it was great spot to enjoy the game."
ChIJK2W_joooQg0ROZ7oYYYJmmI,5,Nice traditional spot for some international beers - good representation of German and Belgian in particular. Table service was friendly and efficient. Nice cosy atmosphere when we were in.
ChIJK2W_joooQg0ROZ7oYYYJmmI,5,"The biggest selection of belgian beers of madrid fo shure, and a lot more from other countries. The sausage mix is a must if you want to feel a little bit more germanic. Great place to try new tasty beers."
ChIJK2W_joooQg0ROZ7oYYYJmmI,4,"Decent tap selection and fair price.  Belgians, German beers.  Close to another hotspot ‚Äì recommended"
ChIJK2W_joooQg0ROZ7oYYYJmmI,4,"Good,good beer...very classy place...not a big fan of their potato chips....but if you ask me ...you get better service...better free tapas with same style beer at L'¬£urope across the steet that's where you want to take your special someone"
ChIJI1SqiYwoQg0RoXUQqU1LuOs,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here! The menu offered a great selection of fresh, expertly prepared dishes. The service was top-notch ‚Äì friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, making for a wonderful evening out. We'll definitely be back!"
ChIJI1SqiYwoQg0RoXUQqU1LuOs,5,"An absolute experience! Super nice and helpful host, the pasta is freshly made and super authentic, even got some limoncello as a gift. Totally recommend"
ChIJI1SqiYwoQg0RoXUQqU1LuOs,4,"While in our opinion is one of the best pasta proposals in Madrid, although we think there‚Äôs a bit of room for improvement.

We ordered cheeses, and honestly we didn‚Äôt like the presentation with and the grisini on top nor some of the cheeses, one of them was very heavy on the rosemary, and another one really tasted sour. But this is more linked to our personal taste than anything else. We loved the Gorgonzola though.

Vitello Tonnato, correct, Fusilli didn‚Äôt tell us much nor taste nor presentation. Carbonara in our opinion the best one in Madrid, and the burrata and nduja ravioli that was also excellent.  We really liked the fact that half portions are offered , also the house wine from Sicily was excellent. We will be back for some more pasta."
ChIJI1SqiYwoQg0RoXUQqU1LuOs,5,"Excellent southern Italian cuisine, wonderful sauces and flavors, good fresh products, and very friendly, focused service. The only thing that we found daunting was the volume of chatter, which meant we nearly had to shout at each other to be heard. But we were there on Saturday night, so the din is sometimes to be expected in Madrid‚Äôs restaurants."
ChIJI1SqiYwoQg0RoXUQqU1LuOs,5,Cozy authentic Italian in madrid with simple delicious plates (plates licked clean). The salad with orange is a winner. Great thing is that they offer half portions of most pastas. All high quality. Will definitely return.
ChIJZxwxl_YoQg0R8Hxm93oMvhU,5,Nice place. Pinchos and beer will get you stuffed
ChIJZxwxl_YoQg0R8Hxm93oMvhU,5,"Great tapas, great atmosphere and well priced"
ChIJZxwxl_YoQg0R8Hxm93oMvhU,3,Went there for dinner with a group of friends and the service was very nice. Gave us a good table also. Despite that I didn't find the food that great and for that reason also though the price was too high. So not good value for money. To top it off some of the deserts were pretty bad (tiramisu specially).
ChIJZxwxl_YoQg0R8Hxm93oMvhU,4,"Vagalume is a bustling spot on a Saturday afternoon. We arrived at 14.00‚Äîa time right before lunch. Shortly after you will find it difficult to get a table, stand at the bar, or walk to the bathroom as it gets shoulder-to-shoulder packed. The tapas here are as hearty and generous as they are delicious.

Recommend: chuleton, steak (rare), patatas bravas, tortilla de patatas, olives"
ChIJZxwxl_YoQg0R8Hxm93oMvhU,5,"Love the tapas here with wine! Tend to get crowded, but in August, it is perfect. :)"
ChIJge-C3fYoQg0REf85ebNn13Y,5,I highly recommend this place for a romantic evening or a night out with friends. It is really cozy inside and you'll get the authentic Spanish dining experience with exceptionally friendly service. You absolutely have to try the nuestras bravas!
ChIJge-C3fYoQg0REf85ebNn13Y,4,"Great place to have dinner with friends, pretty cozy and comfy ambiance. Service is great! And the food was really good! Prices are a bit high but it‚Äôs worth for the quality and taste of the food! Really recommend it."
ChIJge-C3fYoQg0REf85ebNn13Y,5,"This was one of the most phenomenal food surprises of the year for us. The place is modest and unassuming and small - but the flavour and quality of the dishes blew us away. Every dish we tried was an explosion of taste. It may be a little pricey, but if we come back to Madrid, this place will be top of our list"
ChIJge-C3fYoQg0REf85ebNn13Y,5,We had a wonderful gastronomic experience. Patatas Bravas full of flavor and the tacos were also a welcome surprise. Couldn‚Äôt recommend enough!
ChIJge-C3fYoQg0REf85ebNn13Y,5,Very good quality of food :) the fish dishes we can highly recommend!
ChIJD3ylSvEoQg0R3jZbeqV0kSc,1,"Slow service and the worst double espresso ever, for 5‚Ç¨!"
ChIJD3ylSvEoQg0R3jZbeqV0kSc,1,Cold fast food and no comments...
ChIJD3ylSvEoQg0R3jZbeqV0kSc,1,"After more than 30 minutes of waiting, the waiter decided to place our order.
He serves us a daikiri with salt instead of sugar, calling me ‚Äúamor‚Äù, I went there to say it several times, to 3 different people. They made fun of us and we had to ask 3 times for them to change our glass. This is unacceptable, I have never seen this in my life. I told him ‚Äúyou‚Äôre stupid‚Äù he laughed
Worst service in the world!!!!"
ChIJD3ylSvEoQg0R3jZbeqV0kSc,1,"We ate a la carte to celebrate a birthday. Two people.
They served us half a portion of rabas that smelled bad, they were soft; The waitress and the waiter recognized it, both said that they themselves had noticed the smell, but when they asked the cook he told them that he had washed them very well and they took them away from us!
Neither the chicken wok nor the oxtail were worth anything. They apologized to us and invited us to a cheesecake, but it was pure paste. A horror, although they apologized and tried to fix it, without success because the quality is very bad."
ChIJD3ylSvEoQg0R3jZbeqV0kSc,1,Very bad service on the terrace of the Retiro Park. The very rude waiter. To not return
ChIJrw5i-PYoQg0RDTkOFon-_lY,3,"The ambience is great with park benches and the food is served in big platters that gives a traditional BBQ vibe. We ordered pulled pork sandwich, baby back ribs, brisket, hot dog and mac and cheese. Both the baby back ribs and brisket were dry and a bit over cooked and needed to be glazed with their bbq sauce significantly. The mac and cheese and pulled pork sandwich were quite good. For dessert we ordered the carrot cake, the double chocolate tart and the cookie they were good, the best one was the double chocolate tart."
ChIJrw5i-PYoQg0RDTkOFon-_lY,4,"Nice place with a lot of natural light for meat lovers. They have a wide range of dishes from roasted chicken to smashed potatoes. Most dishes were good, yet the quality of them was unequally good. The staff was nice but it felt a little chaotic at times."
ChIJrw5i-PYoQg0RDTkOFon-_lY,3,"Now they admit reservation via their web service. Some issues with the Wallet service for saving your reservation but overall ok.
Service was nice and attentive an assigned us a big table (The place was not really full as use to be)
The ""oven was broken"" so no ribs today ... a pity as we were looking to have some nice smokey ribs. OK llet¬¥s move forward.
We order chicken wings for stater,  pretty nice and tasty sauce.
Then brisket and pullet pork sandwich. Brisket was a complete disappointment, lacking flavour and texture,  no sings of barbecue in taste profile, pullet pork was nice but nothing you cannot find in multiple other places today.
I ordered a Porter beer, that was interesting but too much of a forced ""bring more intense and distinctive flavour to my beer"" for my taste, and not worth the price in my humble opinion.

Botton line I have fond memories of this place, that seem like is on a ""decay mode"" after the years. That includes the food, and even the webpage and reservations system with several errors that provides a sense of abandonment to the business.

A pity because I liked the place but I won¬¥t be returning any time soon.

A really nice BBQ place with a good selection of beers on tap. If you realize this is Madrid no Texas, the place is a fantastic place for some american style slow cooked smoked meats. No reservations allowed so be patient on weekends as could be busy"
ChIJrw5i-PYoQg0RDTkOFon-_lY,4,"Cosy restaurant which specialty is smoked meat, one of the few in Madrid. Same environment as in Texas, with long wooden sharing tables.
Having tried the real deal several times, I can‚Äôt say the smoked meat end result is the same as in Texas, but quites resembles.
Prices are reasonable and staff is super friendly, hence very much recommendable."
ChIJrw5i-PYoQg0RDTkOFon-_lY,5,Great place to have a traditional american bbq. Place needs to improve atmosphere
ChIJg1fh5vYoQg0RhW-nOCnahOs,5,"Candeli has a magical kitchen. Always a pleasure eating in this restaurant. They work with seasonal produce. The juicy meat, deliciously grilled fish, fresh tartar, or a tomato salad with top quality tomatoes üçÖ to name a few. For me: T-Bone steak from Discarlux is heavenly ü•©üçæ and even more delicious when enjoyed with some really good champagne.üçæ I‚Äôm always being welcomed with a big smile and a hug. The magic that owners Alberto and Francisco have brought to this place is noticeable, Thank you! üôèüèºüòäüçΩÔ∏è"
ChIJg1fh5vYoQg0RhW-nOCnahOs,5,Awesome bar and restaurant in the fashionable and vibrant ponzano street. Candeli has a great bar and restaurant area with high tables for more informal dinner and formal restaurant. Wide selection of both meat and fish dishes and all the food was very fresh and delicious
ChIJg1fh5vYoQg0RhW-nOCnahOs,5,"REALLY GOOD FOOD FOR REASONABLE PRICE. From outside this restaurant looks like a normal restaurant/bar in Spain, but inside it had really elegant ambience. They offer delicious & high-end food, & considering that, it's not very expensive."
ChIJg1fh5vYoQg0RhW-nOCnahOs,5,Very fresh and good quantity of food. It‚Äôs on the pricier side of Ponzano but service is nice.
ChIJg1fh5vYoQg0RhW-nOCnahOs,5,"Absolutely amazing, had walked the streets couldn‚Äôt find anywhere to eat. They were so accommodating,  We had a large party. The food was outstanding, the Service was unsurpassed. It is a must if you have only one night to eat at a  Restaurant."
ChIJ8-1d5_YoQg0RYDzlTHqfhjs,2,"Marvelous coffee reminded me of river thames. I recommend the food if you haven‚Äôt eaten in a week, only way you‚Äôll enjoy it. The staff were cool though"
ChIJ8-1d5_YoQg0RYDzlTHqfhjs,4,Good tapas for a fair price. I'm not an expert in croquetas but these were better than some I ate in fancier places.
ChIJ8-1d5_YoQg0RYDzlTHqfhjs,1,"Worst experiance in Madrid! Nobody was speaking English to begin with butbwe could cimmunicate with hands and feet. We ordered couple of different croquettes, one was worse than the other...but the top was the chicken enchilada, it tasted like plastic. All pre-cooked and just heated up before serving l assume. The melted cheese was frozen on the top :(  Very dissapointing experience."
ChIJ8-1d5_YoQg0RYDzlTHqfhjs,5,Just had a great tapas dinner here. There was a nice variety of dishes all made from local fare. The wine list had a nice and good variety and the wait staff were super friendly. We showed up without a reservation on a Thursday and managed to have a table for five.
ChIJ8-1d5_YoQg0RYDzlTHqfhjs,5,Top!
ChIJJxXdM_QoQg0RyCr-Y8TQfVk,5,"I was hesitant to come as I was unsure of how authentic the food would be. As someone deeply connected to South Louisiana cuisine, my standards for the food are high.

I‚Äôm so glad I went! The food was delicious and so flavorful! It tasted like home. The roux of the gumbo was well made and the fried green tomatoes were cooked to perfection!

I highly recommend Trikki! They‚Äôve done an exceptional job of bringing the flavors of South Louisiana to Spain!"
ChIJJxXdM_QoQg0RyCr-Y8TQfVk,5,"This is the real thing! The food is probably the best I‚Äôve had in Spain so far, it‚Äôs truly authentic New Orleans cuisine, we had the blooming onion, the crawfish croquetas, the ‚Äúto die for‚Äù gumbo, the delicious crawfish pasta and of course the magical beignets, and to top it all off the staff are the sweetest, chapeau bas to the Chef and this amazing cozy Cajun joint!"
ChIJJxXdM_QoQg0RyCr-Y8TQfVk,5,"We had the pleasure of dining here twice during a recent visit to Madrid. Having visited and eaten my way through NOLA frequently, I have to say the food here is LEGIT!  The flavors and spices are spot on.  I loved everything that I tried, but have to say my favorite was the Forrest Gump Shrimp Po'Boy.  The shrimp was perfectly spiced & fried, it was dressed as a Po'Boy should and that Cajun mayo/sauce was pure fire. However I have to say the bread that they used was special and pulled the whole thing together.  This was a great sandwich made perfect by the bread they used.  This place is now a must stop when I'm in Madrid."
ChIJJxXdM_QoQg0RyCr-Y8TQfVk,5,"We got the three most traditional NOLA dishes, fried green tomatoes, gumbo, and jambalaya. They were all delicious!! We also got a pisco sour and a hurricane to drink- also very good. There was really nothing whatsoever to complain about. The service was great, the food and drinks were delicious, the feel and decor was lovely. We did make a reservation but even on a Friday night I'm not sure we would have needed it- but it was August (a slow month). Definitely 5 stars!"
ChIJJxXdM_QoQg0RyCr-Y8TQfVk,5,Wonderful tasty sabroso food. Mardi Gras Shrimps are top notch and the software shell crab. And for dessert the Quesillo with lime or the divine brownie. Loved every bite.
ChIJq6ra4fYoQg0RxQW2JwWxGiM,5,"This restaurant's story and the combination of the feast they offer deserves a Michlein Star!..
Starters are very delicious and it changes the taste once you have it all at once!..
Fish and the meat was amazing...
Also the ravioli needs to be tasted!!
If you can find a spot, do not miss it, it is a must go one üëåüèª"
ChIJq6ra4fYoQg0RxQW2JwWxGiM,5,"A must visit place if you happen to be in Madrid and you like more unique places and tastes. A bit on the expensive side, but it definitely worths it! The menu is small, but the food is tasty and the wine very nice. Make sure to get a reservation, as it does not have many tables. I would recommend to try the basque pastry with chocolate. Delicious!!!"
ChIJq6ra4fYoQg0RxQW2JwWxGiM,3,It was not to our liking. The food looks good but most of it tastes average and a bit pricy for that quality. The waiters were a dismissive of our complaint that the white wine tasted bad (tasted like a wine that was open and not well refrigerated). The decor and the place inside is nice.
ChIJq6ra4fYoQg0RxQW2JwWxGiM,5,Amazing basque tapas bar. Totally recommended. The modern Gilda and Taco Azul were 10 out of 10
ChIJq6ra4fYoQg0RxQW2JwWxGiM,5,What a gem. Pricey but unique dining experience. Influence of pickles is super nice touch and flair of Basque cuisine
ChIJvf5LSPQoQg0RMuAcmMIcSF4,5,"Ignore the low reviews, it‚Äôs under new management and is amazing! Great prices and service and food, shout to the waiter. Classic Madrid terraza"
ChIJvf5LSPQoQg0RMuAcmMIcSF4,2,Regularcillo
ChIJvf5LSPQoQg0RMuAcmMIcSF4,5,"The local is clean and the staff is really friendly. The food is tasty and came fast, but an important thing to note is that you can only pay with card."
ChIJvf5LSPQoQg0RMuAcmMIcSF4,4,"Bar with quite a terrace, part covered and part not. There was quite a variety of both skewers and portions. We ordered bacon and cheese skewers and some bravas potatoes. Everything in general was good and they are quite a good size. The service was very fast and attentive."
ChIJvf5LSPQoQg0RMuAcmMIcSF4,1,"We got to the terrace and asked for the ""alerjenos"" menu, something that by law they should have and don't have. Next we ordered some braviolis in which the brava sauce looked like nothing more than tomato sauce and some torreznos of which I am going to attach a photo so that you can look for them among the potatoes.
Terrible portions, we will definitely not return"
ChIJ6X61wsIoQg0RMUAGAw5qafs,4,"We had the lunch menu. 17 euros per person they included 2 courses, bread, drink, and dessert or coffee or tea. The food was good relative to the cost. The servings were filling. We especially liked the salmorejo and the tiras de ternera. Service was excellent."
ChIJ6X61wsIoQg0RMUAGAw5qafs,5,"THE FOOD: really good. Had the croquettes as a starter, filet steak and lobbo tartar (excellent!) as mains.

THE SERVICE: friendly and attentive

THE RESTAURANT: modern style, relatively quiet as not many people went"
ChIJ6X61wsIoQg0RMUAGAw5qafs,5,"Very nice discovery ! The restaurant is very well decorated and elegant. The service was very nice and friendly. The food was great, the meat was very good and perfectly cooked. I'll definitely come back"
ChIJ6X61wsIoQg0RMUAGAw5qafs,4,"A lovely little restaurant for sure. The food was great, but nothing extraordinary (I save my 5 stars for restaurants that get very inventive with food or that have exceptionally good ambiance). We ordered salmorejo, artichokes and tuna tartare. This is a good spot for a casual date or a dinner with friends."
ChIJ6X61wsIoQg0RMUAGAw5qafs,5,We made a reservation and the place was not packed. Nice environment and great servers. Prices were fair. Quiet place where you can engage in conversation without a lot of noise
ChIJu1njWsEoQg0ReYtYGHlDXfg,5,"Focused on its executive menu, the restaurant pleasantly surprises with a quality offer at an affordable price. Careful presentation of the dishes reflects attention to detail, elevating the dining experience. Generous portions satisfy the appetite, and the quality of the entrec√¥te is exceptional, as are the tasty ‚Äúhuevos rotos‚Äù and appetizers that tantalize the taste buds.

The terrace, while not extravagant, provides a pleasant space to enjoy outdoor dining. While my experience has been limited to the executive menu, the outstanding quality of the dishes and their presentation, coupled with the pleasant ambiance of the terrace, make this place an ideal option to savor exquisite dishes without overlooking your budget."
ChIJu1njWsEoQg0ReYtYGHlDXfg,1,"Food was veryyyy normal. We ordered pinchos and the bread and cheese were very dry and seemed old.
Burger also wasn't very special.
I am writing so that the improve the food because they have a nice bar, location and a terrace outside in the beautiful sun. What's missing is some good food!"
ChIJu1njWsEoQg0ReYtYGHlDXfg,4,"Great food, incredibly cheap. Excellent service and lovely people."
ChIJu1njWsEoQg0ReYtYGHlDXfg,4,"I had the fried Iberico pork dish. I initially though ‚Ç¨18 was a bit too expensive for one dish, but the portion was very large and quite tasty, so that‚Äôs fair. The service was on the slow side but the waiter was nice. Decent place to have lunch."
ChIJu1njWsEoQg0ReYtYGHlDXfg,5,"Nothing to appoint but beware that it‚Äôs small, so you should make a reservation in advance, and doses are large. In our case we couldn‚Äôt finish all, even thou it was delicious.

A place to repete‚Ä¶"
ChIJAUsXreUoQg0RUd4sbFf4BMA,5,Unassuming but clean and comfortable restaurant. Quality and price ratio very interesting. Men√∫ del d√≠a abundant and tasty. Service is fast and efficient. Restaurant serves other dishes a la carte. Worth trying out.
ChIJAUsXreUoQg0RUd4sbFf4BMA,3,A good place for a quick bite. Not a very touristic place but rather a place where the locals go. Good to experience such places to have a break from busy and touristic places. The staff were super friendly although the churros were kind of oily and we had to clean our own table due to high turnover with only one waiter to serve. Good value for money.
ChIJAUsXreUoQg0RUd4sbFf4BMA,3,"Looks quite old, like places with provate rooms, maybe, with too much noise for me putting plates, cups and spoons for breakfast coffees... Well, maybe it is a good scenario for an old movie."
ChIJAUsXreUoQg0RUd4sbFf4BMA,5,"very nice restaurant, everything went good üòä"
ChIJAUsXreUoQg0RUd4sbFf4BMA,5,Delicious coffee and tortilas.
ChIJpT2p9eQoQg0Rkgcux5AFgjs,5,"Food is great, but have not met such great level of service in Spain yet."
ChIJpT2p9eQoQg0Rkgcux5AFgjs,5,"Loved it! The food is great, the place is really nice and the service is exceptional. Alicia was amazing. A must!"
ChIJpT2p9eQoQg0Rkgcux5AFgjs,3,Good atmosphere. Nice waiters. But it is not worth spending more than 50 euros for a meal reheated in the microwave.
ChIJpT2p9eQoQg0Rkgcux5AFgjs,5,Great restaurant hidden in the financial district.  Omg the food was awesome.  Ate soo much.   Bring an empty stomach.
ChIJpT2p9eQoQg0Rkgcux5AFgjs,5,If you want to try the real Spanish pinchos! üî•
ChIJzcyMy-woQg0REQwVJ_fO3eQ,4,"The place is very nice. The staff is very attentive and the service was great. To start we had boquerones and pan con tomate. We had the Salmon and the sirloin as mains. The portions are what I consider to be on the small side for the price hence the 4 stars. I think that the portions can be a little bigger and still have a nice presentation. The salmon was well cooked and the glaze was a nice touch. The sirloin with frites has a very tiny sauce that is not enough to enjoy it all. They must serve more sauce. For dessert we had the Tatin tart with ice cream, the flan, and the chocolate coulant with ice cream. They were all nice except for the quality if the ice cream which I think could be better. I would recommend the place although they can do a little better with portions and quality of the ice cream on the desserts."
ChIJzcyMy-woQg0REQwVJ_fO3eQ,5,"Definitely one of the best restaurants in madrid. I‚Äôve been going there for years and the food is always great, you can taste the freshness of the ingredients, the atmosphere beautiful and elegant, but today the service was really great. They actually advised us to remove a couple of plates because we were ordering too much then brought us a tasting plate of each so we can try them. We had a great time. Thank you to the lovely team."
ChIJzcyMy-woQg0REQwVJ_fO3eQ,5,"The ambience, the vibes of the place was amazing.
They helped us choose are dishes according to our preferences. Very friendly. Loved their service and nature.
The food was mind-blowing. The croquetas just melt in your mouth, that was the best part.
The fish with asparagus, I have never had great salmon with the flavoured incurred in it.
The linguine, its sauce was mouth-watering. I couldnt stop myself but finish it all.
Desert was chocolate coulant with ice cream, the flavours blended so very well together.
We had such a lovely experience being here. It was a perfect place for us."
ChIJzcyMy-woQg0REQwVJ_fO3eQ,3,"The ambiance of this place was great and definitely an awesome place to have a large gathering. Restaurant is very spacious with a lot of larger tables. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. I give it a 3 star because the food sadly let us down but we will definitely  return to enjoy summer drinks on the patio. Maybe it's the dishes we ordered, although the presentation was nice they lacked flavour. The tuna and avocado had a very fishy smell and flavour. We also got the Russian steak & sirloin with bernaise sauce. The Russian steak didn't have any flavour could have used more salt and pepper, the mushroom ravioli was very empty and unappetizing and the sirloin could have been a better quality with more of a sauce.

But we will return simply because the staff and ambiance were amazing & will try other dishes. Stay tuned for an update!"
ChIJzcyMy-woQg0REQwVJ_fO3eQ,5,"Madrid have plenty offers regarding restaurant‚Äôs, this is one of the best. International  type of food, with a simple yet rich menu‚Äôs; the oysters bar is second to none. The service is attentive and courteous and the prices are in the range of establishments of this quality in Madrid. You will not regretted"
ChIJoRkIVamMQQ0RlLGpgzeAxzA,5,"This spectacular evening exceeded my high expectations for a 2 Michelin star restaurant. I knew going in that the first few bites would be served in various areas of the building, which I thought would be a bit strange, but it was great. It really set the mood for the whole experience, starting with a drink and accompanying bites in a two very different lounges, two very different areas of the wonderful wine cellar, and in the kitchen, before moving to a table.

I opted for the premium wine pairings, which turned out to be well worth the steep price. 11 wines, most Spanish, all beautiful, and several absolutely outstanding. I knew one wouldn‚Äôt suit my taste, and the sommelier gladly found a substitute.

The 11 courses at the table also did not disappoint. Each was both playful and expertly crafted. The progression of flavours and textures was great, and the service and pacing perfect.

Overall, the experience was world-class. Very highly recommended, well worth the high price."
ChIJoRkIVamMQQ0RlLGpgzeAxzA,3,"Underwhelming visit. For a two-Michelin-starred restaurant, the food lacked impact‚Äîseveral dishes were bland, and I even found bones where there shouldn‚Äôt have been. The pacing of the menu felt rushed, with little regard for my requests to slow things down.

The wine cellar is impressive, but the list itself is surprisingly limited and uninspired. Choosing wine on a tablet instead of browsing a proper list at the table felt out of place in a restaurant of this level.

Service was efficient but robotic, lacking warmth or personal touch. Overall, the experience didn‚Äôt live up to the price tag‚Äîpoor value for money and far from the standard one expects from such a highly rated spot."
ChIJoRkIVamMQQ0RlLGpgzeAxzA,5,"What an experience. The food, wine, service and scenery were incredible. It was a great way to kick off our honeymoon in Madrid!! Highly recommend!!"
ChIJoRkIVamMQQ0RlLGpgzeAxzA,5,"At Coque, diners embark on a meticulously curated four-part culinary journey crafted by the Sandoval brothers. The experience commences in the cocktail bar, where guests are greeted with inventive snacks and a signature drink. The second act unfolds in the wine cellar, boasting an impressive selection of over 3,000 labels curated by sommelier Rafael Sandoval. The journey continues into the kitchen, offering an intimate glimpse into the creative process of chef Mario Sandoval and his dedicated team. The finale takes place in the elegant dining room, where ma√Ætre d‚Äô Diego Sandoval ensures impeccable service. The 15-course tasting menu showcases innovative dishes such as hoisin-glazed razor clams and lobster tartare infused with green chilies, exemplifying Coque‚Äôs commitment to culinary excellence."
ChIJoRkIVamMQQ0RlLGpgzeAxzA,5,Truly one of the best restaurant experiences I‚Äôve ever experienced. A unique presentation of food that was immersive and truly out of this world. Started with a great appetizer and cocktail paring. Traveled into their wine cave with more pairings. Was brought into the kitchen to try more bites and ended up sitting down for some amazing courses and ending with a fabulous dessert. Everything was full of flavor and truly superb. Definitely recommend!!
ChIJDfxP_uooQg0RWGrRIVOe6-I,5,"I had two breakfasts and a lunch time snack with beer in this Tapas bar. Service was excellent, food tasty, decor included colourful tiles and a pull out counter on  the back wall added to the functionality and character. Toilet was clean and had all necessities. Seemed popular also with locals. Would definitely come again if in the neighbourhood."
ChIJDfxP_uooQg0RWGrRIVOe6-I,5,"Great place to come and chill. Awesome music, great drinks and you get a lot for what you pay. Tony the manager is an amazing host and great work ethic. Drinks are super size. He serves 'a-la-mode' drinks and isn't afraid to welcome you like a local."
ChIJDfxP_uooQg0RWGrRIVOe6-I,5,"They took in my backpack as I was applying for a visa at the nearby Embassy... The only bar in the area which accepted to do that. I came back for it and ordered a coffee, great service and very friendly and natural staff. She even gave me a look ""you don't need to thank me so much"" üòÖ"
ChIJDfxP_uooQg0RWGrRIVOe6-I,5,"Very tiny and warm Madrid bar. One draft beer (Estrella) and a selection of bottled beer, plus wines, spirits, etc. Was with friends and had a ball. Apparently its very popular with young people. We left when they were closing"
ChIJDfxP_uooQg0RWGrRIVOe6-I,2,"Actually the place would be nice. It‚Äôs small snd very Madrid style from the interior but when we were there, a cockroach was running around... It wouldn‚Äôt be that bad if it were to come in and leave but we were there for almost an hour and we saw it all the time... we wanted to eat smthg there but reconsidered after seing it"
ChIJM-ob7esoQg0Rze_-o_PldOI,1,I had an extremely disappointing experience. The service was absolutely terrible ‚Äî the staff were unbelievably rude and made me feel completely unwelcome. It seemed like helping customers was a burden for them. I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are plenty of better options where you‚Äôll actually be treated with basic respect.
ChIJM-ob7esoQg0Rze_-o_PldOI,1,The service is really rude and the good is nothing special. Not coming back because of the people. Not recommended.
ChIJM-ob7esoQg0Rze_-o_PldOI,1,They do the cafeteria at IE BUSINESS school. Charge Students 4.50 for a soup and 6‚Ç¨ for a Sandwich. 3.80‚Ç¨ for a water.
ChIJM-ob7esoQg0Rze_-o_PldOI,5,Great place for coffee or lunch (try their wraps)
ChIJM-ob7esoQg0Rze_-o_PldOI,2,"Bad customer service, below par and over-priced coffee. I work nearby and have tried to give them a chance several times, only to be disappointed every single time, even with simple orders (ie. Coffee that made me wonder if I had ordered warm milk). They also have pizza on their menu, which is a tortilla wrap with stuff on it...I would not recommend, especially with so many other great places in the vicinity."
ChIJ8dOgjxspQg0Rvq6xUwtsUI4,2,"The food was absolutely delicious. No complaints at all. Everything was super tasty and delicious.

My problem was with the servers. They took at least 20min to bring the drinks. Every time we ask for something, every little thing takes more than 20 min to come to our table. We needed plates and silverware that again took more than 20min when the food was already served. Our servers were super rude and always with an attitude. I asked for water 2 times and I'm still waiting for it.

The restaurant was a little dirty and warm when we arrived ."
ChIJ8dOgjxspQg0Rvq6xUwtsUI4,5,"Great tapas, croquetas and patatas bravas were amazing. We tried a variety of things and we liked everything. Sangria was top! We paid around 90‚Ç¨ for 9 plates and drinks, very reasonable prices. Overall, a great experience!"
ChIJ8dOgjxspQg0Rvq6xUwtsUI4,5,Loved this place! We had such a good time there
ChIJ8dOgjxspQg0Rvq6xUwtsUI4,5,"Trendy and chic restaurant well placed on the Castellana and in close proximity to the Bernab√©u Stadium. Great tapas and main dishes at a very reasonable price point given the ambience and vibe. Would definitely recommend the pinchos and expresso martini. Without a reservation, you'd need to come in early (8pm) it you want a place over the weekend."
ChIJ8dOgjxspQg0Rvq6xUwtsUI4,4,"Amazing food! The staff was really nice, but it seem too crowded for the number of people working there. I would still go again!"
ChIJHcblL-woQg0RK5DfugkZuR8,5,Nice food and good service! Love itüòò
ChIJHcblL-woQg0RK5DfugkZuR8,5,Delightful little coffee shop with great sandwiches and dessert items. I had three little sandwiches and a chocolate palm dessert with an americano. All were excellent. Highly recommended.
ChIJHcblL-woQg0RK5DfugkZuR8,4,Quick food to eat there and take away. Pastry and confectionery with great flavor. üéÇüå∞üç∞üçÆüçò
ChIJHcblL-woQg0RK5DfugkZuR8,5,"Magnificent place!! Hector is a sweetheart. A professional in the sector. I go every day and I love walking in the door and not having to say how I like the coffee. Attentive, friendly and always with a smile so you have a good day.
As for the products, everything is great!! For breakfast I recommend the muffin with tomato and EVOO.  You can take the sandwiches with you or have them at the premises warm because they not only heat the plates but the sandwiches as well.
It is a 100% recommended place!!!"
ChIJHcblL-woQg0RK5DfugkZuR8,5,"H√©ctor's attention of 10! I always order the ham sandwich with seed bread, which is super delicious, and from time to time there is a sweet treat that is also delicious! It catches me next to the office, and there being more cafes around, we always choose to come here!"
ChIJg8E4AOwoQg0RbtjZ1H2hoXM,5,"A‚ÄôBarra is a true fine dining gem in Madrid. Every dish was beautifully presented and full of flavor ‚Äî the blue lobster ravioli and steak tartare were outstanding, and the Cr√™pe Suzette dessert was the perfect finish.
Excellent wine selection (the Finger Lakes Ravines was a great recommendation), and the service was professional and discreet.
Highly recommended for anyone looking for an elegant and memorable dining experience."
ChIJg8E4AOwoQg0RbtjZ1H2hoXM,5,Amazing dishes and great staff! We had the tasting menu and all courses were delicious! Staff was very attentive and friendly. absolute recommendation for anyone who loves fine dining
ChIJg8E4AOwoQg0RbtjZ1H2hoXM,4,"As someone that was expecting something incredible, it was alright, I mean putting caviar and truffle on everything doesn‚Äôt mean it automatically tastes better. We had the tasting menu, I felt like there was something lacking‚Ä¶ oh yes, flavor, that‚Äôs it. You can tell it‚Äôs just a place where the super rich go to tell others they‚Äôve been to a ‚ÄúMichelin star‚Äù, but the ingredients were so simple, I was expecting something more complex, using rare Spanish ingredients. Also they fill you up with a big bread with butter and olive oil since the dishes are extremely tiny.

Other than that, service was good. I went for someone‚Äôs birthday, we had called earlier to confirm it was for a birthday and they completely forgot, only after we paid the check and reminded them, is when we got a little birthday surprise."
ChIJg8E4AOwoQg0RbtjZ1H2hoXM,5,"restaurant is a little tucked away in the middle of a residential area. so best to get there by walking or Uber. food was excellent. I loved the beef and appetitiser. beef looked a bit raw but when slicing it, you realise it is cooked but yet still very tender and easy to cut. fish was also very fresh. desserts was OK with some chocolate pieces and ice cream with some accompanying gelatin. but I thought service was slightly inconsistent. dishes were not served to entire table at once and at times, some dietary restrictions were also slightly overlooked."
ChIJg8E4AOwoQg0RbtjZ1H2hoXM,5,"Had organised a private dinner for 50 pax at A'Barra, and glad we picked A'Barra for our celebration. The location was convenient and the interior of the restaurant was cosy and intimate.

Service was good and the restaurant acceded to all our requests. All the staff made sure our event went well. Food was well presented, and our guests thoroughly enjoyed the five-course dinner.

Special shoutout to Marta and Enrique for liaising with us for 2 months before the event to ensure that it was an enjoyable dinner. Highly recommend this restaurant"
ChIJZ6xPwO0oQg0Rm7XpTrwlxf8,5,"Magnificent experience. It has a really nice, refined and comfortably distributed place. The attention was very fast and very friendly. The staff speaks English perfectly. Regarding the food, everything was very good, both presented and made. Great quality in their products and raw materials. I don't know if it will always be, but when I was there there was live music that accompanied the evening wonderfully. The prices per letter are very expensive, but they have offers through other means such as Groupon available to everyone, and it is appreciated. To repeat, 100% recommended."
ChIJZ6xPwO0oQg0Rm7XpTrwlxf8,3,"It was the first time we went for Christmas dinner. We had very good references, but there were three negative points, which have lowered the grade I gave it. The Cod was very salty, the Lobster was bland for me, and finally the Pink Panther Invention, which had a strange flavor.  Otherwise, the service was excellent and first class...it must be said."
ChIJZ6xPwO0oQg0Rm7XpTrwlxf8,5,"A high-class restaurant attached to a five-star hotel. There are several types of fixed menus, so it is economical to choose from them. Please be careful not to dress too casually as this may disturb other customers. No need to dress up. T-shirts and shorts just don't cut it. The cuisine is nouveau Spanish, and the chef seems to like trying new things. Please try it once. I think it will be a good memory."
ChIJZ6xPwO0oQg0Rm7XpTrwlxf8,4,"Restaurant next to the Miguel √Ångel hotel. Kitchen I give it a 4/5. Correct service, not even for 5 stars. Recommended is the Sirloin Wellington with Foie and truffle sauce."
ChIJZ6xPwO0oQg0Rm7XpTrwlxf8,4,"Nice place. Extensive menu with quality products.
Suitable for a meal with family or couples"
ChIJnUU0lesoQg0RWv3cGoBE-e8,5,Inexpensive good quality food with a nice atmosphere. They have a burrito/bowl bar with several protein options and ample salsa choices. The nachos are very good too. One of the few places around that offers free refills on soft drinks. Beer is also available.
ChIJnUU0lesoQg0RWv3cGoBE-e8,5,Fantastic! Loved it! We used to love Chipotle in the US before it got gross. This was spot on!
ChIJnUU0lesoQg0RWv3cGoBE-e8,5,Muy muy rico. Really tasty burritos. Made of fresh ingredients. The price is fair. The location looks inviting so that you might take a refill of your drink and sit a little longer than planned :)
ChIJnUU0lesoQg0RWv3cGoBE-e8,5,"Big portions and very fast service and delivery, very good option for a quick delicious bite. Highly recommend!"
ChIJnUU0lesoQg0RWv3cGoBE-e8,5,Delicious burrito you can make your own way for a reasonable price (around 9‚Ç¨)!
ChIJDwstvusoQg0RrcReR4RxplY,1,All the food was wrong the fish and vegetables were out of date. Awful.
ChIJDwstvusoQg0RrcReR4RxplY,3,"üßãDrinks: 4/5
ü§µüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èService: 3/5
ü™ëAmbiance: 2/5

üìùNotes: I enjoyed my drinks, however I don‚Äôt feel comfortable sitting in an environment that promotes delivery (Example: The photos I shared) I feel like this cafe is more like a storage unit or a factory where the place doesn‚Äôt look appealing for customers to dine in. The service was a bit slow for shakes (and there are two ladies working) So I‚Äôm not sure whats going on. At the end of the day, I believe that cafes and dessert cafes should have workers that manage to have a good conversation with the customers and make the customers feel welcome. I‚Äôm not sure if I will come back again just because the atmosphere is ugly and the service isn‚Äôt welcoming."
ChIJDwstvusoQg0RrcReR4RxplY,1,I ordered via Glovo. They completely ignored some of the ingredients requested on the poke bowl. No peanut sauce no sesame seeds and no soy sauce. I asked for cutlery because where I am staying there‚Äôs nothing available and they didn‚Äôt bother with that either. The salad was old! Not recommended
ChIJDwstvusoQg0RrcReR4RxplY,5,"I often come here to order a Tunacado Poke for lunch. If you are looking for cheap, good and healthy food you definitely found the place! Try wraps & poke bowls and deserts (tartas) . I think they are the best options they have here.

Besides food, the interior is pretty cool & cozy adm the employees here and friendly and helpful.

Surely can recommend it!"
ChIJDwstvusoQg0RrcReR4RxplY,4,"Great place for a pit stop just across the Museo L√°zaro Galdiano. Has many healthy options, such as juices, smoothies, salads, poke bowls, and all the sweet options. After a few heavy meal days this was just what I was after and there aren‚Äôt many similar options so fully recommend! Good service and good prices!"
ChIJg8NVlusoQg0RswzQx_57MSQ,5,"We enjoyed the food. Loved the Ceviche, Burrata, black pizza and the oxtail resotto."
ChIJg8NVlusoQg0RswzQx_57MSQ,5,"The best SANGRIA of Madrid!!!
Friendly waitress,
Great atmosphere and food!"
ChIJg8NVlusoQg0RswzQx_57MSQ,5,I waited for these nachos üòÇ they were really good and spicy üëå
ChIJg8NVlusoQg0RswzQx_57MSQ,5,Great food. Good prices.
ChIJg8NVlusoQg0RswzQx_57MSQ,5,"I really like the Black Truffle oil pizza. It‚Äôs called Boletus Pizza on the menu. I can eat a whole one myself, they‚Äôre not too thick. The sangria is good too. The google app is good for checking out when it‚Äôs going to be very busy.
Last time I was there we got in about 4:50pm and it was very busy. When we left an hour later it was almost empty."
ChIJS1fpDu0oQg0RW7ZZqpiMbRk,5,"Very cosy environment, good pizza with fresh ingredients (I had the one with artichokes, it was delicious) and last but not least, super kind service and honest prices.
Five well deserved stars!
PS I was here also over lunch, tried the sallad buffet that is also very good and fresh"
ChIJS1fpDu0oQg0RW7ZZqpiMbRk,5,I loved the quesadilla here. My partner had pepperoni pizza and thought it was quite tasty.
ChIJS1fpDu0oQg0RW7ZZqpiMbRk,3,"Food was not bad, music was nice, but stuff actually was not very friendly. Generally don‚Äôt wanna come back again, I felt really strange there."
ChIJS1fpDu0oQg0RW7ZZqpiMbRk,5,"Big salads (almost impossible to finish). You choose your own ingredients, all of very nice quality. In my opinion the best ""fast"" salad bar of Madrid. Go before 2PM or after 3PM if you want to avoid a long line."
ChIJS1fpDu0oQg0RW7ZZqpiMbRk,5,Excellent pizza... I ordered Diavola
ChIJQVTFeesoQg0RUaERni-PDPY,5,"I experienced an amazing time here. The food was excellent, so tasty and delicious, everything was homemade.
Also, everyone was very friendly and polite, nice and didn‚Äôt mind to explain anything whatever I asked about the menu.
I‚Äôll definitely go back whenever I go to Madrid again. Thank you so much!"
ChIJQVTFeesoQg0RUaERni-PDPY,5,"Food was excellent, service was great and the restaurant is very handsome. I look forward to returning and to exploring more of the menu. Lunch highlights include delicious black truffle croquetas, a fish dish consisting of two fried eggs on top of cod with saut√©ed chives that was delicious, a fantastic hamburger and a very tasty grilled pita-like bread filled with melted cheese, herbs and thinly sliced tomato. We ordered the ginger ""infusi√≥n"" that was spectacular and was well accompanied by delicious home made baklava."
ChIJQVTFeesoQg0RUaERni-PDPY,5,Thank you Laura and your family!  We felt as though we were the only guests there. And that each course was made with exceptional heart and skill - just for us.
ChIJQVTFeesoQg0RUaERni-PDPY,4,"Excellent wait staff, good food though a bit expensive. The restaurant's interior is gorgeous. So you're paying good money for a beautiful atmosphere and attentive, kind service."
ChIJQVTFeesoQg0RUaERni-PDPY,5,"As always... great. Service was excellent, off menu items so thoughtful... and the overall culinary experience... impressive,  thoughtful,  and greatly executed.

Gracias por sus atenciones!!!"
ChIJF1M_Du0oQg0RayCk5VWpQVE,5,"I visited for lunch, and the restaurant was quite empty.  The service was unfortunately slow, and I had to ask for assistance several times.

The burger was delicious, with wonderful flavors.  The menu offered a wide variety of choices, making it difficult to decide. Overall, I had a pleasant experience."
ChIJF1M_Du0oQg0RayCk5VWpQVE,5,"Food is good but they use sauces. If you don‚Äôt like the sauce, that‚Äôs a problem. Homemade empanadas were excellent!
Our sever, Reina, was super! Very nice and attentive!  Hard worker as she was alone and was hustling!"
ChIJF1M_Du0oQg0RayCk5VWpQVE,5,"Reina was very attentive, and made an effort to communicate, even though we do not understand Spanish, and her English is better than she said. We loved her smile‚Ä¶üòÄ"
ChIJF1M_Du0oQg0RayCk5VWpQVE,3,Lady was super helpful and enjoyed the burger and the place
ChIJF1M_Du0oQg0RayCk5VWpQVE,5,New York Burger was lovely. The food and drinks were delicious and the service was great. Would 100% recommend.
ChIJE6Q5E-0oQg0RJw8f9Nh-zww,5,"I ordered the spicy tuna tartare roll, the prawn siu mai, and an Aperol Spritz‚Äîeverything was delicious! The roll was exactly what I expected, really good. I‚Äôm excited to go back and try more from their menu. They also have a tasting menu that I‚Äôm eager to explore."
ChIJE6Q5E-0oQg0RJw8f9Nh-zww,4,"The place looks nice and the servers are great. The food was good but not amazing. The rolls are a little bit small compared to other places. We had the flambed salmon rolls and spicy tuna rolls. We had wine and the mango picante colada cocktail. We also had the spicy tuna tartar rolls, gyosas, dumplings and salmon and tuna sashimi. It was all good but not great."
ChIJE6Q5E-0oQg0RJw8f9Nh-zww,5,"Ended up there by coincidence.
Staff served me at 23:30 on Sunday night. Everyone was really friendly. Poke bowl was delicious and generous !"
ChIJE6Q5E-0oQg0RJw8f9Nh-zww,5,"Wow, great place to celebrate and adorable decor! Went here for my friends birthday dinner and I would definitely say they‚Äôre comparable to US prices for sushi but good quality. I usually stay away from sushi in Europe as I am from California and I definitely think that it is not always good but this restaurant changed my mind! the only role we did with lemon and it was very overpowering, which made it taste. The rest of the rules were great, especially my favorite foie that came with caramel sugar and raspberries that creation I have never tried with sushi. They also had a beautiful cake upon the birthday one of the best I‚Äôve seen in Madrid! They also had a great selection of cocktails and drinks."
ChIJE6Q5E-0oQg0RJw8f9Nh-zww,4,Food was good but wished the portions were slightly bigger‚Ä¶ prices are decent.
ChIJN6QQh_IoQg0RxN6g6LyvaV4,5,"Very nice place
We had degustation menu 70‚Ç¨ x 7 dishes . All very tasty and light spicy . The only dish below average was the dessert ""too simple"" ."
ChIJN6QQh_IoQg0RxN6g6LyvaV4,3,Sadly both my dishes were so salty I couldn‚Äôt finish even half (had the duck and ox tail dumplings). Service was great but they should have offered a discount since the food was inedible as so salty.
ChIJN6QQh_IoQg0RxN6g6LyvaV4,5,"We opted for the a la carte menu and were blown away by how delicious the food was. The dishes were perfect blend of traditional Chinese with Spanish modern twist. They were not only beautifully presented but super tasty too. The bone marrow dish is a must have. We also absolutely enjoyed the oxtail jiaozi, roasted duck and the sweet potato noodle dish. Looking forward to going back to try other dishes!"
ChIJN6QQh_IoQg0RxN6g6LyvaV4,3,"I was expecting more from this restaurant featured in the Michelin guide. Certainly the service needs to be improved. One of the waiter was too much informal in his approach (tone of voice, setting the table, etc). They do not have a digital menu but a physical one (plasticized paper) but not up to date. This led to frustrations. The first wine ordered was not available; the second one was supposed to be available but then they realized it was not neither and offered an alternative not communicating the difference in price.The same happened with the food menu. 3 items we would like to try were out. The excuse was they were changing the menu, which I find correct if you inform the guest upon presenting the menu and not at the moment of the order. The food was really tasty and original."
ChIJN6QQh_IoQg0RxN6g6LyvaV4,5,"We tried the ‚Ç¨65 Menu Kitchen and it was so worth it!! Totally mind-blown by how flavorful and creative the dishes were. Excellent service, cozy ambience, Chef Julio also came out to explain the concepts of different dishes to us. Would highly, highly recommend!"
ChIJuXf6KvIoQg0ROAQ2UZjWU5M,5,"Lovely atmosphere, lovely crew, lovely spread...the best breakfast we had all of our trip. Miss it everyday. So manu options and its beautifully presented and fresh.Must go and try"
ChIJuXf6KvIoQg0ROAQ2UZjWU5M,5,"Great food, great service. Definitely recommend"
ChIJuXf6KvIoQg0ROAQ2UZjWU5M,5,A nice environment to have a weekend brunch. So much food for decent value. We appreciated that the brunch started at 12pm which is rare in Madrid
ChIJuXf6KvIoQg0ROAQ2UZjWU5M,5,"Relaxed 1920's style atmosphere, very fresh tasty dishes, clean, attentive service especially Bogdan and his team"
ChIJuXf6KvIoQg0ROAQ2UZjWU5M,5,Great restaurant.  A hidden gem in Madrid. Good food. Strongly recommend a visit.
ChIJ7TtEPuooQg0Rd4q2ZFtDlPE,2,"This place could've been great. Ambience is really cool. Nice outdoor seating as well as inside.

Service sucked. Our waiter walked away from us and never brought us back a printed menu we requested.  I got up and asked someone for a menu which they handed me in a few seconds.

Then when it came to order. A new waiter came to us. He did not know the menu at all when we ask him some very basic questions about what was included in dishes. Very odd.

Food was ok. Buratta salad was super sweet. Rib eye was very fatty.

Not a great experience."
ChIJ7TtEPuooQg0Rd4q2ZFtDlPE,3,Beautiful terrace for both friends wnd family with nice and quiet atmosphere. The place is famous for Torreznos de soria which was good and I like salade but regarding ceviche and steak tartare were normal! The shrimps in ceviche were hard to chwing! The service here is normal and staffs are nice.
ChIJ7TtEPuooQg0Rd4q2ZFtDlPE,1,"We were really disappointed with our experience here. I went with two friends, and after sitting down and waiting for the line to get a little shorter, we finally got up to order when there were only about six people ahead of us. Out of nowhere, a staff member told us they wouldn‚Äôt take any more orders because of a private event starting at 6 PM even though it was only 5:38, there was no one behind us, and the place was still packed with people eating.

It would‚Äôve taken just a couple of minutes to take our quick order, and it felt completely illogical and unreasonable to turn us away after we had already waited. We were honestly shocked by how poorly handled the situation was. Definitely not the kind of treatment you‚Äôd expect from a place that seemed so welcoming at first"
ChIJ7TtEPuooQg0Rd4q2ZFtDlPE,4,"Perfect location for warm days, to dine inside or outside surrounded by a calm garden. Loved the cuisine, from the ceviche, to the meat and vegetables. As well as the family atmosphere"
ChIJ7TtEPuooQg0Rd4q2ZFtDlPE,5,"I‚Äôve been many times to Warehouse, I absolutely love their terrace.
Very nice authentic Spanish restaurant, super cozy, with nice staff. They offer a great diversity of the food , from the fish to the meat. We had an amazing paleta de Ibericos and a sea bass.
It was super delicious and we combined with their own wine. For the desert we ordered a brownie which was super delicious !!! Super recommended if you are looking for a hidden gem - amazing terrace in the centre of barrio Salamanca."
ChIJl4GWFOsoQg0Rh62cEfo_7MM,5,"Had a great time here with a party of 8 from Singapore. Food and service were excellent. The service crew was accommodating to our group who spoke no Spanish. An English menu was available, if that helps. Thanks for helping celebrate a birthday at our table!"
ChIJl4GWFOsoQg0Rh62cEfo_7MM,5,"The pinchos are top quality, I particularly liked the croqueton de carabinero, but all 4 that I have tried were perfect. It was very full so service took a bit of time, but was friendly (even I was the only non-local and  non-Spanish soeaker). If possible, I will return üòä"
ChIJl4GWFOsoQg0Rh62cEfo_7MM,4,"Conveniently located across from the US Embassy, this tapas/pintxos restaurant featured a nice variety of excellent tasting dishes. Lunch specials are offered before 1:30, which includes tapas and a drink for around 4 euros. One complaint was the extremely slow service, especially given the time we went was quite empty. Overall, it was a good choice - recommended the patatas bravas."
ChIJl4GWFOsoQg0Rh62cEfo_7MM,4,"Really nice food. We had a great burger, nice fish and chips. Grilled artichokes was amazing (according to my wife) and my venison was cooked to perfection. Make sure you say no to bread otherwise you'll see 7 Euros 80 on your bill for 4 pieces of bread (we didn't even ask for it and only ate one with nice olive oil) ü§îüòÇ. Staff was good, but I didn't really feel welcome (perhaps for my poor Spanish). üòÅüòÇ"
ChIJl4GWFOsoQg0Rh62cEfo_7MM,4,"This is a perfect place to reunite with friends to have some drinks and tapas or maybe to have dinner. We ordered three tapas and a dessert. The tacos with ear and kimchi was absolutely amazing and for me the best dish they have. For the burrata I thought they would serve it with some bread or se√±orita sticks but I was a little disappointed that it was just de salad. The huevos rotos were also amazing and truly well done. For me the dessert was incredible.
Regarding the service there were only to guys working in my area of sight and it was incredibly slow to the point were we had to wait like 45 minute only to order the dessert because no one passed by our table so we decided as soon as we ordered it to ask for the check.
As for the rest I would totally recommend this place if you want to get together with friends and have some food that is not too expensive"
ChIJ79n37fEoQg0Rzi7HDdd8pwQ,5,I guess I'm not surprised that this is some of the best sushi I've ever had in my life. As soon as you sit down the experience starts and food just starts arriving at your table. The quality of the fish is impeccable and the attention to preparation is second to none. The quality of the rice. Amazing! The texture and flavor combinations are something that have to be tried. Had some Japanese whiskey to accompany the meal and could not have been happier. This is a must try and look forward to coming again in the future.
ChIJ79n37fEoQg0Rzi7HDdd8pwQ,2,"It‚Äôs a full set sushi place. The sushi was mainly fish , very good one - but no inspired for other dishes or idea.

I think it‚Äôs too pricy for what it served. The seats by the bar were nice but it‚Äôs way too much for lunch.

I asked without fish on the grill/ oven / plancha and yet I got many dishes like this.

We paid 170‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ each:"
ChIJ79n37fEoQg0Rzi7HDdd8pwQ,3,"Expensive, terribly slow and stench of rubbish from nearby trash bins. Admittedly the set menu combining japanese dishes with a modern spanish touch is good. However at >100eur per person and 3 hours of dinner i dont think this place is worth it. The worst though was the disgusting smell in the outdoor terrace coming from nearby trash bins. Nigiris wich are the star dish were not compact enough and would crumble into pieces. Service was below average. People tell me the experience at the bar is much better."
ChIJ79n37fEoQg0Rzi7HDdd8pwQ,5,Just amazing! One of the best Omakase in Madrid. Make sure to pair the food with the recommended wine set.
ChIJ79n37fEoQg0Rzi7HDdd8pwQ,5,"Definitely one of the best omakase experiences I have ever been! The chef needs to be proud of the high quality of fish he serves!! The tuna flight (Tuna, O-Toro and Toro) was the best part of the experience, you could feel the high quality of the fish."
ChIJS7709-ooQg0RHBMhM1M3yaA,5,"Musts: Tiradito A la Crema de
Aj√≠ Amarillo, Gunkan de
Huevo Trufado y Nigiri-hamburguesa de wagyu, rocoto y queso azul

A unique fusion of Peruvian, Japanese, and Asturian cuisines. The menu features modern tapas such as gyozas, baos, tiraditos, and a variety of sushi, including rolls and gunkans. The restaurant has received praise for its innovative dishes and attentive service. However, some diners have noted that certain items, like the ceviche and sushi, did not meet their expectations. Overall, Ronda 14 provides a distinctive dining experience that appeals to those interested in fusion cuisine."
ChIJS7709-ooQg0RHBMhM1M3yaA,5,"What a lovely find. My husband and I were trying to find a place to eat near our hotel and we chanced upon Ronda14. Service was warm and sincere. He took the time to explain everything to us in English because we couldn't understand Spanish. He was patient and not pushy at all. And the food was fusion goodness. I completely get it. Peruvian Japanese? We need more of this combination in the world!!! Whoever came up with the menu truly understands flavors. Fresh ingredients, delightful combinations, a clever confluence of traditional and modernity. I will be back!"
ChIJS7709-ooQg0RHBMhM1M3yaA,5,"This place made me smile! Beautifully balancing between laid-back and upscale, their cooking is great and you can tell they use quality ingredients. If I were to make one remark - I would keep the favours simpler, so that the main elements stand out! Great presentation and space decor."
ChIJS7709-ooQg0RHBMhM1M3yaA,2,Definitely not a Peruvian fusion restaurant that I would go back.  The sushi roll was only acceptable.  The tuna used in the spicy tuna roll was not of top quality as it didn‚Äôt taste so fresh.  The rice in the sushi roll was so mushy and soft.  The gyozas are not made in a traditional way.  It‚Äôs fried and then filled with some sauce on top.  The sauce is quite refreshing.  I highly recommend the pulled pork bao.  The duck bao was so regular and gave no surprise.  The ceviche was only acceptable as I don‚Äôt think the fish was super fresh.    The temperature that the ceviche was served was too warm.  It‚Äôs a middle price restaurant and perhaps you get what you pay for.
ChIJS7709-ooQg0RHBMhM1M3yaA,5,"Great drinks and good Peruvian food, perfect for an after-work (or class) happy hour or nice but relaxed dinner.

---

My wife and I live close by, and I have wanted to check out this restaurant since moving here as I love Peruvian cuisine and good sushi.

Service is friendly. If you want to eat in the dining room you need a reservation, otherwise there are enough tables out front to either drink or eat. The atmosphere is simple but very nice, and good for a relaxed after-work happy hour drink or nice but not 'fancy' dinner.

I started with Pisco Sour that was phenomenal (and appreciate they asked how strong I wanted it). My wife's house wine was very nice as well. For food we got baos, pork gyoza, and half a crab curry sushi roll. The food is all of very good quality and rich with flavors. The bao was probably my favorite this night, as the gyoza was quite rich for me. The sushi was certainly good albeit a bit pricey (19 euros per roll) - I would still try other rolls when I return.

Overall a great experience, and I will certainly be returning again."

ChIJp4YPH88oQg0RLvEnTtLh9wI,1,"Other than the amazing view, this hotel was an utter disappointment.

For a 5-star property, we expected outstanding service and top-tier amenities, but this hotel failed on both fronts. Upon check-in, we were told our room wasn‚Äôt ready, However, we were then told we could pay ‚Ç¨50 for early check-in, even though the hotel wasn‚Äôt busy and rooms were clearly available. This felt like an unfair money grab, especially for a 5-star establishment.

Friday evening, we went to the bar around 9pm, only to be told no cocktails were being served. We then tried the rooftop bar, but despite it being half-empty, we were turned away because they were ""only taking dinner reservations.""

Throughout our stay, we dealt with ongoing issues. The air conditioning didn‚Äôt work for most of the trip, and despite maintenance looking at it and offering a room change, no one followed up. Our TV also stopped working and had to be fixed. On our final day, the shower released brown water, leaving us unable to shower or even brush our teeth.

While the staff refunded our early check-in fee as an apology, it was too little, too late. We were so frustrated by the lack of care and follow-through that we just wanted to leave. This hotel is far from the 5-star experience it promises, and I would not recommend it to anyone visiting Madrid"
ChIJp4YPH88oQg0RLvEnTtLh9wI,5,"Hello my Name is Florian,

I Stay 4 Nights in the Hotel, 3 Nights in the Standard Room and One Night Junior Suite.
It was a great time and the room the standard room in the 7 floor with the Cinema Screen was greatful. The Junior Suite Zaha  Hadid on floor 1 was also wonderful.
A big Thanks goes out to trainee √Ålvaro on the Rezeption, it was such a good guy and helps us a lot, give him a promotion!"
ChIJp4YPH88oQg0RLvEnTtLh9wI,3,"Rooms are stylish, with different themes per floor. However, these rooms are not functional and lack practical space, we were on the first floor. The carpets were stained, there was a crack on the bed structure and we also had to change rooms on day one because our door wouldn't shut, big security issue. The air-conditioning/heating is slow in adapting to chosen temperatures, but maybe we didn't know how to use it properly. Staff is globally friendly but extremely condescending and unhelpful considering this a 5 star hotel. I would recommend staying in a 4 star closer to the centre. It's about 40min trip to Sol by metro."
ChIJp4YPH88oQg0RLvEnTtLh9wI,4,"The rooms are nice.
The breakfast is also very good.
The receptionist are great.
BUT  I left the ‚Äú do not disturb‚Äù sign at the door, but after i came back to the room 5-6 hours later, the cleaning service was inside ignoring the sign.
I did a reservation for a table for 4 at the 1st floor restaurant to have a dinner, it was at 21:30, at 21:50 after 3 workers did a 180 turn after they laugh  because we tell them that we can‚Äôt speak spanish, and we can communicate in english, we finally could place an order..
Thanks God that they have an experienced lady here, also not a very good  english speaker  but we managed to finish the order."
ChIJp4YPH88oQg0RLvEnTtLh9wI,1,"Rooms were large, but the main on/off switch doesn‚Äôt turn off all lights in the room. Only two bottles of water at check-in and no more free water afterwards. Honestly this is at most a 3-4 star hotel. Nothing here makes it five stars. TV is old, room ventilation is very bad. Very bad location for travelers and the area looks dangerous. The rooms don‚Äôt look like what they posted on their website at all. Room cleaning came in even with do not disturb sign hung at the door. Room service spoke very poor English. Money wasted, I should‚Äôve just picked four seasons or something"
ChIJAQAAANsoQg0RLpzeyYkJCCw,5,"The food was incredibly delicious, and the staff was wonderfully attentive and friendly. The ambiance added to the overall great experience.

ChIJAQAAANsoQg0RLpzeyYkJCCw,5,"Such a nice gem in a quiet neighbourhood. They have good meet and octopus, but my favourite was the scallops, and pimientos de padron"
ChIJAQAAANsoQg0RLpzeyYkJCCw,5,"One of the best dinners I‚Äôve had in Madrid! Cool tavern inside and very nice service. The food was amazing! We had scallops, mussels, grilled veggies, the cheese platter, 2 meats on the stone, and the baked hake. We also had the Galician drink at the end which was the coolest experience! You can‚Äôt go wrong here."
ChIJAQAAANsoQg0RLpzeyYkJCCw,4,"The atmosphere was good. Service? - OK, food? - not bad. I was expecting something more especially  octopus but the reality not matching with the photo. Take the meat, it worth  it üëçüèº"
ChIJAQAAANsoQg0RLpzeyYkJCCw,5,"Excellent food and service, their beef on a very hot stone is one of a kind experience, but you can also try some traditional dishes from Spain and Galice. You cannot go wrong with anything on their menu. My compliments to their cookers, waiters and management."
ChIJR5VG5cYoQg0RnyJgS2zvIk8,5,"My FAVOURITE restaurant in Madrid, been here several times. The seafood was very fresh and the personnel were very friendly and welcoming. Very close to where I live, in a quiet neighborhood, highly recommend coming. The sangria was very good!"

I am of course joking- I am both a tourist and an undesirable.

This place is properly astounding. Spanish food, impeccably made and presented, the most professional waiters in the city‚Ä¶ for a truly traditional Spanish dining experience THIS is the place to come.

Wine, 3-4 dishes each, and an aperativo for ‚Ç¨70 per head inc 10% tip.
Not cheap, but absolutely spectacular, and worth EVERY penny."
ChIJR5VG5cYoQg0RnyJgS2zvIk8,3,"A classic and seafood oriented restaurant that serves high quality fish. The service however lets this place down, making the dining experience below average."
ChIJR5VG5cYoQg0RnyJgS2zvIk8,2,"Below average and too expensive for the value.
The tuna tartar was freezing, had a ton soya sauce and wasn‚Äôt fresh. The zamburi√±as had too much sauce (you couldn‚Äôt feel the taste).
The cheesecake wasn‚Äôt great either‚Ä¶
The only thing we enjoyed was the meat, which was well cooked and good quality.

I recommend anyone come by try the fresh pasta is tasty drinks and delicious dessert.
ChIJ9QZ-P78oQg0Rmj7lTs2s1vs,4,Pizza is a bit thin and dry. They bring cappuccino sprayed with cocoa without asking.

ChIJfdAmoc8oQg0R9X8jNt_woVc,2,Very basic and poor quality pub food. Server may insist you pay multiple times for every drink rather than give you a bill at the end. Creates a very bad experience. If you HAVE to go to an Irish bar‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very average. However 19/20 places will serve better food/drinks and offer a much more gracious service
ChIJfdAmoc8oQg0R9X8jNt_woVc,5,"The best place to grab a beer with friends on a Friday.

Great for sitting down with a group, watching a game, or playing darts and billiards."
ChIJfdAmoc8oQg0R9X8jNt_woVc,5,"Most times 8/10 they pour a decent pint of Guinness, not rushed and with a nice head.

They have a pool table and electronic dart board, food is what to expect so I wouldn't suggest eating here, and the decor of the place is definitely very pub-like and cozy."

ChIJiVIpjsAoQg0Rd3ph4qOnMjg,3,"This place is great for brunch! It was 20 euros for a latte, chia pudding, and a main. I am assuming that the other mains tasted good because I got the chicken and waffles and it was terrible. I could not finish it. It made me so sad because I LOVE WAFFLES, but the waffles was way too sweet and tasted very artificially vanilla. The texture was stale and the fried chicken on top was kind of Asian? Almost like sweet and sour. I had a lovely experience and I LOVED the pink latte but PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! My friend ordered the shakshuka and liked it so maybe go with that."
ChIJiVIpjsAoQg0Rd3ph4qOnMjg,5,Came in for coffee. Service was good and coffee was delicious. They seem to have great brunch options . It‚Äôs cozy and nicely decorated .
ChIJiVIpjsAoQg0Rd3ph4qOnMjg,2,"I don't know why this place is popular...

Let's start with the service. There were enough waiters to be attentive to the customers. Around 15 minutes it took to take our order, and the treatment was horrifying. All hectic all the time, throwing the plates and interrupting while asking the order.

Then, the place is so small, that you will never be comfortable. So expect being bumped by people passing by you or with other chairs behind you.

And last, the food. Let's start with the menu:
How is it that they offer you two ""brunch menus"" so if you don't want that amount of food, you have to take it either way because at the end the price won't change.

Then, we ordered the shashuka and roast beef sandwich. They were OK, but forget to actually taste the roast beef as they paired it up with a strong taste bread and sauce, which made the taste of the roast beef to disappeared. We also had the nutella waffle, but we were so desperate to leave that I forgot yo take a picture to it.

Overall, disappointment... The name of the restaurant it's actually very appropriate for the experience: Bendita Locura..."
ChIJiVIpjsAoQg0Rd3ph4qOnMjg,5,We went to have Brunch and we were served by Raquel. She was super attentive and gave good recommendations! The Green Master smoothie is a must. A great place for brunch with a price that is very reasonable. I highly recommend for any brunch lover in Madrid.
ChIJiVIpjsAoQg0Rd3ph4qOnMjg,5,"Went for the Classic as it was more choices and value for money. Basically, gained the juice and the French toast for ‚Ç¨5 more. That said, it was more than I could handle alone and it would have been good to go with company to share.

The server was helpful pulling up an English menu on her phone as I was struggling with connection.

I particularly enjoyed that they used onsen tamago (slow cooked eggs Japanese way) instead of poached egg for the eggs benedict. Unexpected and it worked well."
ChIJP9psGsAoQg0RQomxJW7Y0TE,5,"Nice customers

ChIJRyrGasEoQg0RIg4KDaFOLGs,3,The pizza is a bit dry and needs more sauce on it. The wings are good but small and they don't have the classic buffalo sauce. But the attendant resolved an issue in a fast and friendly manner.
ChIJRyrGasEoQg0RIg4KDaFOLGs,2,This girl is too bad. She has no maners...  She Don't know how to speak. She dont know how too gave recpect...there food is soo good but her behaviour too much bad...
ChIJRyrGasEoQg0RIg4KDaFOLGs,1,"Absolutely vile! I have never eaten more dry pizzas. All the six pizzas we had were terrible, I can‚Äôt even believe how bad they were. And the garlic sauce was disgusting. Only good was the pepper. So sad."
ChIJRyrGasEoQg0RIg4KDaFOLGs,4,First time in trying Papa John s and I was quite surprised. Pizzas are big and cheap. Bye bye telepizza
ChIJRyrGasEoQg0RIg4KDaFOLGs,4,"I mean....it's Papa John's, just in Spain.  Pretty much exactly the same as in the US...down to the random pepper in box and garlic sauce.  Of course you can straight up order beer at pizza franchises over here so there is that.  Service is good....nice enough staff and easy to order online for pickup or delivery.  There are only three locations in Madrid if I'm not mistaken, and  they are fairly new."
ChIJx2bUDsEoQg0RPMGo5itVPh8,4,"English: great place to get a big sandwich for a good price. Staff speaks English. Not the best quality in the world, but size for the price. Menu available with a cookie and drink with free refills. Vegetarian options and vegan options are available.
Taste is decent and staff is friendly. The inside area is nice and big enough for a big group. You can also study here, although there is music playing in the background."
ChIJx2bUDsEoQg0RPMGo5itVPh8,5,"Great service‚Ä¶ to cooperative staff
And fresh food
Thanks titi"
ChIJx2bUDsEoQg0RPMGo5itVPh8,4,"I‚Äôm not entirely sure on how to go about reviewing a Subway‚Ä¶ The ‚Äúfast‚Äù food restaurant, that is. Not the form of transportation (Although, that might be even weirder).
In case you have no idea what they‚Äôre like, it‚Äôs an American chain which serves foot-long sandwiches (subs) or half of them if you‚Äôre not particularly hungry. They also have salads and delicious delicious cookies.
I‚Äôve tried a lot their subs, and I haven‚Äôt really been met with any unpleasant surprises taste-wise or the likes. The staff can make the experience less pleasant, though in this particular restaurant, they‚Äôre very friendly and I‚Äôve had no problems with them.
Anyway, after you‚Äôve picked your meats (or have chosen no to), you pick between two or three types of cheese and select from a variety of vegetables. You have a few extras and can even double your meat (which might not work if you ordered none) or your serving of cheese.
Then come the different sauces and dressings and whatnot, to be followed by the choice of a set meal, with chips or cookies (or man, those cookies‚Ä¶) and a drink. Fun fact: Here in Spain (and most of Europe) you can have a beer with your Sub.
You can then eat in or get out‚Ä¶ Not sure I can help you decide on this, though.
All in all, a good place for a quick and cheap bite on-the-go. Do try it if you haven‚Äôt already."
ChIJx2bUDsEoQg0RPMGo5itVPh8,3,I will have to give 3 stars only. The food is standard which is what I expected but the staff does not listen to your order carefully. For e.g. I wanted an oregano bread but I received an oats bread

ChIJqdvlT8IoQg0RnUfSJyI24MI,4,"Waitress was great, she spoke english also. Though there was only one person serving.

Food was also great, but a little expensive for the portion size.

But the biggest downfall was that the tables are all high and you have to sit on bar stools.

I would definitely visit this again.
I recommend reserving a table.

The main reason I visited this restaurant is the chocolate souffl√©! And it did not disappoint."
ChIJqdvlT8IoQg0RnUfSJyI24MI,4,Amazing mexican food! The best margaritas I‚Äôve ever taste in Madrid! Also the ‚Äúcochinita‚Äù tacos are awesome! I totally recommend this place!

ChIJc_WoXL0pQg0Rk575wcU8nZQ,5,"One of our favourite places in Madrid. Fell in love with French cuisine after the first time here, despite Paris had not surprised us with French food. Did not expect to find out great flavours and colours of French cuisine here. Great spot."
ChIJc_WoXL0pQg0Rk575wcU8nZQ,5,"Hidden gem. This exquisite reasonably priced french restaurant sits in a hard to notice enclave on a quiet street close to avenida de america.

ChIJc_WoXL0pQg0Rk575wcU8nZQ,5,"Been living in the area and came by chance. It is a little hard to find on a side street but definitely worth it, definitely a hidden gem. The food is amazing and the restaurant really pretty. They have an amazing terrace as well. The staff all very friendly."

ChIJsaZWmMYoQg0Rg54gMrzFPy4,5,I've become a regular of this place in 2021. Their terrace is great and always well heated and the food's  good too. The staff is great and Mabel has always been amazing to all my friends as well.
ChIJsaZWmMYoQg0Rg54gMrzFPy4,4,"The place looks nice in general and the staff was kind. The terrace looks fantastic until you've sat for a while and feel how the floor actually moves every time a person passes by (could be a waiter, fellow customers, etc). It would be the main downside"

ChIJG1mmVkUpQg0Rr50nRIicBQE,4,Really great quality Japanese with low affordable prices! We were a group of 12 people so we got our own section which was nice. Good quick service too!
ChIJG1mmVkUpQg0Rr50nRIicBQE,1,"Chinese restaurant serving Japanese inspired food (restaurante chino que sirve comida de inspiraci√≥n japonesa). It wasn't good. The menu posters, with a thousand different food options, stuck on the outside wall already gave me a hint to what was expecting us inside. The place was a mess, the waitress was so loud you couldn't ignore her, and the food was just appalling. Friend and I shared a bowl of limp, microwaved soy beans (how can anyone get soy beans wrong?), the seafood ramen I ordered had a pungent fishy smell and the noodles, well they were simply instant noodles, the type you buy in a packet (for 30 cents a pop) to which you add a pint of boiling water. My friend's yaki sobas weren't any better: they looked gloopy, bloated, and uninviting. And my friend confirmed as much. Enough said."
ChIJG1mmVkUpQg0Rr50nRIicBQE,2,The Ramen was very bad. Couldn‚Äôt even finish it. The fried rice was meh. Too oily. The service is great and they have those Japanese style huts that people love.
ChIJZXxwWsAoQg0RNyrF_07-CAw,5,"This looks like a regular eatery in the neighborhood. While they may not speak much English, there was a friendly man armed with Google Translate! Had a Pollo Asados that left me wanting more. Recommended for a quick and simple meal in the area"
ChIJZXxwWsAoQg0RNyrF_07-CAw,5,"Local breakfast feeling, nice location

Nice hot toast, Spanish omelette

I would love to try Salmon toast but unfortunately they didn‚Äôt have.

People there can‚Äôt communicate in English but they‚Äôre friendly, Prepare your basic Spanish or Google translate, it‚Äôs gonna be a bit difficult to customize your order but overall I love this place :)"
ChIJZXxwWsAoQg0RNyrF_07-CAw,5,"Everything was fantastic.
I am a fan of garbanzos and it was delicious. The grilled fish was perfect, fresh, grilled skillfully, very tasty!
Of course white wine was delicious too"
ChIJZXxwWsAoQg0RNyrF_07-CAw,5,The fish is always fresh and perfectly grilled. Everything I have eaten has always been tasty. The service is great.
ChIJZXxwWsAoQg0RNyrF_07-CAw,5,"Tiny place,  loved by the locals and great service. Breakfast prices are very competitive."
ChIJ6XzzpWQoQg0R-42Xxxz_cwI,5,"This place stays open till 11pm which is great for a late night snack. I didn't try the pizzas on their menu, just a couple of slices of jamon /ham pizza. It was delicious. Soft and melty cheese on top and a delicate crunchy crust below. Perfect."
ChIJ6XzzpWQoQg0R-42Xxxz_cwI,5,"Best pizza in Madrid
I'm a pizza maker.
Eaten pizza in Roma, Napoli, NYcity etc
I've been searching for 5 years for an authentic Italian PIZZA.
This is the best pizza I've eaten in SPAIN.
(Of course, I haven't eaten at ever pizza restaurant that exist in Spain)"
ChIJ6XzzpWQoQg0R-42Xxxz_cwI,5,"Delicious, authentic (a rarity here), freshly made pizzas. A good deal with the lunch menu and the Italian guy who runs the place is a great guy. 100%recommended."
ChIJ6XzzpWQoQg0R-42Xxxz_cwI,5,"Real Margarita pizza! quick , good taste and friendly service"

ChIJp8AftsAoQg0Rf_U2Yniw4Vk,5,"I recently dined at Frontall87 and it was a great experience! The food was absolutely delicious, capturing the authentic flavors of Spain. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. The staff was attentive and friendly, especially a very nice waitress wearing a Halloween costume. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a taste of Spain right in our own city. A true culinary delight!"
ChIJp8AftsAoQg0Rf_U2Yniw4Vk,5,"Such good food, very local vibe, and great prices! Highly recommend for a full lunch including an appetizer, main dish and dessert for ‚Ç¨15, and had leftovers."
ChIJp8AftsAoQg0Rf_U2Yniw4Vk,5,"Solid, attentive staff that  looks happy to serve you. Tortilla doesn't lie if you're into poco hecho. Montados are on point.. from lomo+queso, morcilla to pollo/tomate.  Worth coming if in the neighborhood."
ChIJp8AftsAoQg0Rf_U2Yniw4Vk,5,"The BEST tortilla in all of Madrid, I‚Äôve lived here for more than a decade. Try the truffle or goat cheese or even just a slice of the plain tortilla, you will love it!"
ChIJp8AftsAoQg0Rf_U2Yniw4Vk,5,"I am really surprised with the food  quality and the service of this little hidden restaurant. Homemade food made from scratch and lovely presented. My congratulations to Jose Manuel, owner and chef. I can say that he knows what clients need. Yaki the waitress, a lovely lady who loked after us and advised us on the menu. We will be back again."
ChIJ2yWTIMMoQg0RZU_TNlJxYzM,5,"I‚Äôve came here twice, and the experience was very nice both of the times.
I advise you to go early or to book a table as the place is frequently packed üò•

The food is really nice and the service is fast.
Happy to return"
ChIJ2yWTIMMoQg0RZU_TNlJxYzM,5,"Alejandro was the most pleasant waiter, who made our evening. Great food, great experience. I‚Äôll come back!"
ChIJ2yWTIMMoQg0RZU_TNlJxYzM,4,"Came here for lunch without a reservation and arrived before 2pm, almost didn‚Äôt get a table, so I advice you to come early. Atmosphere and food is great, classic place."
ChIJ2yWTIMMoQg0RZU_TNlJxYzM,5,A very typical spanish taberna. Very good food and nice service. We ordered a couple of things to share and everything was very good.
ChIJ2yWTIMMoQg0RZU_TNlJxYzM,5,Nice place for eating daily menu and having a extra big breakfast
ChIJIeqopsIoQg0RAqVop8J-_-Q,4,"Excellent restaurant.

The food was delicious.
I think it is the first time I had such a succulent foie gras outside of France.
The solomillo was extraordinary.
The royal melosa de ternera was excellent, although the sauce was a bit salty for my taste.
Desserts were amazing.
Wine was excellent. But take an eternity to choose the wine because the wine menu was as long as a novel.
The only regret I had is that there is no cheese plate on the menu.

Service was good, maybe a bit pushy to consume water."
ChIJIeqopsIoQg0RAqVop8J-_-Q,5,This is one of the best restaurant in Madrid. The food was great and the service excellent. Use the knowledge of the wine sommelier to get the best pairing with the food.
ChIJIeqopsIoQg0RAqVop8J-_-Q,5,"One of the traditional good restaurants in Madrid out of the new trendy group of restaurants. Service is perfect, one of the few stills calling you by ""se√±or"". Quality of the food brutal, ham awesome. Very good carta de vinos."
ChIJIeqopsIoQg0RAqVop8J-_-Q,4,"Fantastic food and environmental place, we seated outside, in the terrace, the service very good, the price was round 60‚Ç¨ per person"
ChIJIeqopsIoQg0RAqVop8J-_-Q,4,"Very good food, traditional menu, excellent service."
ChIJx1B8ocIoQg0Ryl1bTZJAXWE,4,Restaurant with a modern and cool appearance but that does not neglect its cuisine. In its menu you can find dishes that will satisfy all tastes. The two times I have gone to dinner with friends everything was always very good. Perfect place to have dinner and then continue having a drink. It caught my attention that the mineral water is bottled for them under their own brand. The only negative is that the chairs can be uncomfortable if you are a little tall.
ChIJx1B8ocIoQg0Ryl1bTZJAXWE,5,"Very fashionable decoration at a very reasonable price, about 40-50 euros per head. The food was delicious, especially the oxtail risotto, very good. And on top of that, the kitchen is open all afternoon so I can take my foreign clients to eat at seven in the afternoon and be at home at ten. Of course, the waiters are quite inexperienced but they are eager and very nice.
I will definitely go often."
ChIJx1B8ocIoQg0Ryl1bTZJAXWE,2,"This restaurant is located on the famous Vel√°zquez street but at number 150, at a height quite far from the best-known area of ‚Äã‚Äãsaid street.
Its decoration is impeccable and cared for. Pastel tones and small tables and fireplaces.
Your letter is normal. There are no complicated dishes. Two of us went for dinner and we ordered two starters and a main to share. The portion of jerky was exaggerated, a lot of it and very poorly cut. Another dish was some Vietnamese rolls that were delicious but in this case the portion was very small. And as a main course we ordered charcoal tuna. They were two huge pieces of tuna, the presentation was quite regular as was its preparation. We ordered it medium rare but due to the size of the pieces it was very toasted on the outside and too raw on the inside.
With a bottle of wine and without dessert the price was 50 per head. A high price for the food it was."
ChIJx1B8ocIoQg0Ryl1bTZJAXWE,4,"I really liked their style, and the look they have given to the renewed Nodo. The kitchen is very neat. Well made and decorated dishes! A very nice terrace, one of the few that is well maintained, and that does not have too many buildings around it. Very differentiated areas, and even an area for women!!! all in pink. You can have breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner, any time is good to be there. Tables at the entrance in fun shapes that allow a group to be comfortable and at the same time be able to chat well. Prices according to a careful kitchen and a modern and different design. To go!!"
ChIJx1B8ocIoQg0Ryl1bTZJAXWE,4,"Perfect place for dinner as a couple or with friends.
If you are lucky enough to enjoy its interior garden you can consider yourself privileged since there are a lot of challenges to get a table.
The food is quite good, it is better to take advice since they always surprise you."
ChIJYUbxEMAoQg0R2TaRfb_5Q3k,5,Nice food with great ambience
ChIJYUbxEMAoQg0R2TaRfb_5Q3k,1,"They have SMALLER sandwiches then the other Rodilla in the city ..is this normal ??
I was very disappointed to see it‚Äôs half of the size I normally pay for the SAME MONEY"
ChIJYUbxEMAoQg0R2TaRfb_5Q3k,5,"Great place to have a quick breakfast. Simple menu, mostly sandwiches."
ChIJYUbxEMAoQg0R2TaRfb_5Q3k,1,The salami was more expired than joe biden
ChIJYUbxEMAoQg0R2TaRfb_5Q3k,4,Good chai latte and mini brownies
ChIJ____P8AoQg0RiFsKocnrni8,3,Literally just a better option to traditional fast food chains. They have a great selection of cold sandwiches and sweet pastries... The price is fare.
ChIJ____P8AoQg0RiFsKocnrni8,5,"The lady who served us breakfast was nice ,her collegue a little less"
ChIJ____P8AoQg0RiFsKocnrni8,4,Typical Spanish caff√© place where you can find all what you need to drill and eat
ChIJ____P8AoQg0RiFsKocnrni8,5,Best sandwiches made everyday. Fresh ingredients
ChIJ____P8AoQg0RiFsKocnrni8,3,"Nothing special, but a good place for a quick sandwich or a salad."
ChIJ7UfOANEoQg0RoIZ4gzNq_Ow,1,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU‚ÄôRE A TOURIST BECAUSE THEY WILL SCAM YOU!

I ordered two boccadillos (calamari and pig ear), and they instead served and charged me for the main versions of both of them (and extra for bread when I had wanted the boccadillo). And then gaslit me when I pointed out that I didn‚Äôt get what I had ordered (I literally pointed at the menu so it wasn‚Äôt a language mistake), why would I have even ordered two mains for myself?

The pig ear was so salty and fatty I could barely eat any of it."
ChIJ7UfOANEoQg0RoIZ4gzNq_Ow,3,The service was great! The waitress who served us was caring and courteous. However the place smelled strongly of bleach that it was such a bad experience to eat in the restaurant. The servings were very generous and well priced. But the food was ordinary.
ChIJ7UfOANEoQg0RoIZ4gzNq_Ow,5,"Situated in the North-East outskirts of Madrid core, Los Torreznos offers a delightful culinary experience that embodies Spanish hospitality. From the moment you step inside, the friendly atmosphere created by the welcoming staff makes you feel right at home. The bar is renowned for its exceptional seafood, with fresh and high-quality ingredients that highlight the rich flavors of the sea in every dish.

In addition to their seafood, the impressive selection of delicious tapas pairs perfectly with their excellent local cerveza. This hidden gem offers a cozy ambiance, mouth-watering seafood, and a fantastic variety of tapas, making it a must-visit spot for both locals and visitors seeking an authentic taste of Spain."
ChIJ7UfOANEoQg0RoIZ4gzNq_Ow,4,"Good location, the pork is nice but tooooo salty. And the waiter seems not know English very much, so you need to know how to order and what to order before you go. Generally a good restaurant."
ChIJ7UfOANEoQg0RoIZ4gzNq_Ow,5,"On vacation, staying in a nearby hotel. I visited this establishment several times. The food was home comfort style. Staff were attentive, friendly and pleasant. Great relaxing atmosphere."
ChIJywkAEGUoQg0Rh0iHAKz2Q60,5,"Enjoyed fresh seafood, the prices reasonable, the atmosphere serene, the service excellent, the wine list extensive, the food absolutely delicious! I loved it Erica our server had a friendly disposition, was knowledge, and courteous. The location is new, I recommend them, do check them out!!"
ChIJywkAEGUoQg0Rh0iHAKz2Q60,5,Amazing food and friendly staff. Super fresh and expertly cooked. Thank you!!
ChIJywkAEGUoQg0Rh0iHAKz2Q60,5,"I dont love seafood so much but here I ate a lot! It was really tasty, huge portions (it literally came in the shape of a boat). The service 100% and the place is really really big. Dont forget to make a reservation just in case!"
ChIJywkAEGUoQg0Rh0iHAKz2Q60,4,Always recommend this restaurant. Good staff and delicious sea food!
ChIJywkAEGUoQg0Rh0iHAKz2Q60,5,Best seafood in madrid !! Great selection of wine and very friendly staff. We had ‚Äòarroz con bogavante‚Äù best choice ever ! Definitely coming back üòä
ChIJq8AIh8koQg0R8FcKl1Q6Br4,5,"Big family lunch. Wr ordered to share. My favorite thing was Gambas al Ajillo( incredible) and the mix fritos.The octopus, huevo rotos, and steak  were very good as well. We reserved a table outside, and the weather was perfect.The service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and kind."
ChIJq8AIh8koQg0R8FcKl1Q6Br4,4,"Good restaurant. Very nice people working here. It started great with the appetizers. I ordered the pulpo to start which was really great but a bit under salted. My entr√©e was turbot with shrimp in a garlic sauce. Although it was fresh ingredients and flavors, it was slightly lacking. The potatoes and green beans were NOT seasoned and the fish could‚Äôve used more garlic. Service was good but not overly attentive and it took some effort to get attention a couple times (I was early so the only one in the dining room). It may be slightly pricey for what it is compared to other restaurants in the area but overall it was still a very nice dinner and I would eat here again so I would definitely recommend it."
ChIJq8AIh8koQg0R8FcKl1Q6Br4,5,"I ordered hake grilled with garlic, which wasn't on the menu but they made it for me on request. The hake was delicious and perfectly cooked. I also ordered the tomato salad (fresca), which was terrific. The sweet and sour tomatoes were combined with mini  gherkins, preserved tuna, olive oil, and red onion"
ChIJq8AIh8koQg0R8FcKl1Q6Br4,5,One of the best typical Spanish restaurants in Madrid with a more than great service. Their fish is always more than Jummie
ChIJq8AIh8koQg0R8FcKl1Q6Br4,5,"Classic Spanish restaurant with classic Spanish cousine. They offer variety of meat and sea food. I would recommend chuletitas (lamb), almehas marinera (fried fish and shrimp) and tomato salad. They are all delicious.

The area is not turistic but waitress was able to speak very well. After the dinner they offer coffee and mint liqourwith same candy."
ChIJ--n7_NsoQg0RK514XbTAru8,5,"Quite simply my favorite restaurant in Madrid, and hands down the best quality/price ratio I've EVER seen.

I don't know why it's taken me so long to write a review, as I've been coming for years (and will continue to do so). The food is fantastic, they regularly change the menu, and the friendly owner Jaime can answer any question you have about anything on the menu, wine pairings, etc., in Spanish and in English. Almost everything can be ordered in full or half portions, so you can choose to try a bunch of different things on the extremely varied menu that expertly mixes traditional Spanish cuisine with Mexican, South American and even Asian influences.

Simply put, there's little reason to go anywhere else in the area (that is, unless The Market Madrid is all booked up!)."
ChIJ--n7_NsoQg0RK514XbTAru8,5,"Excellent service, fabulous food."
ChIJ--n7_NsoQg0RK514XbTAru8,5,"Wow, what a great meal! Tasty appetizers, really good mains and desserts from heaven! Must try the basil olive cake, as well as the traditional Shepard's breadcrumbs! Very friendly atmosphere and super nice owner! :) We hope to come back soon!"
ChIJ--n7_NsoQg0RK514XbTAru8,4,"Small but warm and friendly casual restaurant. The food was very, very delicious and how dishes arranged were professionally done. The recommended wines were from Castilla y Leon and both red and white wines were perfect (I had to take pictures of the bottle, since it was so nice!).
I would recommend to anybody who visit the area."
ChIJ--n7_NsoQg0RK514XbTAru8,4,A wonderful restaurant with homemade food and great service
ChIJnZm9b8goQg0R6iyLvDc762Y,5,"One single word, wow! You can get served in Spanish, English, and French! The food is great and service even better. Thank you, Benjamin!"
ChIJnZm9b8goQg0R6iyLvDc762Y,5,"Great place and food. We had patatas bravas, nachos (best choice), mozzarella sticks and croquetas. Everything was amazing!"
ChIJnZm9b8goQg0R6iyLvDc762Y,5,"Excellent burgers. Good beers. A very lively bar in a quiet area of the city. Fast, impeccable service and a warm welcome. A small piece of France in Madrid. And with the World Cup!"
ChIJnZm9b8goQg0R6iyLvDc762Y,4,What an excellent burger place!  Just in a quiet area in Madrid‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóüëå
ChIJnZm9b8goQg0R6iyLvDc762Y,5,"Can‚Äôt wait to be back in Madrid and of course visit this place one of my favorites. The burgers are wow 5 stars in general all food. Amazing staff.

ChIJV1TdXM4oQg0RW7yicSPzui0,5,Great kebab with a very friendly owner.
ChIJV1TdXM4oQg0RW7yicSPzui0,3,Very beautiful
ChIJV1TdXM4oQg0RW7yicSPzui0,5,"Very good cachopo! And delicious Kebap! Highly recommended! A lot of kindness, the most important thing!"
ChIJV1TdXM4oQg0RW7yicSPzui0,5,"I went to order takeout. The staff's attention was perfect. The order was prepared quickly and the food was good.
Very good quality price.
The place is small to eat there, but it is worth it"
ChIJV1TdXM4oQg0RW7yicSPzui0,1,"I went to the restaurant to place an order. They already had all the beef and chicken cut up. I have heard how they pointed out two orders and they have done as per my request, taking the cold beef with tongs and heating it in the microwave and the bread, however they did not heat the chicken. Incredible how in front of the customers it has not even been cut so as not to cut or heat the meat. I hope you don't buy anything here. How unpleasant everything is."
ChIJV1TdXM4oQg0RYJGcPatqpFw,5,"Apart from the kebab, they have this very delicious food called arroz chaufa. I recommend an excellent dish with a good quantity.
I will continue visiting the restaurant more often üòâ"
ChIJV1TdXM4oQg0RYJGcPatqpFw,5,"I went wanting to eat a kebad but I saw a sign that said arroz chaufa and lomo saltado and the presentation and flavor were delicious (100‚Ä¢\‚Ä¢ Peruvian flavor)
I would definitely repeat again
Very good attention"
ChIJV1TdXM4oQg0RYJGcPatqpFw,1,"Terrible service and they don't care about their customers. We ordered two pizzas and some calamari at 8:00 p.m. via Just Eat from this bar so that it arrived at 10:00 p.m. 11:00 pm arrives and the order has not arrived, we call and they tell us that they have canceled the order for their brown eggs and they do not notify, nor call, nor do they refund the money. On top of that we have to call Just Eat to complain. What they are being are textbook scammers."
ChIJV1TdXM4oQg0RYJGcPatqpFw,1,"The order arrived without sauce, despite having been told to put a lot of sauce; We called right away to let them know and after several minutes of conversation they said they were sending the sauce, after waiting 40 minutes we could finally eat, yes, all cold.
Also the durum didn't taste good, I had to throw away half of it."
ChIJV1TdXM4oQg0RYJGcPatqpFw,5,"We always order kebab from this place. It's great and never fails. The truth is that the kebab has a lot of sauce, the meat is good and a good quantity"
ChIJUysMx8coQg0R-rq4-sJ4FcU,1,"A real shame of a restaurant. I'm going to give you some advice, don't order food at home because it will never arrive. We are still waiting for ours, ordered more than 2 hours ago. Finally we had to cancel it and we were left without dinner."
ChIJUysMx8coQg0R-rq4-sJ4FcU,1,We ordered from this restaurant through Just Eat and the experience was embarrassing! It took more than an hour to bring us our order and the food was disastrous: short in both quantity and quality. The sauce on the nachos was ridiculous and I haven't had worse quesadillas in my life. I don't recommend it at all.
ChIJUysMx8coQg0R-rq4-sJ4FcU,1,"They offer food at home, but it takes 1 hour to send it for ""many orders"", they delivered the order incomplete, and they spend more than 1 hour bringing it, they don't even apologize or reward. I don't recommend it."
ChIJUysMx8coQg0R-rq4-sJ4FcU,1,"The owners of this restaurant changed their mobile number and the one you see here is not theirs, I would like to report it since now I have that number and I get tired of calling, thank you"
ChIJUysMx8coQg0R-rq4-sJ4FcU,1,
ChIJcYuvGcgoQg0RfN9LnCjIrQo,5,"If you love seafood and generally shrimps/langustines, this is the spot for you. Little bit out of city center, with reasonable price and defnitely packed with flavours. This spot isnt a fancy restaurant, but true local spot, which get filled very fast. With little bit of chaos, but owner has her own system and make sure, nobody is waiting hungry. Definitely recommended to visit!"
ChIJcYuvGcgoQg0RfN9LnCjIrQo,5,"I almost feel bad leaving this review, because this place is such a gem. It's very much a for locals, by locals kind of place - so if you don't speak Spanish, you may want to think twice before coming.

Otherwise, the ambiance is busy, the seating is uncomfortable, the service is slow - and the authenticity of the experience only adds to the absolutely phenomenal, fresh, dirt cheap seafood.

My back hurts, I ate way too much way too fast, and I enjoyed every second of it. Phenomenal experience."
ChIJcYuvGcgoQg0RfN9LnCjIrQo,4,"I like this cute little place and very local. The owner doesn‚Äôt speak English but friendly. Nothing special of the foods, they serve simple cuisine but taste good. Overall is nice, a bit pricey to be honest."
ChIJcYuvGcgoQg0RfN9LnCjIrQo,5,"Fantastically fresh seafood, prepared simply. Prices are very reasonable. Come in a group to taste everything! Practically a standing space only bar, which fills up almost immediately after opening. Come early!"
ChIJcYuvGcgoQg0RfN9LnCjIrQo,5,"The seafood at the restaurant was simply outstanding‚Äîfresh, flavorful, and perfectly prepared. The simplicity in the dishes allowed the natural taste to shine. Highly recommended for seafood lovers!"
ChIJHyU8HdAoQg0RkQXl4R6bZZ0,2,"We ordered biriyani, but it looked and tasted like something else. Cold drinks were stored inside the toilet area which was disgusting and we somehow ate food there"
ChIJHyU8HdAoQg0RkQXl4R6bZZ0,5,RESHMI KEBAB IS AWESOME. VERY FILLING
ChIJHyU8HdAoQg0RkQXl4R6bZZ0,1,"Very bad. To begin with, the cook is sweating, without a hat and does not wash his hands to prepare the food, untidy place. D√ºrum without sealing on the sides, valentino in a frying pan and not on a closed griddle as usual, cold and very salty meat heated for 2 minutes, the meat is very, very dry and tasteless, without a refrigerated area for food being at room temperature with a heat wave, I will not return again...."
ChIJHyU8HdAoQg0RkQXl4R6bZZ0,3,It was late and we looked for where they would give us dinner. Here we arrived and had dinner.
ChIJHyU8HdAoQg0RkQXl4R6bZZ0,5,"Apu kebabs is the best kebab place in
Unsurpassed Spain in addition to a perfect establishment and apart from the kebab everything is very good I recommend it to everyone"
ChIJqee5_p0pQg0R-gHP1i2ypYI,5,Nice cafe
ChIJqee5_p0pQg0R-gHP1i2ypYI,5,I like it !
ChIJqee5_p0pQg0R-gHP1i2ypYI,3,Ok
ChIJqee5_p0pQg0R-gHP1i2ypYI,5,"I needed to eat something quickly and I totally got it right.

A quiet, pleasant and very well attended place.

I ordered a third and a French omelet sandwich with tuna.

While I was waiting for them to do it, the waitress served me with some patatas bravas on a skewer. From the texture you could tell that the potatoes were quite overcooked but they tasted good.

Very delicious sandwich. Freshly made homemade omelet in a bread between baguette and ciabatta, crunchy and very rich in flavor.
Since I was in a hurry, I had to eat the last third of the sandwich on the way.

A quick and good lunch for ‚Ç¨8.20, a much cheaper price than the rest of the cafes in the area (they are very crazy with the prices in Parque de la Avenidas)

I will repeat for sure!!"
ChIJqee5_p0pQg0R-gHP1i2ypYI,2,"The girl who was there was nice. We ordered some patatas bravas, the minute you order them you hear the microwave blaring for 2/3 minutes and you receive a plate of reheated potatoes with a curious flavor. I would not repeat nor recommend anyone to go to an establishment that charges you 11.20 for some reheated potatoes and a 25cl Fanta."
ChIJQ0kH37coQg0RLuWWLhXatJ4,5,"We've eaten here several times, and everything is always fresh and delicious. The quality of the fish and avocado is excellent, and the chef has a light touch with sauces (unlike many ""trendy"" sushi places, which smother their dishes with mayonnaise, tempura, etc.) Service is fast and friendly, and prices are very reasonable."
ChIJQ0kH37coQg0RLuWWLhXatJ4,5,Really good
ChIJQ0kH37coQg0RLuWWLhXatJ4,5,"Quirky venue, wonderful welcoming owners and delicious fusion cuisine! More a Japanese than Peruvian, so not for purists, but highly recommended! Reservation an absolute must."
ChIJQ0kH37coQg0RLuWWLhXatJ4,5,"Incredible shushi-peruvian fusion @madrid!!! The cook is an awesome person, food is delicious and the place is original. 100% recommended!!"
ChIJQ0kH37coQg0RLuWWLhXatJ4,5,Amazing sushi fusion place inside the market. Perfect to take away or stay there in the middle of the market. One of the best I have tried
ChIJw4GsAcgoQg0RPOicCIDeRYE,4,"A small nice place, very crowded so don‚Äôt under estimate that you need a reservation. I liked the food served."
ChIJw4GsAcgoQg0RPOicCIDeRYE,5,"Me ha encantado, loved it! The food was very good at a normal price and the service was nice. I'd go again no doubt if I lived closer. But I recommend it 100%"
ChIJw4GsAcgoQg0RPOicCIDeRYE,5,One of my best tapas experience in Madrid.
ChIJw4GsAcgoQg0RPOicCIDeRYE,5,"First thing we do when we get to Madrid is going to La Guindalera!!. Taking my elderly sister, she never goes out but never said no to a meal in La Guindalera!!"
ChIJw4GsAcgoQg0RPOicCIDeRYE,5,Local place with excellent food - generously served - and service.

ChIJLc7mIs0oQg0RdVxVI2PODxM,5,The food was absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced. My work colleague and I chose around 10 different montaditos to try and each one was very tasty. Was early afternoon so only us in but I will definitely be going again before the end of my work trip
ChIJLc7mIs0oQg0RdVxVI2PODxM,5,Cozy place. The food is great. Owners are really nice. Great place for trying to relax.
ChIJLc7mIs0oQg0RdVxVI2PODxM,4,Very good quality prize ratio

ChIJLc7mIs0oQg0RdVxVI2PODxM,4,"A cozy, charming cafeteria-restaurant, with tables outside and an intimate atmosphere. The tortoise Reini is very nice and walks around so comfortable in his little house. They serve good El Criollo coffee. Pleasant. Correct customer service."
ChIJ51wEwrcoQg0Rap1RvoYgBXY,5,"One of the best places to have a nice heavy meal! Really friendly people, who have the best Indian curry and rice! This comes from a foodie and who's an Indian üòÑ
Do try the spicy sauce!"
ChIJ51wEwrcoQg0Rap1RvoYgBXY,5,"Good resturant , it open until late time . I try shawarma and kebab , and most important thing is halal"
ChIJ51wEwrcoQg0Rap1RvoYgBXY,4,"Definitely recommend for those seeking simple, affordable and Halal meal in Madrid"
ChIJ51wEwrcoQg0Rap1RvoYgBXY,5,"üëåüèºüíØ EXCEPTIONAL üí´
I never had a kebab ü•ô that I truly enjoyed before stumbling upon this restaurant on an evening walküòÖ

Everything I've eaten so far (Chicken kebabs, beef durumsüåØ, chicken biryaniüçõ and chicken samosas) was freshly prepared, properly seasoned and quite tasty! ü§§

P.S If you're a fan of spicyüå∂Ô∏è üî• like I am then I highly recommend paying the ‚Ç¨0.50 extra and trying their spicy sauce!!!!üòçüëåüèº It's nothing like Tabasco etc trash worthy ‚ùåüôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üóëÔ∏è

If you live close by I suggest calling the restaurant directly vs using Just Eat for üõµ üÜì delivery üòè"
ChIJ51wEwrcoQg0Rap1RvoYgBXY,5,"Fantastic dishes! I've eaten a lot of Turkish food in a lot of different places and I can safely say Tawakal makes their dishes as well as they can get. The Lamachuns and Doner kebabs are absolutely splendid. The owners are super chill too and very chatty. I recommend dropping by here, grabbing a sandwich, a beer and just enjoying some fresh, quality food and conversation.

I definitely plan on being a regular client :)"
ChIJp6A_C8coQg0RaKdu1CSPX8I,3,"Went for the buffet option. Despite the number of dishes, none of them really impressed us comparing with other buffets in Madrid.

The restaurant is big and well decorated with isolated tables which gives you more privacy.

The staff seem to be lost with so many tables to look after. The waiters pretty much throw the dishes at you on the table.

Would we go back or recommend this restaurant? üëé"
ChIJp6A_C8coQg0RaKdu1CSPX8I,2,"We had a terrible experience here. The service was poor, and the food suboptimal. We ordered meat dishes with rice, but ended up waiting over 40 minutes just for the rice! Despite repeatedly asking the staff for updates, we were left with cold food and no answers.
After waiting in 15-minute increments, we finally canceled our order. No one even bothered to apologize for the inconvenience or for spoiling what was meant to be a nice evening with visiting family.
Definitely avoid this place."
ChIJp6A_C8coQg0RaKdu1CSPX8I,3,"It‚Äòs a buffet a la cart. You can order a lot of food via your mobile phone. The restaurant is big and beautiful. The food was ok not very tasty but alright. The service at the entrance was very kind. When they serve the food they will literally throw the dish on ypur table. Overall it‚Äòs ok you can spend time there and casually order something to eat with your phone, wich is nice."
ChIJp6A_C8coQg0RaKdu1CSPX8I,1,"If you come here be prepared to wait over 30 minutes for every dish, they are understaffed and can't handle the volume of clients they're getting. I haven't been to a slower restaurant in my life. They make you feel like you don't exist.

ES: No veng√°is si no quer√©is esperar media hora entre cada plato.

They actually make the sushi and the rest of the food when you order it, but it still feels old and dull. You receive a QR code that you scan and can then order food from their menu website."
ChIJp6A_C8coQg0RaKdu1CSPX8I,5,"Amazing place! Very tasty buffet and very kind employees. I‚Äôm fan of buffets and I can tell that this one was the best! (2d place it‚Äôs sumo in Amsterdamü§≠ü´∂üèΩ)
I‚Äôll try to visit again before end of my trip in Madrid

I hope thy will not make it overpriced and definitely will come back at next trip"
ChIJe3Fhj80oQg0RHJ69ImMbomY,5,"Very nice place. Limited choice of food but all delicious. Open early in the morning and there is a separate breakfast menu (low prices, large quantity, good quality). Waiters mostly don‚Äôt speak English, but a few of them do. Delicious wine."
ChIJe3Fhj80oQg0RHJ69ImMbomY,3,"This is a nice, spacious and well decorated place, with a reasonable set menu for lunch (at ‚Ç¨12.90), but which some might find that is positioned more like a bar de copas than as a restaurant, with dance music playing and with food not so much at the center of the experience. Still, the beer is good and cold, the food is not bad and the atmosphere on a working day in Easter is pretty friendly. Service is fast and wants to be nice. Definitely an option for lunch in the area"
ChIJe3Fhj80oQg0RHJ69ImMbomY,5,We loved the ambience. The menu del d√≠a was great value for money ‚ò∫Ô∏è
ChIJe3Fhj80oQg0RHJ69ImMbomY,4,They have got some interesting dishes and okayish service. It's always super crowded and you need to reserve your table in advance. Nice Mediterranean ambient in a calm and residential neighborhood. I will probably go back.
ChIJe3Fhj80oQg0RHJ69ImMbomY,1,"Never in my life have I experienced such maltreatment. I am totally new to Madrid and was hoping to enjoy lunch with Family friends. As we approached the door, the waitress refused to seat us, as previously my friends had left a bad review. Very strange as this would have been the perfect opportunity for the restaurant to redeem themselves, however they chose pettiness and ill treatment as they sent away a 96 year old woman, in 32 degrees to eat somewhere else. Absolutely disgusted by the treatment. Luckily we went to a restaurant around the corner, that not only seated us but went out of their way to make sure our 96 year old granny was comfortable, safe and taken care of.

Please avoid this place, there are many beautiful people in Madrid and this place is a poor representation of fine dining and respect in this diverse city."

ChIJJXeXgscoQg0RK3-tnsZK2Sg,1,"Truly a Brothel King experience

Paid for my food with card on a glitchy touch machine, it didn‚Äôt register it and produced ‚Äúerror‚Äù even though it charged me. Told this to the manager who simply shrugged and left away. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. That woman should be fired to say the least. Had to pay again in cash for my order. The other fat male cashier demanded of me to ‚Äúspeak Spanish‚Äù when I complained about the manager. These ‚Äúpeople‚Äù are not just incompetent but ridiculous. Avoid this place like plague. 0/10"
ChIJJXeXgscoQg0RK3-tnsZK2Sg,4,"Clean facilities , fresh made Pommes and Burgers, good quality overall, If you dont know anything about where to go for having food this is your international way to go ;)"
ChIJJXeXgscoQg0RK3-tnsZK2Sg,2,Food was low quality; staff lazy to work or answer. Beverage machine was not functional for long time.
ChIJJXeXgscoQg0RK3-tnsZK2Sg,3,"Burger King is Burking everywhere, I really enjoy their burgers and shakes. What‚Äôs unique about this restaurant is that they have a take out window for pedestrians in the side street, really great when you are walking with your dogs and would like to get a snack. I‚Äôm fact recommend you do because the restaurant inside as far as tables and floors, not the cleanest. The rubbish bins were full to top and couldn‚Äôt even throw food away. Perhaps more cleaning in the dinning area is recommended."
ChIJc5-fErgoQg0RcjvE0XD3ToQ,5,"A great spot in Madrid for a quick breakfast‚Äîloved cappuccinos, perfectly flaky croissants, and the delicious pain au chocolat!"

ChIJc5-fErgoQg0RcjvE0XD3ToQ,4,"Good selection of products. Sandwiches were delicious! Very fresh food, a healthy snack.
Don't forget to check out the breakfast and lunch deals. Very good offers!
Good location, friendly staff and fast service. Would definitely recommend it.

ChIJc5-fErgoQg0RcjvE0XD3ToQ,5,Nice place to eat sandwiches and drinks.
ChIJc5-fErgoQg0RcjvE0XD3ToQ,5,This was the only place open on Sunday within walking distance from the bus station with free Wi-Fi. The surprise was it has great coffee. I had two cups while making reservations for a place to stay. The staff was great.
ChIJv7SrYrgoQg0R_vVlaROHbXs,5,"Relaxed and laid-back atmosphere.
Nothing too pretentious but the food was really good."

ChIJv7SrYrgoQg0R_vVlaROHbXs,5,Delicious
ChIJv7SrYrgoQg0R_vVlaROHbXs,5,"Classic tavern, bullfighting decoration. The service is impeccable, gentle and fast. The terrace is always full of people.  The kilo of red meat is highly recommended. Cheap, good and pretty. The terrace is always full because they are great. I add a photo from another day later, with the red meat entrecote (brutal). Recommendable"
ChIJ1Z-L1cQoQg0R3rauhJ8ndaQ,5,Best chicken around. Highly recommended!
ChIJ1Z-L1cQoQg0R3rauhJ8ndaQ,5,Best chicken üêî
ChIJ1Z-L1cQoQg0R3rauhJ8ndaQ,4,"It is one of the best quality-price takeaway places in Madrid without a doubt. The attention from your employee has also been very good.
They have several packs for 14.50 euros that include roast chicken with potatoes along with croquettes, dumplings or potato omelette, among others. They also have loaves of bread for 60 cents. Everything is very homemade and not at all bland as I read in other reviews.
I recommend it."
ChIJ1Z-L1cQoQg0R3rauhJ8ndaQ,1,"We bought several things and everything was terrible, we had to throw away the paella because it was so bad, aioli with a lot of garlic (we added barbecue sauce to fix it a little) but not even that, and burnt Villaroy breast with almost no bechamel,"
ChIJ1Z-L1cQoQg0R3rauhJ8ndaQ,5,"The best food house in Madrid! The chickens are a delicacy and the combined menus are varied and delicious. They also have everything: Various pastas, delicious white and red meats, salads, lentils and the exceptional paella. Various croquettes, barbecue wings, onion rings, stuffed peppers, lentils and much more and all at a super good price, flavor, quality and price go hand in hand! They also have incredible tuna empanadas. There is also bread and drinks.
And most importantly: attention! They are wonderful people and it is always a pleasure and a great pleasure to return! Thank you very much for welcoming us with such kindness and with so much homemade food of the best, the best! I absolutely recommend EL SABROSO and its people!"
ChIJb3-7Y4goQg0RgTQITTxnhYw,4,"We stopped by for some tapas and really enjoyed the food and tiramisu dessert. The huevos rotos with jam√≥n ib√©rico were especially good.
The waiter Jos√© was very friendly and helpful and very knowledgeable about wines. He made our experience at Elcano really enjoyable.Great service.  Thank you!"
ChIJb3-7Y4goQg0RgTQITTxnhYw,5,"Found this place near to our hotel while walking to a different tapas bar. We changed our mind to go inside as it was very inviting! Food was delicious, wine excellent and service was very friendly. We do our best to speak in Spanish in Madrid, but the waiter made an effort to speak in English. Thank you!"
ChIJb3-7Y4goQg0RgTQITTxnhYw,5,"Nestled in the vibrant Prosperidad neighborhood, Elcano is a quintessential Spanish tapas bar that encapsulates the essence of culinary delight. The warm and inviting ambiance sets the perfect stage for an authentic Spanish dining experience from the moment you step in. The rustic decor, reminiscent of a traditional Spanish tavern, transports patrons to the heart of Spain.

Whether indulging in the rich and savory patatas bravas or savoring the delicate flavors of their seafood offerings, the culinary expertise is evident in every dish.

The flavorful dishes, cozy ambiance, and attentive service make Elcano a standout destination in Prosperidad. Whether you're a tapas enthusiast or a newcomer to Spanish cuisine, Elcano promises a delightful gastronomic adventure that captures the true spirit of Spain in the heart of Madrid.

Last night, I hung out with a friend, and we immensely enjoyed the place."
ChIJb3-7Y4goQg0RgTQITTxnhYw,4,Good restaurant / tapas bar. Portions are generous and affordable. Service could be improved (forgotten fork and napkins) but all in all I can recommend this place.
ChIJb3-7Y4goQg0RgTQITTxnhYw,4,Good coffe with good looking delicios food to grab. One of the few places with good coffee :)
ChIJyVu6O7goQg0RRVj4BWC5GdM,5,"We did not go to the restaurant bar portion but rather the ingredient/market section

Many different asian ingredients but also soooooo many different beers.

I got me a lambic raspberry and peach beer.

I will come back to buy more kinchi"
ChIJyVu6O7goQg0RRVj4BWC5GdM,5,I am Korean and I can say that owner makes Kimchi very well :) Yum Yum (3.5 euros) they sell Korean ramen which is 2.1 euros
ChIJyVu6O7goQg0RRVj4BWC5GdM,5,"I love this place. They have some amazing options for vegans, like pink albastros icecream, beyond meat burger, heura and a huge selection of beers. The best part is you can eat inside or take away.
100% recommended"
ChIJyVu6O7goQg0RRVj4BWC5GdM,5,"This store offers a lot of products from Asia and America, also there's place to eat Asian food, but what I really appreciate is the variety of beers, I only have seen this in beer stores."
ChIJyVu6O7goQg0RRVj4BWC5GdM,5,"Small shop with curious items to buy, from really hot sauces to vegan cakes and special beers. They also serve you food ready to eat there or take home and it's delicious!"
ChIJhfuEAc8oQg0R9DsjB6f1IKY,4,"I ordered pizza online from their website. Pizza was OK, at fair prices and fast service."
ChIJhfuEAc8oQg0R9DsjB6f1IKY,5,"Pizza was honestly unreal, best pizza dough, better than dominos or Pizza Hut, highly recommend, many pizza options and good sides!"
ChIJhfuEAc8oQg0R9DsjB6f1IKY,3,Not that great. Pizza was okay but don't get chips they were not cooked and cold. Fast food definitely not.
ChIJhfuEAc8oQg0R9DsjB6f1IKY,4,"Very good pizza fast, they have a few little different types of pizza that are not in America I recommend trying them."
ChIJhfuEAc8oQg0R9DsjB6f1IKY,4,Good pizza but takes longer that it should
ChIJ4TT169EoQg0Ry-MNtWl1F_I,5,Our server Miriam went above and beyond with the service. The food is always delicious at VIPS.
ChIJ4TT169EoQg0Ry-MNtWl1F_I,5,"Phenomenal place to have a traditional breakfast. The service team is very kind, specially Miriam in my case. Recommended!"
ChIJ4TT169EoQg0Ry-MNtWl1F_I,5,I really loved the place and the food. The employers were so kind aswell as the manager. I definitly would go again there
ChIJ4TT169EoQg0Ry-MNtWl1F_I,4,"Breakfast had some good options to try but their basic toasts with butter and marmalade was very tasty . The bread is of superior quality. Along with the breakfast it includes coffee as well.
I wish they knew more English but would love to try their hollandish egg sometime. Overall a good try to repeat another time there"
ChIJ4TT169EoQg0Ry-MNtWl1F_I,4,"A standard for what to expect at a VIPS. Has a diaper changing station which is great for people with babies.

Update: Weekend service in the children's area in the morning, which we've done several times recently, is horrible. The waiter keeps forgetting your order and disappears often."
ChIJeb1cXtIoQg0Rt3Y8FjYgpSk,5,"The place smells like truffles because their signature appetizer has truffles in it which is delicious. I ordered calamares but a la plancha instead of fried and they nailed it. The sandwich named after the restaurant looked good, I want to order it next time."
ChIJeb1cXtIoQg0Rt3Y8FjYgpSk,5,"The place is amazing, the food is pretty good, and if you have a good relationship with the staff it can get even better."
ChIJeb1cXtIoQg0Rt3Y8FjYgpSk,4,"Excellent. Staff is great, quality more than ok, good prices..."
ChIJeb1cXtIoQg0Rt3Y8FjYgpSk,5,"Like...
Perfect...
Delicious..."
ChIJeb1cXtIoQg0Rt3Y8FjYgpSk,5,Good good. Friendly staff.
ChIJIUqe4dIoQg0RD_q_V2nCg_g,1,"Unfortunately, this restaurant uses pre-made and frozen sauces and food. If you want real authentic Chinese food, this is not the place. Nothing that we had was home made (Dim Sum, beef with curry, Chicken with lemon). For example, the Pad Thai is just noodles with sweet sour sauce. The service was friendly!"
ChIJIUqe4dIoQg0RD_q_V2nCg_g,4,"Funny fact: if you take away the lunch menu it keeps the same price and excludes drink and dessert... mmmh everywhere else it is cheaper as you do not occupy a table, do not need waiters, but OK, it's their business plan. My advice: eat on site and enjoy your drink &  dessert. It is expensive for a chinese restaurant but good quality and elaborated food. The cheapest lunch menu is 11.50‚Ç¨. There are a lot of options on the lunch menu, I mean a looot: 20 starters, 6 sides, 22 mains and 5 desserts or tea/coffee. The food was good, the waiters were attentive and kind."
ChIJIUqe4dIoQg0RD_q_V2nCg_g,4,Really good Chinese restaurant. Services is amazing! Really attentive and friendly! Food is good and price is perfect. The place is nice. (Dessert is not their strong)
ChIJIUqe4dIoQg0RD_q_V2nCg_g,4,"We come here often and very much enjoy the food and the attention.

They have a very big selection for lunch menu, as well as different selection other than the menu options. I very much enjoy the entree's and the crispy duck with that wonderful sauce ‚ú®üëå"
ChIJIUqe4dIoQg0RD_q_V2nCg_g,4,I had the pleasure of eating with you last night. Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Thank you so much for the best grilled noodles we have ever had.
ChIJ5Z31HdMoQg0RQdzoCFZlp7E,5,Fresh food with generous portions and at a good price. Friendly service too.
ChIJ5Z31HdMoQg0RQdzoCFZlp7E,5,"I had a celebration for my birthday there and it was excellent and all my guests enjoyed it. The portions were very generous.
The staff were very friendly and efficient.
I had previously had meal there which was excellent which was why I chose it this time..
I would plan to visit it again when I next visit Madrid."
ChIJ5Z31HdMoQg0RQdzoCFZlp7E,4,"Very good restaurant. The restaurant menu is  not sophisticated,  but based on quality and quantity. Great place for launch or dinner with friends.

Also, Great aperitivos if you look for just a drink"
ChIJ5Z31HdMoQg0RQdzoCFZlp7E,4,"Very tasteful traditional Spanish dishes... quick service and sitting in the terrace is great, because they have those water sprinklers so you don‚Äôt feel the heat! Try their boquerones fritos with a glass of tinto de verano...you will love it!"
ChIJ5Z31HdMoQg0RQdzoCFZlp7E,4,"The croquetas carabineros are world class, the meat is cooked very well, service is very good but selection of beer extremely poor"
ChIJ631sIDsvQg0RpzHnAKCx-qM,5,"The staff is super friendly and attentive. We just went for nibbles, which were good quality but a bit pricey. Around 32‚Ç¨ per person  (4 beers, 1 water bottle, 1juice, cheese, olives, jamon Serrano, and a small plate of mussels). We will come back to try the meat plates. (Dinner just after 21h)"
ChIJ631sIDsvQg0RpzHnAKCx-qM,5,Wonderful dinner at El Pitaco this evening. Food was fantastic and service was also brilliant and the staff were very understanding with my attempts at speaking Spanish üá™üá∏ Would recommend not ordering a starter as you get Chorizo sausage and croquettes anyway and portions were very generous.
ChIJ631sIDsvQg0RpzHnAKCx-qM,5,Wonderful and scrumptious dishes made with pride and even better service. The Rabo de toro was exceptional. The Bacalao pil pil was a new dish explored and a good decision as well (who knew cod and yolk would be such a blessed pairing). I would recommend El Pitaco without hesitation.
ChIJ631sIDsvQg0RpzHnAKCx-qM,5,"Best Spain Cocine!!!
Thanks Esteban for having us üôÇ"
ChIJ631sIDsvQg0RpzHnAKCx-qM,5,Worth the trip outside of the touristy areas of  Madrid. The staff were lovely and made an effort to make our experience special despite the language barrier. I loved everything we ordered!
ChIJeSrX4DAvQg0RCEMeEaCp_KU,5,"Spectacular quality, gender, treatment and advice. We have been placing orders for pickup and prepared trays for Christmas for some time now. It's worth shopping there.
Christmas is approaching and as in previous years, we recommend various trays to take away and enjoy with the family."
ChIJeSrX4DAvQg0RCEMeEaCp_KU,5,"I love it!!! The diversity of products, quality and personalized attention. Every time I go they have some detail with me. And they always give me top quality products. I recommend 100x100."
ChIJeSrX4DAvQg0RCEMeEaCp_KU,5,"A store that is a tradition for the whole family, since we are of Asturian origin, it couldn't be any other way... And in my case, I always go to get the ingredients for the fabada there and people are amazed by the colors with ""my hand"" but I always say that the secret is in the product and here it is first class. Being there I can't help but take everything since the cold cuts (especially hams and cheeses) and the meat are amazing...And those homemade ribeye hamburgers with seafood fabric. I haven't tried fish (I'm allergic) but in terms of vegetables they are also well served. For me, a fixture on my shopping list due to the great quality."
ChIJeSrX4DAvQg0RCEMeEaCp_KU,4,"The quality of their products is great and so is the service. My main problem is that all the clerks, except the person at the cash register, are men. I don't quite understand that at this point there is no more equality. It has to be compensated."
ChIJeSrX4DAvQg0RCEMeEaCp_KU,5,Excellent staff and gender. I have been buying for years and their quality and treatment are the best I have seen.
ChIJEUbedjEvQg0RXsjwOJZCa1w,4,"Super local food and ambient.
The food we tried was ok if we‚Äôre honest, but     Felt like the proper local food and experience."
ChIJEUbedjEvQg0RXsjwOJZCa1w,5,Taste their unique taste in the seafood.
ChIJEUbedjEvQg0RXsjwOJZCa1w,5,Super friendly super delicious ü§©
ChIJEUbedjEvQg0RXsjwOJZCa1w,4,Good option for business lunch
ChIJEUbedjEvQg0RXsjwOJZCa1w,4,"Crowded, that says it all. Very very fast, super helpful and friendly. If you want to have a good midweek menu, at an affordable price, don't hesitate, this is the place."
ChIJ14sfFjcvQg0R_2OIsOtMZoQ,3,"This is no longer called Gastro bar Yolanda, now it is called La Nueva Esperanza III, run by a person of Chinese origin, 2 times I sat on the terrace with hot bottles with very little cold, I have not gone again, a good aperitif."
ChIJ14sfFjcvQg0R_2OIsOtMZoQ,5,"Great ‚ò∫Ô∏è I have been there many times for breakfast and lunch.
They always serve you with a smile and confidence as if you were in your own home, and the owner Yolanda is like a second mommy.
Thank you for everything and for your coffees ü•∞"
ChIJ14sfFjcvQg0R_2OIsOtMZoQ,3,"A place without air conditioning, and without toilet paper, and the cistern broken.
The toast is a bit hard for my taste, the good thing is that the quantity is generous for the price, yes. And the service is fast and friendly."
ChIJ14sfFjcvQg0R_2OIsOtMZoQ,5,"Yolanda and Juan run this store, at the north entrance of the San Pascual market in the Barrio de la Concepci√≥n

Breakfasts, assembled (grilled bacon my favorite).

Menus of the day to eat there and also to take away.

They also prepare meals for these Christmas parties, saving us the hassle of preparing them and at a good price."
ChIJ14sfFjcvQg0R_2OIsOtMZoQ,5,Exquisite cheese board and excellent wine to repeat
ChIJCUyz7TEvQg0ROisb-2ZmInY,4,"Great food, very good service, not all orders were shown on the screen so I had to ask the staff, David was very nice and helped. Loads of young youths in there, very loud, God knows how the staff cope. Apart from that all good."
ChIJCUyz7TEvQg0ROisb-2ZmInY,4,"Your usual Burger King, this one is pretty clean, customers are mostly workers from nearby offices. Indoor and outdoor dinning areas. Childrens playground. One hour free parking next door, otherwise difficult to park on the street."
ChIJCUyz7TEvQg0ROisb-2ZmInY,3,"Great place for kids to play winter or summer as they have playground in and out.
Place is spacious and nice. 3 stars are for the place. Ana the lady on the case, hard to get her smiling or helping, after more than 45 minutes that my kids spill the juice, still waiting for someone to come an clean it or some napkins... I went to the toilet for some toilet paper and ask few customers for their own, I am even afraid of asking her again.... not friendly at all..."
ChIJCUyz7TEvQg0ROisb-2ZmInY,4,"A clean burgerking, that is why i gave 4 stars for atmosphere. The service could be better, the person at the counter seemed to be disconnected to this planet ... Even the usual greetings came out vague and mumbled ..."
ChIJCUyz7TEvQg0ROisb-2ZmInY,1,Ordered a chicken burger. When I reached home chicken had turned into a cow. When I return it back they don't even apologize for it!!
ChIJcfM9PLcoQg0RvX8iutXAV_A,5,"Good, fresh and super affordable. The place is new and clean. Friendly staff and great service. We ordered sushi, gyozas, edamame, noodles, a red curry wok and dessert. The fish was really fresh, everything perfectly cooked and beautifully served, and the red curry was the most flavorful I've tried in a long time! We'll definitely go back! Price for two people under 25e drinks included!!"
ChIJcfM9PLcoQg0RvX8iutXAV_A,5,"10/10!! One of the best delivery orders I have ever made... quality food, reasonable prices, amazing presentation and fast service!! Highly recommended as one of the top Japanese restaurants!"
ChIJcfM9PLcoQg0RvX8iutXAV_A,5,I ordered from this restaurant twice before on UberEATS and visited today in person :) I had my usual Pad Thai and it was delicious and beautifully presented. When I arrived the kitchen was about to close but they still took my order with a smile and allowed me to sit inside. Thank you and keep up the great worküèÜ üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥üçú
ChIJcfM9PLcoQg0RvX8iutXAV_A,5,"It was open only to take away, it could be because they were opening when I arrived, the food was good."
ChIJcfM9PLcoQg0RvX8iutXAV_A,4,"This place was a really nice discovery and we will definitely come back. We had two set menus, dishes were simple and deliscious and carefully put together. We really enjoyed our food, great value for money too."
ChIJJx77OjAvQg0RRQE24l0DcBQ,4,Not bad. Will be back
ChIJJx77OjAvQg0RRQE24l0DcBQ,5,Fresh sandwiches and great salads !!
ChIJJx77OjAvQg0RRQE24l0DcBQ,1,"Salad buffet? Misleading advertising. Unique salad dish in a bowl with a base of your choice (lettuce, pasta or rice) and 3 ingredients also to choose from, charging an extra ingredient at 0.80. The price of the drink (cans of beer or soda) prohibitive. Not recommended."
ChIJJx77OjAvQg0RRQE24l0DcBQ,5,"Excellent attention from Mayra and Johanna, delicious breakfasts!! 100% recommended!!!! Thank you Girls for your kindness always ü§ó"
ChIJJx77OjAvQg0RRQE24l0DcBQ,5,"A place like no other, I have seen few Viennas that are this welcoming, they are very friendly and attentive! I would definitely return!"
ChIJU-yZLjAvQg0RF9ov9exnDP0,5,"I had lunch menu, it was great! Menu selection and taste all good!! Also, waiters and waitresses were super attentive and nice!"
ChIJU-yZLjAvQg0RF9ov9exnDP0,4,"Often have breakfast here. Opens nice and early, 07:00. Has a good selection and variety. Good service."
ChIJU-yZLjAvQg0RF9ov9exnDP0,4,Atmosphere only low because it is a how much atmosphere can a place you go to for the menu have?   Really recommend for their daily menu
ChIJU-yZLjAvQg0RF9ov9exnDP0,4,"Very nice, good food and great service. Just kind of hot weather to eat outside, it needs some sort of cooling system outside"
ChIJU-yZLjAvQg0RF9ov9exnDP0,4,Good food. Daily menu for lunch for under 12‚Ç¨. Excellent value.
ChIJe1frtzkvQg0RAc20SLi4tD8,5,The tapas here (they bring them for free when you order a drink) are so abundant and so delicious. This is my favorite tapas place in Madrid
ChIJe1frtzkvQg0RAc20SLi4tD8,5,Numerous tapas which keep coming along with each drink. Great way to fill up your tummy as you drink
ChIJe1frtzkvQg0RAc20SLi4tD8,5,Wow. ‚Ç¨2 for a glass of Ribera - tapas included!!!
ChIJe1frtzkvQg0RAc20SLi4tD8,5,Very good ratio of quality to price
ChIJe1frtzkvQg0RAc20SLi4tD8,3,It's very affordable and the food is okay. I got food poisoned once though it could have been bad luck.
ChIJv1CeSzgvQg0RAox4hb1wRLQ,5,best place ever!!!!! And I mean the BEST!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChIJv1CeSzgvQg0RAox4hb1wRLQ,5,Some of the finest bravas in Madrid. Great terraza and friendly service! I've been countless times.
ChIJv1CeSzgvQg0RAox4hb1wRLQ,5,It has the best patatas bravas I've tried so far and I've tried several.
ChIJv1CeSzgvQg0RAox4hb1wRLQ,4,Great place to take some ca√±itas and have olives and Patatas Bravas (Mad potatoes) as tapas. üôä
ChIJv1CeSzgvQg0RAox4hb1wRLQ,5,One of the best authentic Spanish pubs to go
ChIJ2WmS3TkvQg0RhUz1fw8TQPk,3,"Because of the lack of cleanliness, plates with half eaten food on them piled on the bar (you're forced to sniff them when ordering at the bar) I would have given this bar only one star. But I feel compelled to say that the food isn't bad and that the young  Chinese waitress makes eating here a tolerable experience and she seems to receive little or no support from other staff in her commendable efforts to make this an enjoyable experience. She deserves a pay rise. Having said all that I still don't feel comfortable ordering more than a coffee."
ChIJ2WmS3TkvQg0RhUz1fw8TQPk,5,They are always so helpful and patient here
ChIJ2WmS3TkvQg0RhUz1fw8TQPk,5,Highly recommend.
ChIJ2WmS3TkvQg0RhUz1fw8TQPk,5,Very GoodÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
ChIJ2WmS3TkvQg0RhUz1fw8TQPk,5,Nice place!
ChIJKaYo-s0oQg0RmOPialzPJug,5,"What lovely service and delicious food! This place knows the value of true customer service, we came as a big group and Freddie handled us with care and consideration. He showed compassion for our 96 year old granny and continually checked in on us.
The food was amazing! I had the gazpacho and grilled sea bass and it is one of the best I have had to date üòä
This place is great value for money, the portions were brilliant

100 percent recommend this place, the food, the atmosphere, seating and especially the service 10/10!"
ChIJKaYo-s0oQg0RmOPialzPJug,4,The local ham were good as well as service. The terrasse is a better bet.
ChIJKaYo-s0oQg0RmOPialzPJug,4,"Lived around the corner form this place so been to it quite a lot in all seasons. Fantastic food, atmosphere, and service. Miss it immensely. Looking forward to revisiting once I'm back in Madrid."
ChIJKaYo-s0oQg0RmOPialzPJug,3,"Good neighborhood option, especially in summer, when the terraza is quite good. Most similar (in the area) to a traditional bar. Service less arrogant / better mannered vs Esquina Ib√©rica"
ChIJKaYo-s0oQg0RmOPialzPJug,3,"Really nice food and staff. The negative point is the place itself: rather old fashioned and at first sight you may question its cleanliness, but once you see the food, you acknowledge the quality of it"
ChIJr8b-JDAvQg0RSOEy8NhArK0,2,"Called for a Sunday evening meal and a beer. It was about one quarter full, so not too busy. Ordered a beer which was served in few minutes.  Waited for over twenty minutes for someone to take my order but completely ignored. I eventually asked a young girl if she could take my order which was VIPs beef Wellington signature dish but was not available. The mushroom starter was overdone and the tagliatelle was a scientific experiment which was served a minute or so after the 'crispy' starter. All for the princely sum of ‚Ç¨28.90.
Management, please sample your own dishes before you serve them, and give the customer a meal to remember."
ChIJr8b-JDAvQg0RSOEy8NhArK0,5,Really happy to find this place. As not many open in siesta ü§£ and we‚Äôd just arrived and needed food. Excellent food. Friendly service. And good value for money. We will be back.
ChIJr8b-JDAvQg0RSOEy8NhArK0,4,Friendly and fast service. Good breakfast deals.
ChIJr8b-JDAvQg0RSOEy8NhArK0,5,The food was awesome and we will definitely come back soon.We loved the ‚ÄúMuy abierto‚Äù sign.Also super friendly staff especially Camila and Paula.If you go there at night and look out of the window at Christmas there will be a lot of light=very pretty view.
ChIJr8b-JDAvQg0RSOEy8NhArK0,5,"The food was amazing, the brunch menu was full of options! Out waitress Lia was also great giving us recommendations on what to do in the city, will definitely come back!"
ChIJP4Y0_s0oQg0RSR4XD2awwMM,5,Loved it .laid back .stayed three hours in street during evening ..best food we have had in Madrid. Great wait staff who tried her best to accommodate us. Enjoyed very much .thank you for a lovely evening
ChIJP4Y0_s0oQg0RSR4XD2awwMM,3,"Neighbourhood bar with traditional Spanish tapas and dishes. Good  ""salmorejo"" ;) and good service"
ChIJP4Y0_s0oQg0RSR4XD2awwMM,2,"Poor service, not cheap. It was not a great experience."
ChIJP4Y0_s0oQg0RSR4XD2awwMM,5,"It was Sunday and the day before Kings Day, at 4:15 p.m., we left the house with the idea that we wouldn't be able to eat anywhere. Suddenly we found an outdoor terrace completely sealed with a tent and with very powerful heaters, so we decided to order some beers. When we arrived they told us that at the indicated time they were still serving meals, so we decided to order. We have to say that the patatas bravas were very good and 100% homemade, a portion for only 8.50 euros, I think words are unnecessary. We also ordered dogfish in adobo, which being Sevillians it is difficult to find something acceptable in Madrid, it is not the best I have ever eaten but I have to admit that it was good, not acceptable, good. Finally we ate some mixed croquettes, of which I can highlight the cod ones, and especially the boletus ones, the soft and light texture of the bechamel and the concentrated and very rich flavor. In addition, Veronica is wonderful and the service is great and very friendly. I encourage you to try this place, with cheap prices, average quality, 10-rated service and a lot of love in the kitchen, since everything is homemade."
ChIJP4Y0_s0oQg0RSR4XD2awwMM,4,"The place is nice. The terrace is quite comfortable, although with the usual noises of a road next door. The staff is friendly. Pretty basic food. Passable. The cheesecake was delicious. I think the price you see on the board is for the weekend. During the week I think they are ‚Ç¨12/13"
ChIJxx93OTovQg0RMWpck9BeZiE,5,"Lovely hidden place in Barrio Concepci√≥n with great coffee, which these days is almost impossible to get in Madrid"
ChIJxx93OTovQg0RMWpck9BeZiE,5,Good selection of local tapas.
ChIJxx93OTovQg0RMWpck9BeZiE,4,yummy tapas
ChIJxx93OTovQg0RMWpck9BeZiE,5,"Long-standing bar in the neighborhood. Super spacious and comfortable terrace. We were there today, a rainy day, with my son and my dog ‚Äã‚Äãand they have behaved wonderfully with all of us. Delicious food, even better service. Recommended!"
ChIJxx93OTovQg0RMWpck9BeZiE,5,"The experience has been crazy and very very pleasant and good. The treatment is wonderful and everything is very homemade, the food is delicious and the quantities are generous. A discovery of a bar and place, quiet and comfortable. Great and I will return without thinking about it. He spoiled the cook and the waiter, ole and ole!"
ChIJP0etPTUvQg0REjsdimmz5jE,1,Worst fast food restaurant I‚Äòve ever been to. An employee was standing around doing nothing while I waited for one single ice cream. Everything is dirty and everyone is rude.
ChIJP0etPTUvQg0REjsdimmz5jE,2,"I got chicken wings, onion rings and chicken nuggets. The wings were burnt, onion rings was soggy and everything tasted stale. They gave me lots of ketchup and extra sauce, though. And the store was clean."
ChIJP0etPTUvQg0REjsdimmz5jE,1,"nobody cares about actually preparing the food, you have to ask them to make it. We have waited for 24 minutes for the food"
ChIJP0etPTUvQg0REjsdimmz5jE,3,"The place is fine.Ive gone several times but weirdly enough they only have takeout on the machines.
For some reason though, whenever I eat here I get stomach aches.
Overall it's ok but for the prices it's best to go elsewhere."
ChIJP0etPTUvQg0REjsdimmz5jE,5,"Great GF burgers and fast service, non Spanish speaker so the touch screens for ordering was super convenient, thank you."
ChIJ2WmS3TkvQg0RBK-vGwfnE00,4,Ordered the Padthai with prawns and the Kung pao chicken. Food tasted fresh and perfect. The padthai was beautifully packed with peanuts on top while the Kung pao chicken was specially made extra spicy just like we asked. Great experience. Reasonably priced.
ChIJ2WmS3TkvQg0RBK-vGwfnE00,5,It was a great experience! The service was awsome.
ChIJ2WmS3TkvQg0RBK-vGwfnE00,1,"What I think is that they have changed owners. My trusted restaurant for years has lost all my interest. The spring roll is a shame, small and frozen, when before you could tell that it was homemade and was twice as big (see the photo shared by Patricia Guzm√°n
to see what they were like before), it was one of my favorite dishes and the biggest culprit of this review. The prices, absolutely out of the market, have directly doubled, greatly lowering the quality and quantity. Lost customer, a shame after more than 10 years being loyal to the restaurant."
ChIJ2WmS3TkvQg0RBK-vGwfnE00,2,"We always ordered food, now the last time, they sent us everything with half the content, the spring rolls were half the size, the almond chicken, which we ordered two portions, is not even half of what it was before. I attach a photo so you can see what I'm talking about, let's not forget that the chicken portion that I show you is 8 euros. We will not order again!"
ChIJ2WmS3TkvQg0RBK-vGwfnE00,5,"My experience was very good. I ordered food through just eat and they were very fast and everything was delicious, typical Chinese. It's true that it's a little expensive but those prices are getting higher in the neighborhood..."
ChIJUd_4F0cvQg0RHFzWUv9wVXw,5,Got a leg of jam√≥n for christmas these guys cut it up and put it into vaccum packs. Also told me how store them..very helpful and friendly guys. Plus grest value for money
ChIJUd_4F0cvQg0RHFzWUv9wVXw,5,"Excellent service and attention.
I brought a pallet to have it cut and they recommended doing it by machine, since it was the most appropriate in my case. The treatment of √Ångel and the rest of the staff was spectacular: close, professional and very friendly. The delivery of the shoulder, perfectly vacuum packed and with the bones included, was a luxury. Without a doubt, a first-class store."
ChIJUd_4F0cvQg0RHFzWUv9wVXw,5,"The best place in Madrid to buy Iberian ham and all types of sausages and products from Spain with exquisite quality and an unbeatable price. A spectacular manual knife cut. And best of all, the kindness, sympathy and good work of all the staff! I've been traveling from the other side of Madrid for years! And for many more years!! Thanks a lot!"
ChIJUd_4F0cvQg0RHFzWUv9wVXw,5,"I discovered the site by chance while searching the internet, and it was a success! I brought a shoulder to cut and I couldn't be happier. Very professional, friendly and close treatment, I was also tight on time and they gave me all the facilities. They have gotten a great performance out of the ham. I definitely recommend it and I will repeat with them whenever I need it. Super recommended!"
ChIJUd_4F0cvQg0RHFzWUv9wVXw,5,Great professionals. I brought a ham to be cut by machine and I am very satisfied with the service provided. The ham is very well cut and packaged. They also guarantee the delivery date. 100% recommended
ChIJA6GF9C6HQQ0R0nihiMu37Rk,5,"The review corresponds to desencaja country club. I suppose that the previous ones correspond to the old management.

Very good cuisine and also with a birthday gift included. It's a shame that it rained so we couldn't enjoy the terrace."
ChIJA6GF9C6HQQ0R0nihiMu37Rk,5,"Fantastic night and Birthday Celebration. The quality of the dinner accompanied the magnificent surroundings. The lobster croquettes and the wild boar dumplings are very good. The seconds, both meat and fish (bonito and cocochas), were wonderful, all accompanied by a good wine list. If you add to that the fantastic attention of Mara and the entire team, more could be asked for. Thank you for everything and of course we will see each other again."
ChIJA6GF9C6HQQ0R0nihiMu37Rk,1,"How is it possible that the variety at the Golf Restaurant continues to be so bad and of low quality!!!!
Really, there is no person with judgment who can improve the restoration of the Club?????
It's a real shame.
We also called ahead to reserve a table, they told us there was no table..., we still went and were surprised that almost all the tables were empty..."
ChIJA6GF9C6HQQ0R0nihiMu37Rk,2,"June 2023

We went to eat and the place was very nice. We had two menus of the day that were good and the carabineros rice for 2. It was excessively thin, scarce in short and not a little socarrat but rather the carabineros were burned a little raw and they were the only stumbles in short a poor rice, scarce and burnt"
ChIJA6GF9C6HQQ0R0nihiMu37Rk,2,"The place is beautiful. The restaurant is shabby, they give you bread and appetizers without asking and they charge for it, just like for the water they give from the tap. You ask to take what's left and they say no. Some dishes are better than others, none are very good and some are very bad"
ChIJuWUdWY4pQg0R7phcBU5gl5o,4,"Veterinary faculty cafeteria. They have menus, combos, sandwiches, tapas, drinks... Acceptable quality, correct without fanfare (it has lost over the years) The service depends on who serves you, there is everything, friendly, nice or indifferent. Prices perhaps high considering that the quantity and quality has been decreasing over the years, unlike the prices. They have a lot of space, it is very large and they have a terrace, although it smells a lot like fried food. They also have a microwave to heat tupperware."
ChIJuWUdWY4pQg0R7phcBU5gl5o,1,"They have just closed the cafeteria, by order of the City Council. Due to deficiencies, it is a shame that the rector does not give an explanation to the students who have paid their ""not cheap tuition."""
ChIJuWUdWY4pQg0R7phcBU5gl5o,4,Good cafe with good prices. The menu is quite varied and is quite good. Those who work there are very nice and polite most of the time.
ChIJuWUdWY4pQg0R7phcBU5gl5o,5,Always good atmosphere. Julio is a phenomenon and the entire team is great. They brighten your morning with your morning coffee.
ChIJuWUdWY4pQg0R7phcBU5gl5o,5,"Rich, quality menu and very good price (‚Ç¨6). Friendly waiters."
ChIJLUg3RkkoQg0RxD3lzUU1m9c,3,It's okay. If you are a young student or life in the housing close by. I would recommend otherwise
ChIJLUg3RkkoQg0RxD3lzUU1m9c,2,"Great food, but the cashier is a total jerk. He has been rude both visits."
ChIJLUg3RkkoQg0RxD3lzUU1m9c,5,great
ChIJLUg3RkkoQg0RxD3lzUU1m9c,5,"It must be a pleasure to live in a college and have a Goiko just two minutes away. They don't have the entire menu of the original Goiko but it is enough to enjoy a good burger at their tables. The place itself is not very big and it usually fills up, but in the area it is the best burger you can ask for. Highly recommend the Kevin Bacon"
ChIJLUg3RkkoQg0RxD3lzUU1m9c,5,"Great burgers inside the residence, it is somewhat hidden but the service is exquisite, as always. The burgers are very good. Perhaps it is more oriented towards students but with the same quality as the other goikos. Highly recommended"
ChIJS2dLz9QpQg0RFw6gUxN0IAY,5,Some crack... I love you
ChIJS2dLz9QpQg0RFw6gUxN0IAY,5,Correct
ChIJS2dLz9QpQg0RFw6gUxN0IAY,5,

ChIJS2dLz9QpQg0RFw6gUxN0IAY,5,
ChIJ79F3Va0pQg0RnDTBmDdgYqM,5,My husband and I enjoyed our meal at this restaurant. We had burgers and they asked for how much cooked we would like our burgers. And the food was tasty. The staff were very friendly. Specifically Glendy served us and she was very nice and welcoming. Overall good experience and nice patio.
ChIJ79F3Va0pQg0RnDTBmDdgYqM,5,Food was super good and our server Jose was very kind and attentive üôèüèº
ChIJ79F3Va0pQg0RnDTBmDdgYqM,1,"Scarce. The dream burger is far from a dream food. Way too expensive for a burger made Mc Donald‚Äôs fashion.
Disappointing at best.
Waiters were awesome on the other."
ChIJ79F3Va0pQg0RnDTBmDdgYqM,5,Many thanks to server Juego!  He give strong drink make me fall down happy!  Cow sides with bonbon sauce amazing
ChIJ79F3Va0pQg0RnDTBmDdgYqM,5,Nice place and great burgers. And our waitress Arelis was super friendly.
ChIJr5oHdE4oQg0Rq6Vjsbu1neI,5,"The meat is absolutely amazing, and so are the starters.  Very well priced.  Service is a bit rough on the edges but the food makes up for it."
ChIJr5oHdE4oQg0Rq6Vjsbu1neI,4,"We had the fried artichokes and the pulpo. Would reorder the pulpo. The artichokes aren‚Äôt crispy enough. The octopus was tender and quite delicious. I had the solomillo, cooked to perfection! My partner had the cod, it was delicious. We use to go 24 years ago, it was wonderful then and good now surprisingly. The patatas souffl√© were greasy not crunchy as before and the apple tatin was perfect! They do need to improve their wine selection. Also, the waiter was a one man show, he handled the restaurant alone and was efficient and no excessive waiting time between plates! He was great! Will I return, yes! Price, quality and service was great. The decor needs updates, in my opinion, not cozy quite cold and generic."
ChIJr5oHdE4oQg0Rq6Vjsbu1neI,5,"The food was amazing! It was a nice experience and a small restaurant. The waitstaff was incredibly nice and attentive. If you're looking for a place for a nice dinner, this is definitely your place."
ChIJr5oHdE4oQg0Rq6Vjsbu1neI,5,Very good place. Excellent meat. Only the extern appearance should be improved.
ChIJr5oHdE4oQg0Rq6Vjsbu1neI,3,"Good food, but small portions for the price."
ChIJM5BGw1EoQg0RT17Bhd_aSsw,5,"Im a regular here as a student at the close american school, this establishment is perfect to practice spanish and feel apart of the culture. They are eternally sweet, welcoming, and delicious. Will continue to go here and reccomend it to everyone for good sandwiches, free wifi, and kind people."
ChIJM5BGw1EoQg0RT17Bhd_aSsw,4,"Menu caf√© com p√£o e Jamon Crudo estavam saborosos e pre√ßo justo (3‚Ç¨50). Ambiente sem ventila√ß√£o, mas atendeu para uma comidinha r√°pida. O melhor mesmo √© que abre cedo (6:00am)"
ChIJM5BGw1EoQg0RT17Bhd_aSsw,5,"A cool place. The owner is a crack, she always greets the regulars and is very nice (very nice, you'll see). The tomato bars come very full of tomato (not like in other places where one of the two bars is almost orphaned), the coffee with soy milk is very delicious and although there are always people you can find a place to take out your laptop and write something (they have wifi). Good price. I have to come try their menu."
ChIJM5BGw1EoQg0RT17Bhd_aSsw,5,"The owner of the bar is very attentive. He serves you perfectly and always with a smile. With the tapas that it gives you eat.
Perfect for having a drink with friends."
ChIJM5BGw1EoQg0RT17Bhd_aSsw,4,"Abundant portions and very good flavor. The waitress there (yes, Asian) has a lot of sparkle. He treated us perfectly and recommended several portions. Good place to hang out"
ChIJt-xSPlIoQg0R_hl69pMCsk0,4,"Great place!

Even though I don't speak a lot of Spanish and the staff doesn't speak a lot of English we were able to communicate. Most importantly, the staff was willing to try to understand us.

We asked the staff to show a Premier League match and they obliged, even during an ongoing La Liga game (granted, Real Valladolid - Osasuna).

The food is good, nothing to write home about but as far as sports bar food goes it's not bad by any means.

My maid take away from this place is the good service. If you are visiting and want a nice place to watch your football this is a good place to go."
ChIJt-xSPlIoQg0R_hl69pMCsk0,4,"Randomly happened in this cozy spot for a football match, they have several screens and a terrace. Highly recommended for beers with friends! Staff was very accommodating although almost at closing time too, thank you will be back!"
ChIJt-xSPlIoQg0R_hl69pMCsk0,5,"This place was just at the back of our hotel. I can't fault it in any way.
Great food and variety,  excellent beers and very friendly atmosphere,  service. I will truly miss Jose Miguel, he really knows how to run the business and look after his customers.
Great personality he is a great asset to the establishment.  I  was there almost every evening.  I'm missing you buddy. Miguel"
ChIJt-xSPlIoQg0R_hl69pMCsk0,5,Great place to watch a big football game! Owner and staff were friendly and accommodating!
ChIJt-xSPlIoQg0R_hl69pMCsk0,5,"We ate burgers, which were amazing! Great meat, and great beer.
A+ service and seeing FCBarcelona win, no better way to end the night. Nor a better outcome ;)"
ChIJxZyJnlEoQg0R6ugzzdTOdMk,5,"Amazing place to have some delicious  food and drink while playing as many games as you can üòÅ had so much fun and now want to own all of these! (I actually got the kitten one for Christmas, so now sushi go is the next on my list)"
ChIJxZyJnlEoQg0R6ugzzdTOdMk,5,Great place! You pay 3‚Ç¨ and you can play all day. There's a big choice of board games. The staff is really friendly; they will help you choose your games. The food is quite good. The environment could not be better: there was a competition on a famous map strategy game and a large group of Down syndrome people.
ChIJxZyJnlEoQg0R6ugzzdTOdMk,4,"It's amaziiiiiing. They have over 1000 board games, you only have to pay 3 euros and you can spend the day there. The food is a little bit expensive and we order son milkshakes and it didn't really taste like Oreo and kinder Bueno. But overall if you want to hang out with your friends and have a really good time playing. This is a nice place."
ChIJxZyJnlEoQg0R6ugzzdTOdMk,4,"We went here to play and have a few drinks. They have more than a thousand board games, this means there are options for all tastes. We did try a few different games and had tons of fun.
They also serve coffeeshop food so if you're planning to grab a bite while playing, your welcome.
A couple of things with considering are that you pay 3 Euros add the entrance fee (charged when you leave). Don't forget to reserve a table in advance if you don't want to wait, and finally remember you're not allowed to get excited or make noise if you win !?!?!?!
I recommend this place for all you boardgame loves, although there service isn't perfect."
ChIJxZyJnlEoQg0R6ugzzdTOdMk,2,"3‚Ç¨ per person just to play games is excessive, the menu is as expensive as well and it's not justified by any means, there are other places in the city that will let you play games for free when you consume.
Although for that price you get an extensive selection of games to play."
ChIJ5fkZs1MoQg0RhXa1uTSNiOc,4,Dropped in for late dinner.  Had the kiosks to order; punched in some items that are not in the US to try them out.  Completed my order and got a receipt that the order didn‚Äôt go through and go to the counter to order.  Went to order at the counter and got a classic whopper with cheese; same tastes as a US one but with more vegetables.
ChIJ5fkZs1MoQg0RhXa1uTSNiOc,1,"This has to be one of the worst Burger King locations I've ever been to. You'd think with the local management team being on the second floor, this location would be well run. I have reached out many times with surveys, Twitter, and other mediums regarding issues here. They simply do not care. They seem just as frustrated as I am with trying to place and get orders. It doesn't matter what time of day you go, the service is horrible. Food is decent only when you show up at a busy time. If not, your fries and proteins will be cold. The new ice coffee/coffee items are hit and miss. For what it's worth, there's so many other options in either direction, check one of them out instead."
ChIJ5fkZs1MoQg0RhXa1uTSNiOc,4,"We stopped by here to try out their truffle burger since it sounded enticing. Despite their marketing, it sounded like it would be a truffle explosion, it wasn‚Äôt, the truffle flavor was mild to medium, but overall the burger tasted good and may be the best fast food burger I have tasted. It had a decent sized beef pattie and was well constructed, along with the fries it was a satisfying meal. The fries were thicker cut, and despite the fact they were pretty cold by the time we sat down to eat, they still tasted good. The place was well managed despite the crowd, the employees were on top of people trying to hang out there despite the curfew."
ChIJ5fkZs1MoQg0RhXa1uTSNiOc,4,"Staff are helpful although they could be a little bit more upbeat, sometimes you feel like a nuisance to them, which is a bit awkward; I know it‚Äôs not the greatest job ever but that‚Äôs not really my fault.

Food does comes out relatively fast."
ChIJ5fkZs1MoQg0RhXa1uTSNiOc,5,So far a good BK in Madrid. Because it's been hard to find a decent one lately. Keep doing the good work and serving fresh burgers please!!! üëèüëèüëè
ChIJuZKlqqspQg0R0q8lGGUrtZU,4,"Extremely sweet guy on staff. He came after us down the street because we left one of our belongings ‚ù§Ô∏è

Clean, laid back vibe. A little bit of a language barrier in some of the signage and the prices don't quote match between the exterior of the building and the interior. For example, Kebab Men√∫ 1 is 5.50‚Ç¨ on the outside sign, but 6‚Ç¨ on the inside.

Food itself was good, but not special. I don't know if it was the timing, but the kebab shavings were thinner and dry, which means they got cold as soon as the staff put sauce on them. (And they put on a lot of sauce.)"
ChIJuZKlqqspQg0R0q8lGGUrtZU,2,You are a kebab and you are close at 3am?
ChIJuZKlqqspQg0R0q8lGGUrtZU,5,Great staff
ChIJuZKlqqspQg0R0q8lGGUrtZU,5,"Ordinary kebab, but it is a good ordinary kebab"
ChIJuZKlqqspQg0R0q8lGGUrtZU,5,Good place
ChIJj16uNE4oQg0RoY3DNe_YBWU,5,Great menu! Never get tired...
ChIJj16uNE4oQg0RoY3DNe_YBWU,4,Great local !
ChIJj16uNE4oQg0RoY3DNe_YBWU,3,"It's fine if you are looking for quality (not quantity) in an informal and traditional place. With a simple and varied menu. They don't have a menu; For 2 people with a dish each, drink and dessert to share ‚Ç¨20/person so a little expensive."
ChIJj16uNE4oQg0RoY3DNe_YBWU,5,"Restaurant with an exceptional quality-price level, all the dishes we have tried are 10, we will definitely repeat. Until next time"
ChIJj16uNE4oQg0RoY3DNe_YBWU,5,"The Baden special pizza is exquisite. Be careful with the prices, moderate but you have to watch before ordering. Good service. Parking blue spaces. Between 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. difficult to sit down, especially Friday and Saturday. Inside there is a restaurant, almost always with free tables."
ChIJ0bqAFVIoQg0Rccsan1TePEw,5,Evening meal for 2. Italian food served by lovely staff. Some language barrier but staff really helpful. Excellent attention to detail with dietary requirements.
ChIJ0bqAFVIoQg0Rccsan1TePEw,4,"Pretty decent for a chain italian restaurant. The risotto I had was better than expected, but a bit more cheese would have made it better. The house red wine was not bad. The service was above average and the locale is comfortable."
ChIJ0bqAFVIoQg0Rccsan1TePEw,5,"Among Italian food franchises, Gino's is upper mid-tier. However, this particular location always seems to be just a little but better than all their other locations. Someone in there does know how to cook, even within the restrictions of the franchise-driven menu."
ChIJ0bqAFVIoQg0Rccsan1TePEw,5,Great service and awesome food! Had the lasagna and 5 cheese pizza and enjoyed it very much. Nice ambiance as well. I recommend if you're craving Italian food!
ChIJ0bqAFVIoQg0Rccsan1TePEw,5,Awesome little restaurant!! The food was amazing. If you're looking for some Italian food I recommend stopping here. They also have menus in english.
ChIJwcCZdFEoQg0Re_3T8KSUOIE,5,"Fast service,  lots of tapas, lots of people and a very popular place among all ages.  This place for sure surprise me big time in a very positive way. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
ChIJwcCZdFEoQg0Re_3T8KSUOIE,5,Eat like the locals do. We had some tapas and a beer. The portions are big and the staff is friendly. Recommend for some tapas and drink.
ChIJwcCZdFEoQg0Re_3T8KSUOIE,5,Excellent experience... Food and service üíñüíñüíñüíñ high quality ‚ù§Ô∏èüíÉüèΩ
ChIJwcCZdFEoQg0Re_3T8KSUOIE,5,"Came here for a few drinks after our typical bars were full. We had 4 glasses of wine and 4 ca√±as and the bill came out to 17 euros. As tapas with our drinks we received tortilla de patata, eggs with jamon and fries and tuna and tomato empanadillas. If they are going to offer generous tapas like those with our drinks, there is no doubt, we will return. The waiter treated us very well and made sure we had another tapa when the group that had reserved our table came and we had to move inside. This is a typical no frills but friendly and humble neighborhood bar."
ChIJwcCZdFEoQg0Re_3T8KSUOIE,2,Service without a smile and our potatas bravas undercooked and sauce very poor.
ChIJQ1vySlIoQg0RoA-rNLqnxp4,4,"This beer centric bar serves cold pints at half price on thursdays. I like the terrace in the summer. The waitress is the best and quite the character. As for the tapas, I really enjoy the potatoes with bacon and blue cheese. The prices for the raciones are slightly high and the pints are a little too expensive without the half off deal."
ChIJQ1vySlIoQg0RoA-rNLqnxp4,1,"Terrible food and service.
We waited a very long time for the server to take our order and for the food to arrive. And the food was just reheated food, the chicken tasted like plastic. I ended up vomiting afterwards..."
ChIJQ1vySlIoQg0RoA-rNLqnxp4,5,"spectacular place, good atmosphere to drink beers"
ChIJQ1vySlIoQg0RoA-rNLqnxp4,5,Very good little Bar for Breakfast !
ChIJQ1vySlIoQg0RoA-rNLqnxp4,1,Disappointing beer selection and weird layout. No soul.
ChIJn_iEB0UpQg0R_MA-hAtQo24,5,"Excellent beer! El Aquila sin filtar is the most delicious beer i have ever drunküëåand the waitress is so lovely, but in the evening. Non of waitresses speak English and there is not an English menu. In the morning there was another waitress and she was not welcoming so i couldn't order breakfast and leave. They should arrange an English menu at least online, this way could be eaiser even if the waitress doesn't want to help you to order."
ChIJn_iEB0UpQg0R_MA-hAtQo24,4,"The food and drinks were great and our waiter was very nice. The only thing was that the food took too long, but the waiter explained they had a problem in the kitchen, so this was probably a one time issue. And the croquetas were delicious, definitely worth the wait."
ChIJn_iEB0UpQg0R_MA-hAtQo24,1,"We had a reservation through Groupon, and after we arrived there, they told us they were not serving food but only drinks. They could simply let us know in advance or cancel our reservation in advance. It cost us taxi back and forth from there."
ChIJn_iEB0UpQg0R_MA-hAtQo24,5,Nice bar to chill and have a beer
ChIJn_iEB0UpQg0R_MA-hAtQo24,5,"Great service!
Thank you so much Jose Luis!"
ChIJT6y7PlYpQg0Rf7B-9IVb9aY,2,"They get you out of trouble but the food is bad and the prices prohibitive. The usual in these establishments. A shame about this practice of robbing and taking advantage of people's needs. I give two stars for the friendliness of the employees, otherwise it would be a 0."
ChIJT6y7PlYpQg0Rf7B-9IVb9aY,1,"The sandwiches within reach of the customers, I have seen how they touch them, handle them, even uncover them to choose the filling... an unhygienic thing. Is it so hard to protect them one by one with plastic film?"
ChIJT6y7PlYpQg0Rf7B-9IVb9aY,4,"Good quality of products.
Very clean and well-kept place.
But it seems a bit expensive to me"
ChIJT6y7PlYpQg0Rf7B-9IVb9aY,1,We went to eat and I can only say that the food was regrettable!!!! We haven't finished any dishes
ChIJT6y7PlYpQg0Rf7B-9IVb9aY,2,"Quite expensive, and the truth is that the person who attended in the afternoon/night was quite unpleasant and slow."
ChIJVU3gYv0pQg0R2hlVR251aXg,4,Stopped here for lunch and some drinks. We got tortilla sandwiches and some beers. The food was okay but the staff was very friendly. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd go out of my way to go here but if you‚Äôre in the area looking for a drink and snack it‚Äôs worth a stop.
ChIJVU3gYv0pQg0R2hlVR251aXg,5,"I haven‚Äôt been inside these hallowed halls in almost two years and I miss this place nearly every day. Because I lived so close to the bar with my roommates abroad, we visited regularly and got great service. It was very uplifting to see a friendly face behind the bar every time we walked through the doors. I would recommend the wings and a round of beers with your friends whenever you get the chance. Cheers!"
ChIJVU3gYv0pQg0R2hlVR251aXg,5,"When I was abroad studying as a student, my friends and I would come to La Tortuga after class. The owner is very friendly and accommodating! It‚Äôs a great place for cheap food and drinks. The chicken wings are a MUST try. The atmosphere is for a younger audience. It‚Äôs a good place for Tapas in the afternoon or evening. We miss Tortuga and we‚Äôre so glad to see it open! We miss you Mike!
- Ian, David, Henry"
ChIJVU3gYv0pQg0R2hlVR251aXg,5,Good place to have a couple of beers and very friendly staff
ChIJVU3gYv0pQg0R2hlVR251aXg,3,If you are a student.... but Madrid has better places.
ChIJJY6cZzEpQg0RIaEuKIiPqEM,5,Good place to share a good Papapizza...üòâ
ChIJJY6cZzEpQg0RIaEuKIiPqEM,4,The pizza was quite good even though a little bit expensive. But the waiting time was really short and the girls from the halloween event were really nice.
ChIJJY6cZzEpQg0RIaEuKIiPqEM,5,"Fast delivery! Great pizzas! I give a score of 10 to their rider Dani ,very friendly and to the staff as well. Muchas gracias como siempre!"
ChIJJY6cZzEpQg0RIaEuKIiPqEM,5,Loved their pizzas and salsa üòãüëå
ChIJJY6cZzEpQg0RIaEuKIiPqEM,4,Nice spooky offer
ChIJO6awE1IoQg0RJjbIWLI8Hw4,4,"The staff was friendly and very helpful, the food was good. There is plenty of room to enjoy a casual dinner and quiet enough for us to hear each other"
ChIJO6awE1IoQg0RJjbIWLI8Hw4,3,"I recently dined at Donate, and unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming. The food was just an above average. What really stood out, though, was the attitude and behaviour of one of the staff members, a middle-aged lady who was quite arrogant. Her demeanour significantly detracted from what could have been a pleasant meal. I hope the management addresses this, as customer service is as important as the food."
ChIJO6awE1IoQg0RJjbIWLI8Hw4,5,"Visiting Madrid from the States and looking for a great place to eat authentic food-
My Spanish isn't very good but Fie was amazing at helping us decide on the perfect dish - Paella Valenciana! He and the staff were very attentive and also gave great suggestions on drinks to start our evening. This was a wonderful experience. I highly recommend dining at Donate."
ChIJO6awE1IoQg0RJjbIWLI8Hw4,5,We had an amazing experience at Donate Restaurante! The staff is accommodating to english-speaking customers who are visiting Madrid. Our waiter Fie was extremely helpful and friendly!
ChIJO6awE1IoQg0RJjbIWLI8Hw4,4,Very friendly staff and tasty food. Service can take a bit longer if the place is crowded.
ChIJ4ynmfS4pQg0RHMVaj1amIhs,5,"Food was very delicious, however quite spicy so be careful if you can't manage spices.
Sadly the people at the table next to ours were very loud so the atmosphere wasn't perfect but that's not the restaurant's fault, the d√©cor and ambiente was pretty. Some of our orders took a bit too much time for my taste but they were very busy that night so I can understand it."
ChIJ4ynmfS4pQg0RHMVaj1amIhs,5,"Came here for dinner while on vacation! The waitress was very kind and patient with my party as well, even taking our orders in English! Would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back!"
ChIJ4ynmfS4pQg0RHMVaj1amIhs,5,The best Chinese food I have ever had! Very good quality and great portions. I have been many times and it never disappoints!
ChIJ4ynmfS4pQg0RHMVaj1amIhs,5,"Good food, service and a beautiful calm atmosphere! The waiter was amazing and spoke in English to us."
ChIJ4ynmfS4pQg0RHMVaj1amIhs,1,"Spider webs in corner of restaurant, cleaning really poor. Would avoid just because of that. Loud table next to us with extreme noises and staff not doing anything to reduce the volume of the table, worst spring rolls. The rest of the food was okei but the experience is below 0. Would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.

PS! The establishment have responded, and responded with lies that is simply not true at all, making up things, the picture of the cobwebs should be enough of a reason to show the reputation of this establishment. Their response is a fabricated textbook 1-0-1 in how not to respond."
ChIJPU68XsUpQg0R3kXLj7fs9_c,5,Great outdoor vibe with delicious unique food choices. The staff was friendly and our server Katerina was outstanding!
ChIJPU68XsUpQg0R3kXLj7fs9_c,5,"Very nice foodü§§ The waiter serving us, Fay, is very nice and helpfulüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª"
ChIJPU68XsUpQg0R3kXLj7fs9_c,5,"All of these bad reviews are complete garbage. I have been to 1968 a countless amount of times, and the food is like no other. My favorite waiter, Fay, has the best service and response time in all of Madrid. I highly recommend!!"
ChIJPU68XsUpQg0R3kXLj7fs9_c,5,Wonderful service and great food! We were walking on Calle de Almansa when we saw this restaurant with a few outdoor seats and decided to have dinner. Henry helped us to pick some dishes since the menu was in Spanish. He went above and beyond his way to explain each item in the menu and made sure that we were happy with the selection. All the dishes were really good. A huge thanks to Henry for his incredible service!
ChIJPU68XsUpQg0R3kXLj7fs9_c,5,"Stopped here for an evening meal as recommended by AC hotel nearby. We had a really tasty meal and Henry, our waiter, took the time to explain the menu carefully - wonderful wonderful service that was above and beyond expectations! Well done Henry! I would highly recommend stopping here for a meal - you won't be disappointed. Also - loved the decor!"
ChIJW6ncClgpQg0Rpoee9aA35sU,5,"Nice relaxed dinner in a peaceful neighborhood. Could hear each other talk... No loud music :-)

Food was great.... Service was awesome! Would definitely recommend this place for a nice Mexican dinner."
ChIJW6ncClgpQg0Rpoee9aA35sU,4,"I gotta say, my time at Mild & Limon in Madrid was seriously awesome. The food? Oh man, it was next-level delicious, full of flavors that had my taste buds doing a happy dance. And Cristian, the host? He was on point, super friendly, and made sure we had the best time. The whole vibe in the restaurant just added to the whole experience, making it feel cozy and inviting. Mild & Limon is one of those places you won't forget in Madrid ‚Äì great food, top-notch service, and a super chill atmosphere."
ChIJW6ncClgpQg0Rpoee9aA35sU,5,"Perfect for a quick bite, portions are just enough. I would recommend getting the daily menu (starter, main, dessert)-its a great deal. Nice, casual interior and the waiter was very friendly and open."
ChIJW6ncClgpQg0Rpoee9aA35sU,5,"Great food. Friendly and very fast service!
No pics as food just was eaten too fast!"
ChIJW6ncClgpQg0Rpoee9aA35sU,5,Good food with great service. Guacamole here is so delicious!
ChIJpwqv3GIpQg0RqqouXUAVn1o,5,"I came here for a late lunch and was very surprised about the service quality. ou can feel that the lady working there (maybe the owner itself?) wants to make you feel good, enjoy your meal and time there.

The ""too vegan"" was good, the smoothie ""delightful"" was fantastic in my opinion and the place has a nice charme. Especially because of the service quality!

Very recommendable for a snack in company or alone."
ChIJpwqv3GIpQg0RqqouXUAVn1o,5,"¬°Las mejores tartas del mundo! Mar, the owner, is incredibly sweet and loves to practice her English with my friends and I. The shop is cute, and the food/coffee is delicious!"
ChIJpwqv3GIpQg0RqqouXUAVn1o,5,I love this little stop! They have really good carrot cake and I had an awesome breakfast. The staff is super nice and the service is quick.
ChIJpwqv3GIpQg0RqqouXUAVn1o,5,Lovely staff and even better food! Definitely recommend
ChIJpwqv3GIpQg0RqqouXUAVn1o,5,"Sandwiches were absolutely fantastic. Great service, very kind owner. She works very hard to make her dream a reality. The carrot cake is the best I have ever had!"
ChIJ97MB9RwpQg0RMmXxk5N7LGA,5,"I love a good german beer with their food. Certainly this is a good place to enjoy it. The staff is very very fast, polite and attentive. The daily menu is very good for the price, good quality and well served. You should try their cheese cake. I will come back"
ChIJ97MB9RwpQg0RMmXxk5N7LGA,5,I love places with german style. Beer and sausages followed the flavors and really liked them me. Waitress was polite and service as anyone like.
ChIJ97MB9RwpQg0RMmXxk5N7LGA,1,"We had a rather bad experience. Chicken we got was raw and one of our group was throwing up the whole night after having had dinner here. Also, the waiter was putting in trash bags into a big trash bin in the middle of the restaurant."
ChIJ97MB9RwpQg0RMmXxk5N7LGA,1,"Absolutely dreadful and don‚Äôt know where to begin.  The food was almost inedible which isn‚Äôt unusual - but the beer was absolutely undrinkable and that is surely a crime for a Bavarian themed restaurant.  Staff lacked enthusiasm and were mostly disinterested.
Definitely a place to avoid"
ChIJ97MB9RwpQg0RMmXxk5N7LGA,5,"Good food, friendly waiters, great service. 100% recommended !!"
ChIJS6qJSmEpQg0RHt1p_a0ABuM,5,Very cozy and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. Extremely friendly service and food comes out fast. Food is very flavorful and great portion sizes.
ChIJS6qJSmEpQg0RHt1p_a0ABuM,5,"We came for a late lunch and they were very obliging. They even offered the menu del d√≠a even though we were late. We got 2 starters and one main with rice and naan, and had to take it away as we were so full! We got the chilli and garlic chicken and they made sure to check with us that we were happy with the spiciness taking it back to add more before we even started, showing they‚Äôre interested in their customers and their tastes. They also offered the most delicious spicy sauce as an extra as we love spice!"
ChIJS6qJSmEpQg0RHt1p_a0ABuM,5,Amazing food.  Super fast service but overall a great atmosphere!
ChIJS6qJSmEpQg0RHt1p_a0ABuM,2,Out of all Indian places i've ever been to this was the worst one. First of all zero people during lunch time should've been the first indicator. Butter naans looked and tasted like defrozen sand piles with no butter. Lamb rogan josh was basicaly a tomato soup with no taste and the lamb was tragic with an old beef-like odor. Very dissapointing.
ChIJS6qJSmEpQg0RHt1p_a0ABuM,5,"I ordered from Holi House yesterday and it was really good. I was craving good Indian food and they did not disappoint. I would definitely go back for more!
The person also who served me was super nice."
ChIJ79F3Va0pQg0RRNX190pbioI,1,Very sad restaurant. The waitress didn‚Äôt know much about the Chinese food so it was hard to get any relevant information about the dishes. The plates didn‚Äôt taste good at all. The design of the restaurant is beautiful and it was the reason why we entered. But we wouldn‚Äôt ever go back.
ChIJ79F3Va0pQg0RRNX190pbioI,4,"We went for a family lunch and it was good, great service and a nice seating area."
ChIJ79F3Va0pQg0RRNX190pbioI,4,Good and tasty food. Courteous attention and quick service.
ChIJ79F3Va0pQg0RRNX190pbioI,4,"Quite cozy and clean Chinese restaurant.
We went to eat and among other things, they have 2 types of menu.
Type A (9.90eu) and type B (11.90eu)
The 2 menus have 1 first to choose, 1 second to choose, 1 third to choose, 1 drink and 1 dessert. The difference between A and B is the quality of their dishes.
We ordered 1 menu A and 1 BWe ordered water to drink (0.5lfont vella) and a Coca Cola zero (33cl glass). They give you some olives and shrimp bread as protocol.
From the menu A we ordered spring roll, fried noodles and chicken with mushrooms.
From menu B we ordered mini rolls (3), KuBak (the best dish of the 6), and lemon chicken (we liked it better without lemon).
All quite delicious, large quantity on the plates.
The only bad thing is that they practically bring 6 dishes at the same time and we are not so used to eating with a table full of plates of food.
For dessert, balls of lemon and chocolate ice cream.

Very good option to change a little from typical Spanish food. I will return."
ChIJ79F3Va0pQg0RRNX190pbioI,3,"It used to be one of my favorite restaurants because of its proximity to home and the quality of its food and service. Very good prices and exquisite food. I had been visiting him for years since I was little and everything was always perfect. Currently they must have changed owners or chefs and the quality has dropped quite a bit, the dishes do not have the same special flavor as before and have become somewhat simple. Prices remain very competitive.
If they didn't lose what they got in their day, I would still go often."
ChIJ-ea7qFIoQg0Ru6oZPX4GeJU,4,"Cozy, easy to access, great patio, well priced, tasty well-proportioned meals and a friendly staff. No reason for it to not get 5 stars. ;"
ChIJ-ea7qFIoQg0Ru6oZPX4GeJU,4,Really nice traditional food at a good price. Service is fast even if the place s full.
ChIJ-ea7qFIoQg0Ru6oZPX4GeJU,5,"The food was delicious & the service was efficient, as well as pleasant."
ChIJ-ea7qFIoQg0Ru6oZPX4GeJU,3,"The typical bar of a lifetime with a very homely atmosphere and a wide variety of dishes. It should be noted that, for my taste, some type of sandwich or toast is missing from the menu, although we asked for it and they made it to us without any problem. In our case we ordered 1/2 portion of salad, 1/2 of cuttlefish and a loin, cheese and tomato sandwich, and the 3 spectacular dishes. The waiters were very helpful and friendly at all times. Everything plus 2 drinks cost us around ‚Ç¨35"
ChIJ-ea7qFIoQg0Ru6oZPX4GeJU,5,"Very well served, tasty food, a quiet atmosphere where you can enjoy your dish without disturbance ü•∞"
ChIJMQd9v1EoQg0ROwQA9K9--cw,5,"Have been here a few times as it is nearby the hospital we are staying at.  My initial draw was the cider which is great and served properly :). My first visit I ordered their award winning Cachopo and quickly understood it was for sharing and not for one.  The walls are adorned with medals and prizes for Cachopo competitions.  For those that have no idea what it is (as was my situation) it is like a massive beef schnitzel with cheese, mushroom peppers and or other fillings.  Absolutely delicious but simple food.

Have now tried the cider braised chorizo and the mini escalopes served with a pungent and tasty Asturian blue cheese sauce.

The decor is a tribute to the Spanish equivalent of the French Foreign legion (I think) which is unusual.

This is a place with great simple food done well in a comfortable environment where it is easy to feel at home"
ChIJMQd9v1EoQg0ROwQA9K9--cw,5,Super cozy atmosphere. Great food
ChIJMQd9v1EoQg0ROwQA9K9--cw,4,The food is amazing bad typical Asturian. The staff wsd also very nice and you feel like home :)
ChIJMQd9v1EoQg0ROwQA9K9--cw,4,"Nice cider, decent tapas, friendly staff, reasonable prices. If you're looking for an Asturian bar, or you're a fan of proper cider, this is better than most places in Madrid."
ChIJMQd9v1EoQg0ROwQA9K9--cw,4,"Good food.
The goat cheese was creamy and aromatic, not very salty.
Apple cider tasted good ."
ChIJAbg4fzApQg0RkfonzIdv-Vo,5,"Best in the area, excellent food and options, a great team and environment. You will love it as much as I did."
ChIJAbg4fzApQg0RkfonzIdv-Vo,4,"A great place for a snack lunch-dinner.
Good service and well-prepared dishes (some innovation that goes beyond the standard menu of 90% of the places is missing)
Nice place although somewhat noisy if it is full.
Very delicious salad and artichokes
Without a doubt, recommended, we will return"
ChIJAbg4fzApQg0RkfonzIdv-Vo,5,"We went to dinner and everything was great! The low loin 100% recommended. The calamari was divine (my son loved it) as was the tomato salad. The quality of each product is incredible. We were delighted with the guys' service, we will definitely return!!"
ChIJAbg4fzApQg0RkfonzIdv-Vo,5,"We ordered gildas, anchovies, artichokes and squid and we loved everything. It shows that the product is of good quality and the service was perfect. It's nice to have a place like this close to home, we will return for sure!"
ChIJAbg4fzApQg0RkfonzIdv-Vo,4,"Very delicious food and excellent service.
Large restaurant, covered terrace and pleasant atmosphere.
We had dinner with portions and we really liked them all: bravas, torreznos, broken eggs with Iberian ham, dogfish in adobo, low-carved loin and an assortment of desserts.
They have failed a couple of dishes that they did not have available (neither octopus nor squid).
Highly recommended. Reasonable price."
ChIJfQKqEXgpQg0RRqmzeZgevRE,1,"We ordered delivery and the experience was terrible. To begin with, the prices are too high for the quality of the burgers, which do not stand out in flavor or ingredients. But the worst thing was that part of the order did not arrive and, when we tried to solve it, we did not receive any response or compensation. Non-existent customer service. I will not repeat nor recommend it."
ChIJfQKqEXgpQg0RRqmzeZgevRE,5,"Both inside and outside they have a very good atmosphere. The terrace is a joy with the sun on your face. The attention is unbeatable, especially if LOLA assists you.  We will return for sure"
ChIJfQKqEXgpQg0RRqmzeZgevRE,1,Don't even think about ordering at home.  Request is missing and they neither respond nor solve
ChIJI9JrVCkpQg0RfNeMxojZ2ZU,5,Great food. Service was very good and the place is quite nice. The cachopo is giant and tasty. Great tarta de zanahoria.
ChIJI9JrVCkpQg0RfNeMxojZ2ZU,4,We have eaten very well. Quiet place. Very friendly staff. Both the rice and the seafood were very delicious. The decoration with great taste. Totally recommended.
ChIJI9JrVCkpQg0RfNeMxojZ2ZU,1,"Terrible menu.
The very bad soupy rice, bad flavor and rice that you can't get past... The meatballs are second to none edible..."
ChIJI9JrVCkpQg0RfNeMxojZ2ZU,2,"Today, two couples were eating a table of mini cachopos, 4, of which 2 were the same and 2 almost the same.... If you know about cachopos, don't go there, almost no filling and almost no flavor. They charge the bread at a golden price, without having asked for it, and 3 euros for a soft drink, locally, it wasn't even a terrace.
The attention was rather bad, the girl would be and not very happy. Come on, I won't repeat."
ChIJI9JrVCkpQg0RfNeMxojZ2ZU,5,"Very delicious food and excellent service. The waiters Brandon and Mailen were charming.
To repeat!!!"
ChIJ-esqm4YpQg0RAa2Q-2HO3gs,5,Good quality and attentive service
ChIJ-esqm4YpQg0RAa2Q-2HO3gs,4,"01/21/2023.
We have passed through the door countless times and never decided to enter!!!
From the outside it doesn't look like what you find later.
The service was slow, but the final product we were served was worth it.
The dessert took us even longer to wait than the arrival of the dishes, perhaps the reminder helped to get it to us.
We liked the place, the product, the price, enough to return, perhaps a crazy day of cooking led to the wait, but their cuisine and the quantity, quality and finally the price won us over.

The photos speak for themselves.

Until next time.
.
."
ChIJ-esqm4YpQg0RAa2Q-2HO3gs,5,"Excellent place, pleasant atmosphere and friendly waiters. The food was very good and the price is reasonable. The rice with lobster is very good. Of course, they take time to prepare (30-40 minutes) and of course, some starters first to wait for salad type, croquettes. The price is around 20 euros/person. We will definitely repeat!!"
ChIJ-esqm4YpQg0RAa2Q-2HO3gs,5,"I'm in this area for a few days for work, I wouldn't have found a better place than this to have lunch or dinner, close to where I live, friendly, friendly staff, a 10 üëç, the excellent dishes, well plated and abundant, you won't leave hungry, the price is very consistent with the quality and service.
I recommend it 100x100"
ChIJ-esqm4YpQg0RAa2Q-2HO3gs,3,"Edited: We return a week later, and they have changed the bread to a smaller one, which is no longer an Antequera-type muffin and which falls apart when you press the bread (as if it had been frozen for many days), and they have also raised the price to ‚Ç¨5.60. Personally, I didn't like that change in a single week, to lower quantity and quality and higher price.

We usually have breakfast at midday on weekends, muffin toast with serrano ham and coffee, the price is great at ‚Ç¨5.40 for 2 muffins and 2 coffees. The coffee must be Catunambu because of the advertising we see, personally I don't like that burnt aftertaste, the ham has a good flavor, the tub of tomato is a little scarce, but the Antequera-type muffin is great. It has an interior terrace with high and low tables, very well adapted to Covid with open windows and QR menu, we have not moved on to the interior lounge although it is the same size as the terrace. The service is correct, although it is true that every time we have gone we have been told that almost all the tables were reserved and it had to be a quick breakfast, which has surprised us, because in the half hour we spent from the time we sat down until we left, not much more customers have come."
ChIJMX99oRApQg0RFYEHJDqEsos,5,"A place where eating is a pleasure, there is a good atmosphere, very good food and the service is 10. I will repeat without a doubt it is highly recommended"
ChIJMX99oRApQg0RFYEHJDqEsos,5,Very good breakfasts. TOP quality. Super friendly waiters. It was his first day and it was full of people.
ChIJMX99oRApQg0RFYEHJDqEsos,5,We went on a trip to Madrid and really...what a great place!!! Excellent treatment and quality. A 10!!
ChIJMX99oRApQg0RFYEHJDqEsos,1,"Only one person serving, none cleaning the tables, you have to remove plates, cups, etc. and to pay you wait or leave without paying, lack of staff, bad service."
ChIJMX99oRApQg0RFYEHJDqEsos,5,"Perfect experience, good service and rich food, recommended."
ChIJCQXB0M0pQg0R4KY2iF0rJbM,5,"Dropped in because it's close to the hotel,  and very convenient.

The people were wonderfully welcoming.  It's clear we are tourists,  so I think they were glad that I have enough Spanish to communicate effectively,  and they were also glad that we know how things work.  We came in at the right time for lunch and we were not in a hurry.  We were almost the last to leave,  in fact.

The menu was excellent. I had garlic broccoli and then calamares while my partner had tortellini then veal. She had the ""three milks"" cake for dessert while I had coffee and pacharan (an old favorite of mine).

Will absolutely eat here again.

The bar is very stylish in tiles, too."
ChIJCQXB0M0pQg0R4KY2iF0rJbM,5,"Good, simple food at a reasonable price. Fantastic, fast, friendly waiters ! 100% recommended !!"
ChIJCQXB0M0pQg0R4KY2iF0rJbM,3,"We have come in to eat the daily menu. Great variety and sufficient quantity, a little short on the dessert pudding, but good. The paella was delicious, the chicken was good, the secret was a little dry although it was bathed in roquefort.
The large room and the friendly and fast service of the waiters"
ChIJCQXB0M0pQg0R4KY2iF0rJbM,1,"I have to give one star, because I don't recommend anyone who wants to have a nice time to go. The atmosphere is terrible, a noise that makes it impossible to have a conversation with the person next to you. Being close to the university area, it is full of screaming kids.

As for the food, possibly the saltiest I have ever eaten in my life. I added a photo where they dropped a potato in my salt dish.
A day later and I'm still thirsty, almost. I guess so that the kids drink more, get more drunk and shout more, and just thinking about it makes me want to never go near it again.

Regarding the service, no problems, on the contrary, very good service and super attentive, in that sense I leave it 5 stars."
ChIJCQXB0M0pQg0R4KY2iF0rJbM,1,"Painful.
None of the breakfasts we ordered have arrived well. The ham and tortilla toast, without ham. The avocado tomato and egg toast only had 4 pieces of avocado on one side. The American breakfast was brought wrong and after having touched it with my hands, they put the same plate on another table. The coffee with milk was brought without milk and the decaffeinated coffee was brought with caffeine. All of them without mentioning that it took them too long to bring us everything when the bar was half empty. Very high price for the quality of service, attention and food.
‚Ç¨3.20 for a black coffee!? A SHAME"
ChIJF55y808oQg0R4x31-ozdanM,5,Excellent every time I go. The staff is friendly and fast. The menu and the food is delicious

The drinks are incredible and the food of amazing taste. The staff is really friendly and happy to share a nice moment with you!"
ChIJX2MCOeApQg0R9-MPQS-ghS8,5,"The Green curry was a bit runny for my taste. Pad Thai was delicious, super rich. Highly recommendable!"

ChIJX2MCOeApQg0R9-MPQS-ghS8,5,Brand new thai restaurant with authentic flavor ‚ù§
ChIJKQJmCYMpQg0RCJ5SD5BXrdU,5,"This is about the fourth time I've been here.  Absolutely stellar food and wine.  I tried last week to get in but they were full.  There's a reason for that.

Today was ""just"" langostinos and zamburi√±os. And wine.

Oh so good.  The staff were run off their feet. So many people here because the food is so good."
ChIJKQJmCYMpQg0RCJ5SD5BXrdU,5,"Amazing staff and quick services with good prices, we toke the paella and i recommend it so much it was very delicious üòã üòã üòã"
ChIJKQJmCYMpQg0RCJ5SD5BXrdU,5,"I have been ordering the lunch menu for a couple of days as I live close by and every time it has been delicious! It is 12 euros and consists of two dishes, a drink and dessert. On Wednesdays they serve one of the best rabo de toro I have eaten :)"
ChIJKQJmCYMpQg0RCJ5SD5BXrdU,5,An amazing restaurant. Here I have tasted one of the best rices in my life. I will come again.
ChIJKQJmCYMpQg0RCJ5SD5BXrdU,5,Amazing food! The owner is very friendly and creates a great atmosphere :)
ChIJkb8ox5wpQg0RfXpR_L_Joqc,5,We have eaten wonderfully. A divine rice with lobster. Very good attention.
ChIJkb8ox5wpQg0RfXpR_L_Joqc,3,Good service and friendly.  Very cheap ‚Ç¨14.95.  Superior quality for the price.
ChIJkb8ox5wpQg0RfXpR_L_Joqc,5,"Restaurant with a very good quality-price ratio in its menu of the day, price 13.90. First, second, drink, dessert or coffee. The scrambled potatoes with torreznos are spectacular, as is the cheesecake. Recommended site."
ChIJkb8ox5wpQg0RfXpR_L_Joqc,1,"My goodness, thank goodness there is a hospital across the street.
Yesterday we went in to have a beer and, for 2 sad beers that were nothing to write home about, they charged us ‚Ç¨14.
Heart attack.
I won't come back.
Even at the German brewery down the street, they are cheaper, more generous and much better.
At least with variety to choose from"
ChIJkb8ox5wpQg0RfXpR_L_Joqc,3,"- Strong air current inside the premises.
- A lot of hustle and bustle.
- Lack of respectful attention.
- I order a plate of saut√©ed mushrooms and it turns out that they were boiled before grilling them. Really?"
ChIJN2z5YNUpQg0RhLcZwWWZGSo,1,"They don't exist... I called the number and asked if they're open, he said yes, but when I told him I can't find them and asked where they are he hung up and then rejected my subsequent calls. I thought maybe the pin on Google was wrong, but they must have closed down. Don't waste your time."
ChIJN2z5YNUpQg0RhLcZwWWZGSo,5,"The food was super delicious, since it is prepared in a very different way. Excellent service. I will return soon ü´°"
ChIJN2z5YNUpQg0RhLcZwWWZGSo,1,I didn't directly find it where it said it was located on maps.
ChIJN2z5YNUpQg0RhLcZwWWZGSo,5,"Highly recommended
It is different the bread is crispy Arabic meat is homemade not typical frozen homemade falafel
The best in Madrid without a doubt"
ChIJN2z5YNUpQg0RhLcZwWWZGSo,5,"It is not a typical kebap...it is Arabic shawarma where they prepare everything homemade, both the bread and the falafel, the sauce seems out of this world, highly recommended"
ChIJ2Xni9E8oQg0RlWd_tRDInfY,4,We went to eat the daily menu. It is a good castilian restaurant. You can eat a good daily menu for a amazing price or select from the meals list and you will be satisfied. Great and friendly serrvice
ChIJ2Xni9E8oQg0RlWd_tRDInfY,5,Delicious food!
ChIJ2Xni9E8oQg0RlWd_tRDInfY,5,"Incredible experience of a good steakhouse. Quality, price, attention. Top-notch meat, high-quality starters and excellent desserts."
ChIJ2Xni9E8oQg0RlWd_tRDInfY,5,"A timeless gem, this Spanish steakhouse.

The experience was, without a doubt, impeccable. The steak, without exaggeration, bordered on perfection: juicy, with an ideal point and accompanied by that unmistakable aroma that only traditional grilling can confer. On the other hand, the grilled vegetables were a revelation in themselves. Each bite offered a symphony of natural flavors, highlighted by a touch of smokiness that spoke of patience and mastery on the grill.

The service lived up to the legacy of the place, with staff attentive to their diners. This steakhouse not only offers food, but an experience that celebrates the roots of Spanish cuisine, leaving an indelible mark on the palate.

Without a doubt, a place to return to again and again."
ChIJ2Xni9E8oQg0RlWd_tRDInfY,4,Muy buen sitio para una comida familiar. Buen servicio y productos de calidad. Destacar√≠a la cecina y la morcilla.
ChIJ7zq4AlcpQg0RzxlHWr8naJE,5,"WAITER MONICA IS A PERSON WITH A LOT OF CHARISM AND HER ATTENTION AND SYMPATHY IS VERY GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS ALWAYS"
ChIJy6ajwfApQg0RoV4XCWoLVVI,2,"Cheap place with cheap food and totally crowded by young students. Not really worth a visit if you look for a good meal.
However, it's ok to have a beer and experience some horrible and unhealthy food. Young ambience but quality and concern for quality totally missing."
ChIJy6ajwfApQg0RoV4XCWoLVVI,3,"Big plates but low quality sometimes, don't try meat"
ChIJy6ajwfApQg0RoV4XCWoLVVI,4,A classic Madrile√±o restaurant! If you want to experience the real atmosphere of Spanish food culture this is the place. Very kind and patient staff and very attractive dishes!
ChIJy6ajwfApQg0RoV4XCWoLVVI,5,"Pretty crowded if you go at the lunch time, around 2 pm, but the food is really good, big portions and really cheap. A whole menu, 2 dishes, a drink and a dessert, is 10 euros."
ChIJy6ajwfApQg0RoV4XCWoLVVI,4,"Excellent quality-cost relationship. Perfect for students and colleague dinners or lunch. Extensive, tasty and cheap menu on weekdays. Noisy and crowded normally"
ChIJnXNVR5spQg0Rme2Rv3TPPJM,5,"I would give it 4 stars. Why? If you go to places like Gueyu Mar in Asturias o a Elkano en Getataria, you get a higher quality without the high prices, but ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs Madrid, I understand. Since  1911 is a product restaurant that‚Äôs trying to be an elevated restaurant, I ‚Äòd recommend others like Smoked Room in Madrid, Campero in Barbate or Pepe Vieira in Galicia‚Ä¶if you want a more sophisticated cuisine, before  Dessert 1911. Again, it‚Äôs not a bad place, it‚Äôs a great meal, but you don‚Äôt get good value here, it‚Äôs just a good meal, not a superb one like in afore mentioned places."
ChIJnXNVR5spQg0Rme2Rv3TPPJM,5,"My favorite restaurante in Madrid, a Michelin-starred restaurant with a Sol rating. The ambiance, decor, and service were exceptional. They made my birthday extra special by preparing a beautiful cake.

Highlights from the menu include the Ecugis Smoked Salmon, Viarigan Anchovy in Tempura, Classic Seafood Salad, Grilled Palamos Red Prawn, and the Baby White Bean Stew with Squid. Each dish was crafted with care, showcasing the freshest ingredients and expert preparation.

The restaurant offers a great selection of cheeses and desserts included in all menus, providing plenty of options to satisfy any palate. They also have a beautiful terrace."
ChIJnXNVR5spQg0Rme2Rv3TPPJM,5,"Desde 1911 is the best seafood experience I‚Äôve had in the past few years, bar none. It somehow manages to be expensive, yet an exceptionally good value. From the moment you step in, and a cart rolls by with freshly carved smoked salmon (top notch stuff, with so much flavour in the oils), you‚Äôll be laden with so much food that it‚Äôs impossible to walk out standing straight. But in a good way.

The simplest dishes were the most outstanding: the palamos prawns with exceptional tomalley, and the humble kokotxas with an ethereal batter, or the sweet shrimp with fresh peas. The sauces were sometimes too heavy to complement the taste of the seafood, such as in the lobster salpicon, but even those dishes were pretty decent. Then the fish main comes, a beautiful slab of grouper, sized like an entree for a 3 course meal.

Just when you think no more food can fit in, the largest cheese cart I‚Äôve ever seen rolls around. The staff will encourage you to take more, but one‚Äôs stomach protests. Then an equally dramatic dessert cart rolls around, with an offer you can‚Äôt refuse. I‚Äôd never been this happy while my stomach protested this much üòÜ.

Will definitely be back, hopefully before the inevitable price hikes after word gets out."
ChIJnXNVR5spQg0Rme2Rv3TPPJM,5,"Highly recommended! What a surprise to enter this beautifully-designed, modern space from an otherwise rundown backstreet. Outstanding seafood-based seasonal set menu from the Pescader√≠as Coru√±esas team. Excellent service from friendly staff. Must book far, far in advance!"
ChIJnXNVR5spQg0Rme2Rv3TPPJM,5,We loved this experience. And we like everything from restaurant‚Äôs design to delicious food . Cozy atmosphere and friendly personal . Thank you very much and will see soon . üíûüíû
ChIJvUD-N8kpQg0Rv5AQDXTRHoM,5,"Very good place, quality price and the best atmosphere ever!"
ChIJvUD-N8kpQg0Rv5AQDXTRHoM,2,"The calamari sandwich leaves a lot to be desired.
The waiter was fine, he advised me to assemble it because it was very big.
I advise the cook to save on bread and put half of it in the assembly and with that the four squids would not look ridiculous inside the bread.
It's unfortunate, but since I'm a positive person, I loved the time and the glass of wine. I don't know what rivera they gave me, but it was at its temperature and flavor point."
ChIJvUD-N8kpQg0Rv5AQDXTRHoM,5,"Modern bar. Young atmosphere. Good and abundant appetizers.
The sandwiches are huge. Good for 3 people"
ChIJvUD-N8kpQg0Rv5AQDXTRHoM,5,"QUE GRAN SERVICIO,empezando con el encargado FABIO con su atenci√≥n espectacular en barra y manejo de bandeja ,el sitio es muy acogedor con raciones muy abundantes menci√≥n honor√≠fica al PINCHO DE TORTILLA (ENSERIO TORTILLA 10/10)"
ChIJvUD-N8kpQg0Rv5AQDXTRHoM,5,"El Munay is an excellent bar for a good plan with friends, beer and tapas. The waiters are very friendly and very attentive; And they also serve you appetizers in abundance. If you're not careful, you'll be spoiled.

The draft beer isn't anything to write home about, but it's a real treat.

Mandatory weekly visit."
ChIJ7ad0Q60pQg0RP_AuquzArXU,5,"It has been a success. We have received great treatment. It is a place where you feel at home.
I imagine the cook is also the owner, and it shows that she does everything with great love.
The food was super delicious, and super large quantities.
Without a doubt, we will return.
Thank you for making us feel at home"
ChIJ7ad0Q60pQg0RP_AuquzArXU,5,"The bar-restaurant area is quite quiet, at least on the weekend.
It is the first time we have gone and they have treated us very well with great kindness.
The food is homemade and very delicious! üòã
We hope to return soon! üòä"
ChIJ7ad0Q60pQg0RP_AuquzArXU,5,"A place of 10 out of 10. We ate the menu of the day. And the dishes were delicious!!! Apart from the fact that it was served in quantity, the owner herself cooked them and the service was great."
ChIJ7ad0Q60pQg0RP_AuquzArXU,5,"Having toast with natural tomato for breakfast, various appetizers, fried eggs with hand-peeled potatoes, homemade food, what mini homemade potato omelettes!!!!...it's like being at home with friends. Its owner Carmen, a charming person, a pure Burgos native, will make you feel very comfortable.  If you're in a hurry, go for fast food...without fanfare, without bad faces, ask what's on for the day and relax."
ChIJ7ad0Q60pQg0RP_AuquzArXU,5,"We went to have a tapa, Carmen is incredible, very nice and kind (we met her that day), she made us an omelette on the spot and gave us a ham tapa and the omelette was EXQUISITE, very good, highly recommended"
ChIJjXl8clEoQg0RDMn-Z4RTtGE,5,the service here WAS PHENOMENAL!! they gave us croquettes on the house and shots! Quini (or Joaquin) was amazing he is so kind and sweet and was always there if we needed anything. He has a great spirit and work ethic he should be acknowledged! he got us olive oil for our bread too. I am definitely coming here again with friends. I came with my mom and sister and we had the menu of the day meal which was delicious and very much worth the price!! their batatas bravas are delicious!! the atmosphere was also lively and nice!
ChIJjXl8clEoQg0RDMn-Z4RTtGE,5,"Bar Manolo was a nice place to grab a few beers with tapas, and catch up with your friends. It's more of a local place rather than a touristic bar to hang out, but definitely enjoyable with friendly wait staff."
ChIJjXl8clEoQg0RDMn-Z4RTtGE,5,"Great Bar ! Friendly, good service, excellent Breakfast and Lunch. 100% recommendable !"
ChIJjXl8clEoQg0RDMn-Z4RTtGE,5,"Bottom line, for expats this is the best tapas tour you'll ever get in Madrid.
Always depends on preferences, but this is a popular great place to get drunk and flavor with affordable tapas. You gotta love this place."
ChIJjXl8clEoQg0RDMn-Z4RTtGE,5,If you want good authentic Spanish food and eat like the locals you need to come here. It is reasonably priced and the service is great.
ChIJ8XYGWkUoQg0ReWDiVAZLhSM,5,Their breakfast deals are incredible. Latte and 2 mini pastries for ‚Ç¨2.10. Insane
ChIJ8XYGWkUoQg0ReWDiVAZLhSM,1,The employees were very rude and not helpful at all. None of them spoke a word of English and did not make an effort to help us out. One employee preferred to watch the others work while she ignored clients. The food is overrated. Very disappointed as it looked nice online.
ChIJ8XYGWkUoQg0ReWDiVAZLhSM,5,"Great coffee, bread, and pastries. Staff was very friendly and patient even with my horrible Spanish."
ChIJ8XYGWkUoQg0ReWDiVAZLhSM,5,Friendly staff and great coffee/baked goods.
ChIJ8XYGWkUoQg0ReWDiVAZLhSM,4,Good atmosphere and amazing pastries
ChIJi7eLIq0pQg0R0wQyTpGGC2I,5,"It was a cocktail for 140.
Fresh salmon with avocado, little bowls of salad with artificial black caviar, green esparragus in serrano ham, little juicy meat pieces with sauce... everything was delicious"
ChIJi7eLIq0pQg0R0wQyTpGGC2I,5,the place is very beautiful and instagramable...food and desserts are delicious and the prices are reasonable...we will be back again because we had a good experience...service is topnotch with friendly and all smile staffs...
ChIJi7eLIq0pQg0R0wQyTpGGC2I,5,The foods are very good especially the arroz meloso with carabineros and also the American Cheescake and the Croquetas de jamon!I love it and surely we will go back!
ChIJi7eLIq0pQg0R0wQyTpGGC2I,5,"We had a great experience,we will be back soon for sure.the food are delicious and the service is very good.a nice place to chill and a good place to have a dinner with family and friends."
ChIJi7eLIq0pQg0R0wQyTpGGC2I,5,Incomparable
ChIJWdtvcjopQg0ReZI5JvLEsto,1,It's very small but the food is at least well made.
ChIJWdtvcjopQg0ReZI5JvLEsto,1,"We went because of the good reviews but the place seemed small and a bit shabby, in the bar there were those who ran it and a couple of their friends/acquaintances drinking, they welcomed us without any enthusiasm, they didn't have beer on tap and for food the only option they offered us was picapollo. We drank half a beer and left because we felt like we were in the way."
ChIJWdtvcjopQg0ReZI5JvLEsto,5,"Great, there is no other word to describe this place, an excellent atmosphere ideal for having a drink.
There is also the hookah option if you want to complement it with an afternoon with your colleagues and some beers.
All at a very good price.
Affordable and filling portions, there were 4 of us and with two portions we even had food left over.
We will return without a doubt."
ChIJWdtvcjopQg0ReZI5JvLEsto,5,"Well, I love this place because in addition to being well located and equipped for all types of audiences, the quality-price performance is very good. You eat and drink without realizing it. Let everyone come and check it out."
ChIJWdtvcjopQg0ReZI5JvLEsto,5,"Very good prices, excellent service, divine food"
ChIJdaq7U0UoQg0RW8IkFpRxq7w,3,Very fun. Decent dinner and a good show. Enjoyable bachelorette party. Advisable.
ChIJdaq7U0UoQg0RW8IkFpRxq7w,5,My friend and I are French and we wanted a private show as we don't know the areas we contacted this restaurant which welcomed us very well. We had a great time!!!
ChIJdaq7U0UoQg0RW8IkFpRxq7w,5,"We were a group of friends who were spending a few days in Madrid and the truth is that everything was great, both the food and the show. We will repeat the next time we return to Madrid"
ChIJdaq7U0UoQg0RW8IkFpRxq7w,5,"Very good show, very good atmosphere. we had a great time"
ChIJdaq7U0UoQg0RW8IkFpRxq7w,5,Great plan with friends or as a coupleüôå
ChIJFQwrPVMoQg0RDHewIwpkuy0,5,"Traditional bar, with the 3 B's: Cheap and Good Bar.

I love the tortilla they make!!!!! How delicious!!!"
ChIJFQwrPVMoQg0RDHewIwpkuy0,5,Advisable. If you are in the area go for lunch or dinner. Unbeatable price quality
ChIJFQwrPVMoQg0RDHewIwpkuy0,5,"Menchu's thing is from Extraterrestrials, the best in the neighborhood, the most honest, the nicest and her husband and children are super educated, respectful and VERY VERY GOOD PEOPLE"
ChIJFQwrPVMoQg0RDHewIwpkuy0,5,"A place to meet and get to know the people of the neighborhood, with a good breakfast (excellent) or a good sandwich or a good meal. All at a very good price served by ""Menchu"" and prepared by ""Juli√°n"" her husband. Great professionals and better people."
ChIJFQwrPVMoQg0RDHewIwpkuy0,5,"A traditional neighborhood bar, run for a few years by a Chinese family, very nice, very friendly, and some more from the neighborhood. Frequented by all types of typical neighborhood fauna: older, small and medium-sized. Breakfasts, sandwiches, traditional mixed dishes, good and economical, as well as some typical dishes from the place of origin and recipes from the good cook. They serve an aperitif with each drink. It's a shame that it doesn't have a terrace, but everything else makes up for it."
ChIJTSfS0vEpQg0RUs0EEYpQlYk,5,"The menu has enough variety to make you go more than once.
The sushi tastes super fresh and the rice was really good.
I‚Äôll definitely go back!"
ChIJTSfS0vEpQg0RUs0EEYpQlYk,5,Perfect for a quick lunch! Good price and quality
ChIJTSfS0vEpQg0RUs0EEYpQlYk,3,Basic . Fresh ingredientes though
ChIJTSfS0vEpQg0RUs0EEYpQlYk,5,"The food was perfect, we were the only table and even so the waiters are not the fastest, but the place and the taste of everything was perfect"
ChIJTSfS0vEpQg0RUs0EEYpQlYk,5,"Acceptable price quality.
""Trusted"" sushi place in the area. At least the best one I know"
ChIJnVWy_k8oQg0RmurtjCFNz8c,5,"Cozy restaurant with good, friendly service and tasty food. Have eaten here regularly on Fridays for lunch and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere. It's hidden from the hustle and bustle of the street."
ChIJnVWy_k8oQg0RmurtjCFNz8c,4,"A very nice atmosphere, the price of breakfast was ‚Ç¨3 per person. The quality of the food is good, the portion size could be improved and the staff is friendly, but being so full they got a little lost and the tables were dirty. Value for money and recommended."
ChIJnVWy_k8oQg0RmurtjCFNz8c,4,"We ordered some croissants and they were very good, the girl who served us was a little unfriendly as soon as we requested the menu because we didn't fancy the executive menu"
ChIJnVWy_k8oQg0RmurtjCFNz8c,5,"The ‚Ç¨13.50 menu is very good!!!... The service is very good because they serve you quickly, you barely have to wait between one dish and another."
ChIJnVWy_k8oQg0RmurtjCFNz8c,5,It is located within the shopping galleries of the Parque de las Naciones shopping center. It consists of two floors and has a very cozy and elegant atmosphere. I went to eat the lunch menu which costs about ‚Ç¨10.5 and they change it daily. They serve quickly and the food was delicious.
ChIJRydMvq0pQg0RvEO29O1UGyY,3,"The food was fine but the service was extremely rude. The waiter acted as he was insulted the whole time and was surprised when we asked for the menu to order an extra plate. Not a cozy or friendly place to relax with your friends.

With a small change in the attitude, Dehesa could be a great place."
ChIJRydMvq0pQg0RvEO29O1UGyY,4,"Is a human experience, they have their goods and their bass, hence you will need more than one visit to feel it for both, food and service."
ChIJRydMvq0pQg0RvEO29O1UGyY,2,Had a quick breakfast on the go. Not much of a place at the time I was there.
ChIJRydMvq0pQg0RvEO29O1UGyY,5,Nice place to grab a Beer in summer!
ChIJRydMvq0pQg0RvEO29O1UGyY,4,Best quality/price ratio in Bellasvistas.
ChIJo_v_mP4oQg0REG4nlFS-sj4,3,"Good food and slow service, but I will repeat."
ChIJo_v_mP4oQg0REG4nlFS-sj4,5,Great classic Asturian food.
ChIJo_v_mP4oQg0REG4nlFS-sj4,2,"We went to the restaurant on a gift voucher received. The quality of the food was banal, like in a student cafeteria or a factory cantina. The service much too rushed, as if they were hoping to have us gone, although the restaurant was not crowded. The atmosphere of the restaurant was one of an upmarket one, but the content not. The choices offered on the voucher were very limited and were recited by the waiter rather than chosing from the menu (which means we could not even know how the choices filled the value of the gift voucher)."
ChIJo_v_mP4oQg0REG4nlFS-sj4,4,Great service and nice food.
ChIJo_v_mP4oQg0REG4nlFS-sj4,5,One of my favorite places for Asturias food in Madrid. Yummy food. Tasty. The service is excellent.  They also have a highchair for babies/toddlers.
ChIJg6zEuP8oQg0RD0og3N8k5E4,4,Like this place. The set up theme is not too flashy.  Food it‚Äôs great place is clean and the staff is easy going.
ChIJg6zEuP8oQg0RD0og3N8k5E4,5,Really loved the food. The lady is very courteous. The prices are also very justifiable. Good place for a group or to unwind after a long day!
ChIJg6zEuP8oQg0RD0og3N8k5E4,5,"Good place, friendly stuff, fast service. Not expensive."
ChIJg6zEuP8oQg0RD0og3N8k5E4,5,Traditional Mexican food. You must try the Tamal!
ChIJg6zEuP8oQg0RD0og3N8k5E4,5,Cheap and delicious Mexican food.
ChIJC96cmf4oQg0RG6CoFOkwoDg,4,"Solid Spanish restaurant, the food was very good, the service was attentive, the quantities were generous

If you don‚Äôt eat fish please be aware that there are fewer options to choose from, especially for the tapas and starter dishes

The garlic steak was amazing

The wine choice was also solid"
ChIJC96cmf4oQg0RG6CoFOkwoDg,5,I wasn‚Äôt able to take many photos of the food because they looked so tempting. The service was phenomenal. This has been my third time coming to this place and it‚Äôs worth going back to eat lunch or dinner.
ChIJC96cmf4oQg0RG6CoFOkwoDg,5,The food was incredibly flavorful and every bite was a definitely a treat. The fish was fresh and everything else tasted really good. Would come back!
ChIJC96cmf4oQg0RG6CoFOkwoDg,5,"My friend and I were eager to experience a good paella after couple of bad experiences with it. And we found ‚Äúthe restaurant‚Äù for it, which is this. We loved the paella as well as the octopus and calamari they served us. Also, Driss, the managing chef, made sure our meal was the best possible. Kudos Driss and ÿØŸäŸÖÿß ŸÖÿ∫ÿ±ÿ® üòâ."
ChIJC96cmf4oQg0RG6CoFOkwoDg,5,"*Humble American tourist perspective*

This was our first meal in Madrid, and it exceeded expectations. Great service and food. And it‚Äôs Pinoy-owned! We had calamari, octopus, and seabream. Don‚Äôt sleep on this one :)"
ChIJL5efT1MoQg0RWlD24SPVgms,5,"There is a very specific atmosphere of local cuisine and hospitality.  Many interesting photographs with autographs of celebrities as the history of the establishment.  delicious food, especially jamon and steak, are ideal for me.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Thank you!"
ChIJL5efT1MoQg0RWlD24SPVgms,5,"Fantastic Basque restaurant. Their Brand Brandada of Cod is sublime. Attention to detail, great service and fantastic food!"
ChIJL5efT1MoQg0RWlD24SPVgms,5,"Fabulous restaurant. Great service,  great food.  Cannot fault it ."
ChIJL5efT1MoQg0RWlD24SPVgms,4,"Good food, nice service, one of the few cider places in the area. Quite reasonable. I highly recommend the sopa de mariscos"
ChIJL5efT1MoQg0RWlD24SPVgms,5,"Very nice place and food. Meat is very good a tasty. Actual Basque coucine. I have known this place for years, and quality hasnt changed."
ChIJ7Yc_CVUoQg0RS2AJQu2qsXI,5,"The food is absolutely delicious & the service is impeccable. The atmosphere makes you feel right at home. I loved it & highly recommended it. Great for if you're single, in a couples, groups of friends or family."
ChIJ7Yc_CVUoQg0RS2AJQu2qsXI,5,Amazing food! Delicious mfongo and stewed chicken. Hearty portions and the waiters were super friendly! Will definitely go back!
ChIJ7Yc_CVUoQg0RS2AJQu2qsXI,5,Amazing Dominican food! And great service!
ChIJ7Yc_CVUoQg0RS2AJQu2qsXI,5,Delicious food. Pico pollo is amazing. Went in with no clue about Domincan food but was pleasantly surprised.  Would recommend!
ChIJ7Yc_CVUoQg0RS2AJQu2qsXI,5,This place was everything the staff was friendly too! I will returnü§üüèøüï∫üíØ
ChIJsWsoTKopQg0RqVzqQaxl6do,5,"Everything was good. I like the seafood, it‚Äôs so fresh and tasty. The service is very good as well. I will definitely go back."
ChIJsWsoTKopQg0RqVzqQaxl6do,5,"A local favourite serving good-quality Galician fare. The octopus here is some of the best in Madrid. Recommendations include other seafood such as the zamburi√±as (scallops), as well as the chorizo, sweetbreads, and fish and meat dishes on the griddle served with tasty garnishes of padr√≥n peppers. Wash it all down with the ribeiro wine served in a ceramic jug with bowls to sip from. It looks and feels like a friendly tasca and it's always buzzing. The staff are the life of the bar and give it its personality - especially Juan who is guaranteed to entertain. The only thing to be aware of is that this is a cash-only place, so be sure to take out cash in advance as there are only a couple of atms nearby."
ChIJsWsoTKopQg0RqVzqQaxl6do,5,"It was delicious, home made food and good wine. We will definitely come back!üç∑üç≤"
ChIJsWsoTKopQg0RqVzqQaxl6do,4,"We had four dishes for four people and it was definitely enough.

- Patatas bravas: crispy, tasty but too much sauce. The sauce had a very smokey flavour.
- Chorizo: extremely salty but it tastes like your good old spanish chorizo.
- Tortilla: good, unique texture.
- Calamares: pretty good.

If you want to try Spanish food, this is a good place to do it. They have a lot of authentic options and the portions are very big. Food-price ratio is good! We paid ‚Ç¨60 for four dishes, five drinks and a happy stomach.

Personally I disliked the interior but our waiter was very enthusiastic and genuine, so that made the experience better. This bar is not near the centre so there aren‚Äôt many tourists. We left ‚Ç¨5 tip."
ChIJsWsoTKopQg0RqVzqQaxl6do,4,"Really great service, the pulpos a la gallega were delicious. We ordered some filloas for dessert and they were good but not great.

Beware that they do not accept credit cards!!! If you make the same mistake as I did, the waiter will point you to the closest ATM."
ChIJ5R0eWqopQg0R9cV84zj3fzs,3,I order on glovo 1 bucket of wings worth 10. Euro and barbeque pizza. But to my surprsed the 1 bucket of wings is like 1 bucket of potato with 6 pcs of wings ‚Ä¶ you need look at your employee. I order it november 7 .. the order arived 23:10 like that‚Ä¶ I need explanation why the 1 bucket chicket is 6 pcs wings and a lot of potato fries?
ChIJ5R0eWqopQg0R9cV84zj3fzs,5,"Small place, but very nice & accommodating employees."
ChIJ5R0eWqopQg0R9cV84zj3fzs,5,"Once I figured out how to order online, it was quick, simple and great. Gust√≥ mucho."

ChIJU60Ny_8oQg0Rq0KkymYjA6E,5,"The ambience is 100 points! It feels like Tokyo in all its aspects.

I would definitely recommend the ‚ÄúJapanese table‚Äù over the bar or the regular table, but be ready to take your shoes off!

Food is incredible fresh and with items that you would only find in a true Japanese restaurant.

Service is top, and they speak English. And overall I would highly recommend it for a special occasion or date night!

We went of my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and he loved it.

We ordered a LOT! (We were 4 ppl) Appetizers, mains, beers and desserts and we paid ‚Ç¨45 per person. But if we were to order like normal people it would have probably been around 30/35."
ChIJU60Ny_8oQg0Rq0KkymYjA6E,5,"A delightful evening. It feels like you are walking into a small corner in Tokyo. The decoration, staff, and overall vibe feels genuine. Drinks and food were all freshly made and delicious. Sushi was great, with thicker pieces of fish than I am used to which was a pleasant surprise. The curry noodles were powerful and tasty. The teriyaki rice and fish dish was great as well. All deserts were home made. We tried the green tea ice cream and passion fruit mousse. Both were a good choice to end the service. Finally, cold sake was great. Overall a very decent restaurant that I would recommend."
ChIJU60Ny_8oQg0Rq0KkymYjA6E,5,"No wonder the place is always busy! Simple izakaya style and excellent food, together with a very professional service. We specially liked the sushi options, the tempurah and the teriyaki, and the daily special salmon tartar was superb. Pricewise, we found it reasonable."
ChIJU60Ny_8oQg0Rq0KkymYjA6E,5,The most authentic Japanese restaurant in Madrid
ChIJU60Ny_8oQg0Rq0KkymYjA6E,5,"Been to this place 2 weeks back to back and it just got better, delicious food and charming staff! Sitting on the floor is also a different experience (they also have regular tables). Everything I tried so far is great! Plan to keep eating here regularly."
ChIJQ3yho1QoQg0RGPuhp1LbqEE,5,A place in the hood with fresh seafood and friendly service.
ChIJQ3yho1QoQg0RGPuhp1LbqEE,5,"Best place in Madrid for fish and shellfish. We had gambas a la plancha- delicious and pulpo a la gallega, merluza. Our favorite restaurant in Madrid. Would totally recommend."
ChIJQ3yho1QoQg0RGPuhp1LbqEE,5,"Amazing, unexpected restaurant which offers us top quality fish,  extraordinary crabs, fresh green peppers, octopus and delicious desserts. The place is very small and rhe decoration too traditional, but every dessert was outrageous."
ChIJQ3yho1QoQg0RGPuhp1LbqEE,5,"Excellent quality, good price... and service was even better.
Poasibly the best Galician restaurant in town"

ChIJLaZF__8oQg0RegN9Ihl26I8,4,"KFC Sol in Madrid offers a convenient and quick dining option right in the heart of the city. Located near the bustling Puerta del Sol, it provides the familiar taste of KFC's signature fried chicken, crispy fries, and other favorites. The restaurant is clean, with efficient service, and a comfortable seating area to relax after exploring the area. While it‚Äôs a fast-food spot, its central location makes it a great choice for a quick meal amid the vibrant energy of Sol."
ChIJLaZF__8oQg0RegN9Ihl26I8,5,Very good service here thanks Rahul
ChIJLaZF__8oQg0RegN9Ihl26I8,5,service is very good and food is great and fresh. Ijaz was very helpful

ChIJLaZF__8oQg0RegN9Ihl26I8,5,Very good sevice here thank you (Marisol)
ChIJr8Q2vFQoQg0RqlZd5VHTcXc,4,Beer was really good and on point with supplying great off the beaten path beers. Artisanal beers from across Spain and other countries. Ambiance is great and the wings were really good! Very very tasty. Beers were relatively expensive but expected considering the variety and origin of all the artisanal beers.
ChIJr8Q2vFQoQg0RqlZd5VHTcXc,5,"Possibly the best bar for craft beer (cerveza artesana) in Madrid. They have probably 200 different bottles to choose from, and also a great selection of craft beer on tap (both Spanish & more traditional offerings from other countries). Very big place also, with an enormous bar area, and also a separate place in the back which is more of a restaurant. The bar tender was a legit craft beer expert, which was awesome. I wish I didn‚Äôt live so far away, otherwise I would come every weekend. A definite paradise for beer geeks. Bizat!"
ChIJr8Q2vFQoQg0RqlZd5VHTcXc,5,"From what I've been told, one of the few bars that have decent glute-free beer, so we decided to hang out here for a bit with a friend who is gluten intolerant.

The bartender was very nice and easy to talk to, he gave good recommendations on beer. We ended up also having mead, for which he also provided excellent recommendations.

Prices were very good for craft beer, would love to come back if I was around in Madrid."
ChIJr8Q2vFQoQg0RqlZd5VHTcXc,5,"If you love beer, this is paradise"
ChIJr8Q2vFQoQg0RqlZd5VHTcXc,5,"Funky little beer bar with loads of bottles and taps.  Seating outside and plenty of room inside.  The tapas (free with each drink) are nothing special, but I was there for the beer and it is special."
ChIJy3FLylQoQg0RdcZCDHV6fkM,3,Good
ChIJy3FLylQoQg0RdcZCDHV6fkM,5,"Neighborhood bar, the usual ones, fresh beer and delicious food with adequate and affordable prices for everyone. He treated, close and friendly. Always a success üëçüèª"
ChIJy3FLylQoQg0RdcZCDHV6fkM,2,"The food is delicious but the service leaves a lot to be desired. There are times when THERE IS NO ONE AT THE BAR. Or they are talking with friends, or taking care of a baby... And the smoke extraction systems could very well be improved. You always come out with a croquette smell."
ChIJy3FLylQoQg0RdcZCDHV6fkM,4,"They give you good tapas every time you order a drink, whether alcohol or soft drink. The attention is good because they are attentive to you. The atmosphere is calm but a little annoying because the place is small. Of course, the decoration is cool."
ChIJy3FLylQoQg0RdcZCDHV6fkM,5,"Good value for money, without a doubt the best paella I have eaten in Madrid, family atmosphere, service of 10, it is also a good place to go for tapas.

For paella you have to reserve!"
ChIJJxPYRVYoQg0RN2G1AtddA3U,5,"No thrills neighbourhood spot with jamon, jamon and more jamon. We were very much to made feel welcomed and enjoyed our jamon bocadillos and a few beers. No nonsense quick service."
ChIJJxPYRVYoQg0RN2G1AtddA3U,4,"Good place to eat a sandwich, share some light plates or drink some beer without been expensive."
ChIJJxPYRVYoQg0RN2G1AtddA3U,5,Great vibes and good food and cerveza

ChIJJxPYRVYoQg0RN2G1AtddA3U,5,"Tipical bar/restaurant in Madrid, the sandwiches are tasty and hot, it was a nice discover on the way to the city center. Good to get a quick and satisfying meal!"
ChIJdUnxVVMoQg0RNPU8dv_jxcs,5,Wonderful gluten free meal at a good value with attentive service. My spouse is not gluten free and found the meal to be delicious as well. This is a must visit if you are a Celiac and visiting Madrid.
ChIJdUnxVVMoQg0RNPU8dv_jxcs,5,"Really good gluten free restaurant. I went there with my boyfriend who has celiac's disease and my brother. All the dishes are GF and they have GF bread too. The good was really good. The grilled veggies were amazing. The server was very attentive and asked us if any of us needed to eat gluten free and told us that everything from the menu is gluten free. I would say that the prices are maybe a bit on the high side but the food is really good and they are a 100% gluten free restaurant and that gives us peace of mind, to know that there is no cross contamination. Highly recommended"
ChIJdUnxVVMoQg0RNPU8dv_jxcs,1,The kitchen was closed. Hungry celiacs arriving at 15:52. Opening hours on google until 17:00.
ChIJdUnxVVMoQg0RNPU8dv_jxcs,5,We have eaten here twice during our 4 day break in Madrid. Once later afternoon when we enjoyed the menu del dia (which was excellent value ) and once at night for the al a carte. Both times the food and service were very good. It is such a treat as a coeliac to be able to eat anything at all on the menu. We will be back next time we visit your beautiful city
ChIJdUnxVVMoQg0RNPU8dv_jxcs,5,"Amazing food. 100% gluten-free. Very good quantity.

Had the red tuna, which was fresh from the day. It‚Äôs one of the best dishes I‚Äôve had in some time. Would recommend for sure, and not just for gluten intolerant people.

Also, very good service."
ChIJVW9MQlYoQg0Rzeu1pD-p36I,1,"They serve this teared part breadings and skins and also small parts,, very bad quality of cooking unlike other branches. My last purchase of this branch"
ChIJVW9MQlYoQg0Rzeu1pD-p36I,5,I love the chicken spicy it's finger licking good üëçüëç happy tummy.
ChIJVW9MQlYoQg0Rzeu1pD-p36I,4,"I wish kid meals would be better at including the toy. And I wish the entrance space was better because it can be impossible to bring a stroller or wheelchair in and try to use the line as just isn't enough space... But they do have an  elevator. Downside, trying to use the toilets with a stroller in tow is nearly impossible."
ChIJVW9MQlYoQg0Rzeu1pD-p36I,1,"Good is good! But crew is not nice, very slow service,cashier is not pleasant to the client...
Bad üòû"
ChIJVW9MQlYoQg0Rzeu1pD-p36I,2,"Everytime I order from this stupid restaurant there is a missing item, I can‚Äôt believe how stupid the workers are there, they are not focused, idiots"
ChIJw1yl5lUoQg0R7Coj4Jhoub0,1,The most lack of hygiene I‚Äôve ever seen. It takes too long (more than 20 mins) to get the order
ChIJw1yl5lUoQg0R7Coj4Jhoub0,5,I love this burger king. Specially they hav high chair for kids
ChIJw1yl5lUoQg0R7Coj4Jhoub0,1,"The service here is the slowest I have ever seen. The only good point is that you can rest here on hot days. The aircondition works well an you can enjoy endless cold drinks for just the price of one. Short extra note: Many beggars entering and asking for money.

EDIT 18.07.2022: The branch is also not realy clean. The whole second floor is a total mess, including the toilets. They don't realy care about cleaning."
ChIJw1yl5lUoQg0R7Coj4Jhoub0,1,"30+ minutes waiting. You're better off running off to another burger king, just not this establishment"
ChIJw1yl5lUoQg0R7Coj4Jhoub0,1,I stopped by just for an ice cone for me and my kid and after 8 minutes they even didn't bother to take my payment. The store located in Orense is miles away with better customer service. Not coming back to this one ever again.
ChIJvfnbFlYoQg0Rvt0I4Sdafio,2,"Dont have service to the tables, the outside inside, restrooms dirty as f... Bad service on counter."
ChIJvfnbFlYoQg0Rvt0I4Sdafio,5,It's good and recommendable for tomar algo its quite not expensive.
ChIJvfnbFlYoQg0Rvt0I4Sdafio,5,Great prices and amazing food!!
ChIJvfnbFlYoQg0Rvt0I4Sdafio,3,"I‚Äôve seen better restaurants of the same chain. The place needs a little bit of renovation and cleaning works, cracks on the tiles, a massive hole on the floor that almost made my husband fall, sticky stools and tables, dirty walls... the list goes on.

The staff looks quite rushed and I think they focused too much on serving the customers quickly rather than giving a friendly service.

The food was correct and the prices decent, In my opinion the drinks prices are really good.

Recommendable for a beer or two."
ChIJvfnbFlYoQg0Rvt0I4Sdafio,2,"The 100 Montaditos in Cuatro Caminos is horrible. It was very unhigienic, and smells like a very old place. I went to the toilet and the smell was very horrible that it would make you vomit. The floor was sticky and seems like no one is taking care of the place. Don't getme wrong, although I loved going to Montaditos because of the cheap beer and food they have, the experience I had in Cuatro Caminos changed my mind really. I won't go back to a place where I'll feel uncomfortable."
ChIJZ-uDZ_8oQg0RvFKwkn-GFds,5,"It is without a doubt, one of the best take-home kitchens that I know, they have friendly, willing and very professional staff.
If I had to make a list of foods from this place, I wouldn't know where to start because everything is very good and super homemade, in short, I recommend it üíØ x üíØ"
ChIJZ-uDZ_8oQg0RvFKwkn-GFds,3,"Open during regular hours. Small prepared food stand, at the entrance of the market, with a good hand in the kitchen, a wide variety of prepared dishes, fast and good service, reasonable price. I recommend."
ChIJZ-uDZ_8oQg0RvFKwkn-GFds,3,"The food is very delicious. But when you buy something by weight, for example paella ‚Ç¨14 per kilo, they do not discount the weight of the container so they always charge you about 30 or 40 cents more, since you are charging for the container at the price of prepared food. They should deduct the weight of the container before weighing what they are going to give you and they don't. Otherwise, as I say, the food is quite good, a little expensive but this is Madrid and I have already said that they overcharge you. Without that surcharge it wouldn't be cheap either but..."
ChIJZ-uDZ_8oQg0RvFKwkn-GFds,2,The food is very delicious but the sales assistant in the morning who is not Filipino is very unfriendly and unpleasant. You ask her and it is difficult for her to answer.
ChIJZ-uDZ_8oQg0RvFKwkn-GFds,3,"The product is good, I bought pasta salad, stuffed peppers and fried milk, the receipt is confusing because they give you several receipts, I appreciate that they are clearer.
I asked the lady who served the reason for the two tickets and her response was that she had not washed the taperts, which are plastic and not reused. I put the review because I think the product deserves better service."
ChIJ9fqX-lUoQg0R1wBDekYrbbs,5,"Our friends from Venezuela showed us this place and I could eat here every day for the rest of my life. We had the normal varieties with chicken/cheese, beans/cheese and  mixed minced beef. As well as the fresh juices and imported drinks from Venezual made this the highlight of the food for Spain."
ChIJ9fqX-lUoQg0R1wBDekYrbbs,4,"Amazing, original empanadas from Venezuela! I wish my tummmy had space for more! It may be a little chaotic and seating is very limited but definitely worth the experience!"
ChIJ9fqX-lUoQg0R1wBDekYrbbs,4,Delicious fried Venezuelan empanadas. I had them with caz√≥n. Street food. Authentic.
ChIJ9fqX-lUoQg0R1wBDekYrbbs,5,"Authentic Venezuelan food. A Venezuelan friend brought me here and says it's the best Venezuelan food in Madrid. Anything you get will be fantastic, especially the pabell√≥n!!"

ChIJrcROUv8oQg0RPt5mrVKmnN0,5,First quality fish & seafood. Fantastic place and variety.
ChIJrcROUv8oQg0RPt5mrVKmnN0,1,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND RESPONSE
Our experience and treatment of what happened has been very unfortunate. Last weekend (02/05/2022) my father ordered some seafood (crab, shrimp and cockles) and specifically, an ox that cost ‚Ç¨82.43, since they recommended that it be ‚ÄúGalician‚Äù as it was worth it.
What was our great disappointment, that when we opened the ox, water and water began to come out, and it was completely empty (I post photos, it appears empty because there was nothing inside). You will understand what our disappointment was about it because we couldn't try it, it was bad. I don't know what the problem was, whether it was poor cooking or poor quality of the product, but I assure you that for the money it had cost, the ‚Äúdisappointment‚Äù was total.
My father (an older man) saved part of the body and the legs to take to the Seafood Restaurant. Okay, he's not a regular customer, but he has bought there from time to time. What was the great disappointment that you didn't give him any answer. It really seems regrettable to me, that you have little vision towards a client who is telling you the truth, that you have given him a product that has cost very expensive, and the minimum is that you have a detail towards the client that you have not had. For my part, neither I nor anyone in my family will ever return to buy anything from your business.

Thank you for responding, but what I cannot tolerate with your comment is that you call us liars. I find it incredible, the same thing you told my father. Do you really think that an 89-year-old man is going to bring you something we ate? Your response is regrettable, really!"
ChIJrcROUv8oQg0RPt5mrVKmnN0,5,Right now it is the best fishmonger on the market in terms of variety and quality. The clerks know their job and have no problem preparing the goods however the client wants. It is a pleasure to see their skill with those tremendous knives and the delicacy with which they fillet the fish. Everything with its origin label so that we understand the price. The prices? According to quality. There are no pesos!
ChIJrcROUv8oQg0RPt5mrVKmnN0,1,"We specifically asked for G0 size shrimp and they gave us G2 at the price of G0. For those who don't know, G0 is the largest shrimp and decreases in number until it reaches the rice paddy. Same with cockles. In addition, I have arrived home and weighed the things because when I saw it it seemed little compared to other purchases I have made and in fact they have given us a lower amount than what they have charged us. What a pity that I didn't decide to watch it there, TeleMadrid was just there to make their faces red live."
ChIJrcROUv8oQg0RPt5mrVKmnN0,5,"Very good fish and seafood at any time of the year, very attentive and professional clerks.
They know how to prepare the quality product they have. Here is a sample of what was bought there and made at home üòÄüëåüëåüí™üí™üëèüëèüòãüòãü•Çü•Ç"
ChIJR5nkzVcoQg0Rdj-TjVQwo3o,5,"This place is just fantastic, the food was excellente, i had the Chipirones a la placha, i ordred a seconde as they was tasty, decoretion, service, clenless.....everything was excellent.
I will definitively back .
Thanks for the service"
ChIJR5nkzVcoQg0Rdj-TjVQwo3o,3,"Good staff and service. Ordered scallop, entrecot and gambas. I asked the waitress to have all dishes at the same time (there for lunch and not many customers). Brought us scallop and gambas first then had to wait 10 minutes for the beef. Then everything was little bit overcooked, asked my beef rare and it came medium done. Hopefully the quality of the beef was really good so even overcooked it was tasty and not too chewy."
ChIJR5nkzVcoQg0Rdj-TjVQwo3o,4,"Cool place in Santa Engracia street. Has very cozy inside seating area and many tables outside for a meal or drink.
Fresh tapas with each drink.
Friendly customer service.
Well connected, close to metro Cuatro caminos.
Next time will be for a meal, so I can tell more."
ChIJR5nkzVcoQg0Rdj-TjVQwo3o,5,Great staff and the food is amazing! I had an entry dish of salmon and avocado that was great! The deserts even better...I had a coconut pudin (looked like a flan) excellent!
ChIJR5nkzVcoQg0Rdj-TjVQwo3o,2,"I was passing by,just wanted to have a beer ,staff wasn't very friendly,could be even described as  rude"
ChIJi6ZqbP8oQg0RIKEAU8Tl5oI,5,"Our meal at Midang was absolutely fantastic. We tried the Bibimbap and the Yukejang and both we're satisfyingly delicious and filling. We also would like to commend Marvin, who provided us with the best service. He was very helpful to us during the whole time. I definitely recommend this restaurant and we'll be back for sure."
ChIJi6ZqbP8oQg0RIKEAU8Tl5oI,5,"When people ask for a good Korean restaurant in Madrid, I always recommend this restaurant. Recently, I also took my group of friends, it was great. All were delicious and successful! Probably, spiciness was adjusted to mild level, but taste was just good!

One thing, this restaurant doesn't have many tables and it is better to reserve your place first before going!"
ChIJi6ZqbP8oQg0RIKEAU8Tl5oI,5,"The restaurant is small, but the feeling is cozy and conformable. I came here twice, the experience was really good. All the dishes we tried are delicious and authentic. The waiter is really friendly and helpful, and the owner is really professional on doing the table service."
ChIJi6ZqbP8oQg0RIKEAU8Tl5oI,5,"Eating here will momentarily transport you to Korea. The flavors are authentic and the service is top notch.

They have a menu del dia for lunch with a variety of the most popular Korean dishes as well as a few that isn‚Äôt as easy to find. You can‚Äôt go wrong with any of the options. Nothing is overly spicy and like any good Korean place, you‚Äôll get side dishes with your meal."
ChIJi6ZqbP8oQg0RIKEAU8Tl5oI,4,"I had serious doubts about this rating because of the service, which is not up to the level of the authenticity and the quality of the food.
We visited in the company of a Korean friend, hence we knew what and how to order. The culture fosters sharing therefore we ordered several dishes, and it was very difficult to choose a favorite because they were all delicious.
The place is very small, six tables maximum, so be sure to book in advance as it gets crowded very quickly.
While the owner was very on top of his business, the waiter was clearly unexperienced. We had to ask for basics (napkins and chop-sticks) several times.
The food is totally 5 stars deserving, but the service is widely improvable."
ChIJiyNSRVUoQg0RZ6ecRbTlums,5,"We have come at 1pm on Wednesday and had tried the menu del dia. There were 3 options for the main and second dishes and we went with fish ceviche for the first one and pollo salteado for the second. Both were huge and delicious, we though we would have go be rolled out of the restaurant üòâThe menu also includes a desert or coffee and a drink (juice, water, etc.) all for 13 euros. Highly recommended to all those who enjoy Peruvian food ü•∞"
ChIJiyNSRVUoQg0RZ6ecRbTlums,4,We ate dinner here and had a couple of dishes. The food was nice and had good flavour. The TVs on were a bit distracting but apart from that it was nice. The Pisco Sour was a bit to sweet for our taste.
ChIJiyNSRVUoQg0RZ6ecRbTlums,4,We found a very cozy and neat restaurant. We had potatos for start and ceviche as main. Good portions and overall price/quailty.
ChIJiyNSRVUoQg0RZ6ecRbTlums,5,Delicious Peruvian dishes. The Ceviche and  Pescado a lo macho is top.
ChIJiyNSRVUoQg0RZ6ecRbTlums,5,I had pescado a lo macho and it was very delicious. It was tender and the grave was very tasty. The stuff was friendly as well. So far it is the restaurant I enjoyed the most in Madrid.
ChIJ3QSxmv8oQg0RP1SzgmlihOw,4,"The dishes we generously served although rather oily. The prices were reasonable. I recommend the menestra, it was quite good."
ChIJ3QSxmv8oQg0RP1SzgmlihOw,5,"This was one of the best meals I've had in Madrid. Lots of food for not a lot of money, and oh my god full of flavors. It was an amazing, amazing experience. I highly recommend."
ChIJ3QSxmv8oQg0RP1SzgmlihOw,5,"Great food and friendly staff, I‚Äôll be sure to come back again for more humitas"

ChIJn-CjIP8oQg0R0ZB6B4wGz_U,5,"We had lunch at this Italian restaurant today and were very pleased with everything. The prices are excellent for the quality of the food, the service was quick and friendly, and the dishes were delicious and professionally made ‚Äî it felt like we were in Italy, right in the middle of Madrid. The atmosphere was very welcoming. The lasagna was fantastic, and the pasta was made with fresh ingredients. Highly recommended!"
ChIJn-CjIP8oQg0R0ZB6B4wGz_U,5,One of the best pizza places in Madrid. Truly italian with great customer service
ChIJn-CjIP8oQg0R0ZB6B4wGz_U,5,"Amazing pizza! Feels really authentic. It‚Äôs necessary to book, otherwise you might be disappointed."
ChIJn-CjIP8oQg0R0ZB6B4wGz_U,5,"The best pizza I ever ate!
I went to Madrid for 2 weeks and I ate here 6 times. It is one of the best discoveries I found in Madrid.
The pizza is super delicious, not very dry and not very juicy, it is perfectly balanced! The price is super good compared to the high quality of the food and service.
The staff are very friendly, they also speak English fluently so I had no problem communicating with them.
I highly recommend the place, make sure to make a reservation or you will end up missing the best pizza in Madrid!"
ChIJn-CjIP8oQg0R0ZB6B4wGz_U,5,"Best Italian food in Madrid. Family owned, great attentive service, and the food is always spot on. Love going for lunch because their menu is a great deal. Highly suggest to anyone looking for authentic Italian food in Madrid."
ChIJbcpG4A8pQg0RtwxMu93bdvo,2,This review is not against the employees but it‚Äôs for the system because i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good for michely to be working all by herself when her store is full.
ChIJbcpG4A8pQg0RtwxMu93bdvo,5,"I really enjoyed the service, even tho michely was alone she was super kind"
ChIJbcpG4A8pQg0RtwxMu93bdvo,5,Best frozen yogurt in town! Thank you Michely!
ChIJbcpG4A8pQg0RtwxMu93bdvo,2,"I arrived very excited to refill the llaovasitos I carried all day, like I have in many other llao llaos.

I was told that due to hygiene they couldn't refill them and it would be the same price either way.

The price doesn't matter but having to waste a glass pot every time seems unnecessary, I go for that option precisely because it's the most sustainable. It can't be a hygiene issue if in other llaollaos I'm allowed and none of the equipment touches the glass.

Safe to say my interaction removed any joy I had for the treat and I ended up not getting anything."
ChIJbcpG4A8pQg0RtwxMu93bdvo,5,Super tasty and Michely is very kind!
ChIJOzENEaspQg0R6klAPbIsB5Y,5,"On our first visit we were very pleased with their food. Being from the US we were not exactly sure as to what we ordered but when it arrived it was very good, hot, and freshly cooked."
ChIJOzENEaspQg0R6klAPbIsB5Y,5,"Great portions, good food"
ChIJOzENEaspQg0R6klAPbIsB5Y,5,"Very good menu of the day and good price 100% recommended, very nice waiter"
ChIJOzENEaspQg0R6klAPbIsB5Y,5,"It has become a reference for us in the neighborhood due to the professionalism of the waiter who manages it, attentive and friendly, and for the tapas that accompany the beers, which are all very complete and delicious. We ordered dogfish and cuttlefish and it was fabulous. Great quality-price, and the thirds at ‚Ç¨2.70."
ChIJOzENEaspQg0R6klAPbIsB5Y,5,"The service attitude is very good, the tortilla is delicious, the cafe con leche is also very good, and the price is cheap"
ChIJgzilsqopQg0RmUmWbJoFufo,4,Cool.
ChIJgzilsqopQg0RmUmWbJoFufo,2,"Very poor cleaning, the bathrooms are terrible, a very strong smell of pee comes out when you sit down and eat. It doesn't seem to me that the place is so neglected."
ChIJgzilsqopQg0RmUmWbJoFufo,5,"A stop at work to have a coffee, it looks like a very nice place and the service is very good, with the coffee they gave me a little detail"
ChIJgzilsqopQg0RmUmWbJoFufo,5,It is a cute and small place. Very well attended and with an excellent menu of Honduran and Nicaraguan dishes. Super competitive prices
ChIJgzilsqopQg0RmUmWbJoFufo,5,"Very good place, very friendly and good attention, especially the attention of the fine lady"
ChIJaWIQ-P8oQg0RpkJ7Iji6ta4,3,"I actually liked the food and the staff here, but the value was much lower than surrounding restaurants. The prices are simply way more expensive than the food deserves."
ChIJaWIQ-P8oQg0RpkJ7Iji6ta4,4,Very flavorful Peruvian food.
ChIJaWIQ-P8oQg0RpkJ7Iji6ta4,5,Great peruvian food
ChIJaWIQ-P8oQg0RpkJ7Iji6ta4,1,Go somewhere else
ChIJaWIQ-P8oQg0RpkJ7Iji6ta4,5,"A traditional food house but in Peruvian. Generous portions. Homemade food. Kind attention. Highly recommended. I will return for sure

Note. Seeing some reviews we must move on different levels of reality. Clearly one of them is for Lelos... there are people who you can't get from Horcher (although they are more from Vips and KFC)"
ChIJnVOWw_goQg0ReJKfx1ZYAsw,5,"I absolutely adore this restaurant for anyone eager to enjoy some Persian cuisine in Madrid!

The food is simply delightful, the service is warm and welcoming, and the ambiance fills the air with joy, creating a truly wonderful dining experience.

Sure, there‚Äôs a bit of a challenge with the lack of parking spots nearby, but trust me, the scrumptious food and delightful atmosphere make every step of the walk absolutely worthwhile!

If you‚Äôre craving some incredible Persian dishes, this place is a must-visit! You‚Äôll leave with a big smile and a happy heart!"
ChIJnVOWw_goQg0ReJKfx1ZYAsw,5,"Food was really good. Staff were friendly and offered recommendations from the menu which is nice.

We were recommended a starter to share and a platter for two, which we ordered. Within five minutes of the starter arriving (we were only halfway through), the main arrived. Then we were asked if we were finished when we still had food on our plates. We felt like we were quite rushed even though the restaurant was not busy. If I could offer advice, it would be to slow down a bit and allow us to finish our course before bringing the next one. We were in and out within 40 minutes and this took the shine off a great restaurant.

This issue is not enough to give less than five stars, however, as the food was fantastic and the restaurant was lovely. Staff were friendly, but need to slow down a bit."
ChIJnVOWw_goQg0ReJKfx1ZYAsw,5,"Very cozy place with great authentic Iranian food. Loved the service, price is great and the quality of the food is top üî•"
ChIJnVOWw_goQg0ReJKfx1ZYAsw,5,"Delicious Persian Comfort Food in Madrid!

Had a great meal at Mr Kabab the food really hit the spot! The highlight was definitely the Chelo Kabab Kubideh: perfectly seasoned, juicy, and served with fluffy saffron rice. Every bite was full of flavor and reminded me of traditional Persian cooking done right.
Portions were generous, and the service was fast and friendly. If you‚Äôre craving authentic kababs in Madrid, this place is worth the visit!"
ChIJnVOWw_goQg0ReJKfx1ZYAsw,5,"If you‚Äôre looking for traditional Iranian dishes, this is the place to come in Madrid. Besides the great service, which was so welcoming and friendly, the ambiance had true Persian taste, and so did the food. The meat was tender, rice cooked well, and tea and dessert was just perfect. I will definitely come back the next time I come to Madrid and will recommend this restaurant to family and friends."
ChIJCy_gaf8oQg0RywZT1YTzX7g,5,"Great Chinese food and friendly staff. Hot towels are provided before your meal, nice touch. The Peking Duck is excellent, crunchy on the outside and flavorful and tender on the inside. Good for groups and family dining!"
ChIJCy_gaf8oQg0RywZT1YTzX7g,1,Ordered twice for delivery and twice there was something missing from it. They won't get a third chance. Will never use again.
ChIJCy_gaf8oQg0RywZT1YTzX7g,5,"Excellent food and service. For the quality you get, a very good price. Recomended"
ChIJCy_gaf8oQg0RywZT1YTzX7g,5,"Thank you for taking care our meals' the food Was' delicious, We have returned' after months' and the service and food are excellent. Thank you."
ChIJCy_gaf8oQg0RywZT1YTzX7g,5,"Great, fresh food. Cheap, straightforward and recommended."
ChIJrWg34_4oQg0RxaqTKQXEk2c,2,"If you order food from this place you have to keep in mind that it will bother you the entire next day, with constant stomach pain and going to the service every now and then. Of course, the displeasure comes cheap."
ChIJrWg34_4oQg0RxaqTKQXEk2c,3,"I ordered glovo at home.

Average food quality.
Average quantity served.
Price of dishes medium high.

Overall rating 5/10.

I will not repeat."
ChIJrWg34_4oQg0RxaqTKQXEk2c,1,"And I put 1 because there is no less, we ordered food by the balloon and the food was super full of fat, reheated everything. The truth is I never ask for more."
ChIJrWg34_4oQg0RxaqTKQXEk2c,1,Pitiful place! The food is not recommended at all! Unhygienic and bad for two days. A shame of a place
ChIJrWg34_4oQg0RxaqTKQXEk2c,5,"Fast, and very good quality-price ratio! üòä"
ChIJ5R0eWqopQg0RWGUOZ98mGEU,3,"I might be spoiled from eating pizza in New Jersey but I have yet to find good pizza here.

The bottom of the pizza was very floppy and it took a long time to receive the food"
ChIJ5R0eWqopQg0RWGUOZ98mGEU,2,Pizza hut was better in my memory than it actually was unfortunately
ChIJ5R0eWqopQg0RWGUOZ98mGEU,5,"I sincerely love the service, food, and atmosphere. It was one of my best pizza experiences. Thank you for the amazing service."
ChIJ5R0eWqopQg0RWGUOZ98mGEU,3,I hope Artificial intelligence replaces the customer service here!
ChIJ5R0eWqopQg0RWGUOZ98mGEU,2,"Hard to get in touch with staff when needed, no chilli powder or Parmesan cheese available.
The dispenser soda had a horrible taste, even when I changed to another flavor."
ChIJLxySuOMoQg0RY0zjs5wi8A8,5,"Our Airbnb host recommended this place as one of the best places to experience the traditional cuisine of Madrid. The food was served well, delicious, and our host was very friendly. We were traveling with our 5yo daughter and he made an effort to make her smile and enjoy her meal."
ChIJLxySuOMoQg0RY0zjs5wi8A8,5,"The best cocido in Madrid, ES with elegant dining in a traditional Spanish bar (not a typical US bar) this is a restaurant serving the best Spain has to offer in cocido (stew) that has chorizo, chicken, beef and ham hock (cured) with a ton of chickpeas as well as veggies-potatoes, carrots, cabbage, and a type of matzoh ball. It‚Äôs all super delicious and very Spanish. For dessert I loved the rice pudding. Make a reservation for sure especially closer to 1300 hours."
ChIJLxySuOMoQg0RY0zjs5wi8A8,2,"Stay away from this place if you're not a local. They obviously hate tourists and they're not trying to hide it. The waitress told us that is forbidden to share food with someone at your table which is in itself an absurdity. If you end up here by accident, like we did, try and keep your spirits up while the staff keeps giving you an evil eye for daring to come in. Food was ok, altough a bit overpriced. The main dish is a tasty soup from assorted meats which they later serve as a main dish, cooked low and slow."
ChIJLxySuOMoQg0RY0zjs5wi8A8,3,"We have been dining at La Daniela for years, ordering our same favorite plates at the same ‚Äúdead‚Äù time before the lunch crowds swarm. Now, one particular gentleman has begun insisting that we cannot order those very dishes. Why? Because the restaurant makes more money on their mainstream, assembly-line platters at such a ‚Äúbusy time of day‚Äù. Bear in mind we are the only clients in an empty restaurant. You could hear a pin drop in the cocido. Any exceptions to this new, seemingly arbitrary rule are framed as generous favors to the client. Fail to find room for dessert? That‚Äôs cue for another two minutes of client-shaming, cloaked in unfunny jokes.

I'll refrain from identifying the particular server. It'll be evident the moment you owe him one for allowing you to dine at this chain restaurant."
ChIJLxySuOMoQg0RY0zjs5wi8A8,5,"Awesome Cocido Madrileno. If you don't eat Cocido Madrileno don't go. Other options are not as good and tapas are not allowed at the table only at the bar (very tiny bar area). Our waitress was rude most of the time but we just had fun with her bad attitude (she was not local, her Spanish wasn't that good)."
ChIJLZa6df4oQg0RAXwd1zRtESI,3,"Tapas bar in the ground floor, which I recommended, and more formal restaurant in the basement, both serving  classic  food from Asturias, in the north of Spain. Relevant wine list  including a wide range of sherry and international references"
ChIJLZa6df4oQg0RAXwd1zRtESI,5,The stuffed calamar dish we had was superb and unexpected for such a straightforward sounding dish. Everything else was solid. I would go back for that dish alone
ChIJLZa6df4oQg0RAXwd1zRtESI,5,Always a great experience. You hardly can go wrong with their tapas. Wine list of great level. Service professional and attentive.
ChIJLZa6df4oQg0RAXwd1zRtESI,5,"Excellent burrata, fine wine, incredible meat, pisto con bacalao is a must have and their original tapas-pizza!"
ChIJLZa6df4oQg0RAXwd1zRtESI,4,Lovely place to have a drink  and pinchos. Everything is excellent
ChIJE9LpiPwoQg0R1gFh6IGZAHM,4,"I popped in here for some food and drinks, not expecting much, I assumed it would just be another fast food place, but I have to say we were impressed. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The main let downs were a slightly convoluted ordering system; you use a QR barcode to view the menu and build your order but can't then submit or pay via that; you have to call a person over to copy the order down, which kind of defeats the point. There was also a slight issue where we were told we could sit at one table but were then told to move to another table, although this may have  been miscommunication due to the language barrier. Overall these were minor niggles and I'll likely keep an eye out next time I'm hungry."
ChIJE9LpiPwoQg0R1gFh6IGZAHM,4,"Thank you Maricar for serving me üëç Excellent service üëè Almost every weekend I‚Äôm here since I live nearby and I can stay as long as I want, no rush. Next time, I‚Äôll upload some pictures."
ChIJE9LpiPwoQg0R1gFh6IGZAHM,5,We tried their new Sticky Ribs & Pollo Oriental bowl and it was really savoury! The server (named Martin) is very kind & accommodating. We will be backüòä
ChIJE9LpiPwoQg0R1gFh6IGZAHM,5,"Funny go into a bookstore to get to a restaurant. But same great review and before on VIPS. Huge fan.
Bonus: USB-charging at the table"
ChIJE9LpiPwoQg0R1gFh6IGZAHM,1,Currently sitting in front of a cold burger and chips. Massively disappointing experience from a group that should know better. Cramped seats
ChIJxVk6uQIpQg0R1Q3b5rnMXaw,4,"Great beer (6‚Ç¨ each), I fully recommend Los Nachos (they put a lot of cheese at the bottom and on top). Good music and some nights they have a DJ!"
ChIJxVk6uQIpQg0R1Q3b5rnMXaw,4,"Nice Irish Pub for Madrid.  They advertise as a Sports Bar, they could use a few more TVs.

I had a Caesar Salad, which was very good.

Th beer was cold, I could tell they clean their lines, which is a bonus.

I'll go back again."
ChIJxVk6uQIpQg0R1Q3b5rnMXaw,4,"Best pub in the north part of Madrid.
Music is good. Place looks nice and gets packed during weekend. Good vibe!!"
ChIJxVk6uQIpQg0R1Q3b5rnMXaw,4,"The atmosphere of this place is fantastic! I enjoyed the music, and when I attended live concerts there, they were great. The drinks were good, the prices acceptable, and the decor is pretty cool. The Irish Rover is perfect for a group get-together. Where they have some room for improvement is in the food. While it was not bad, it was nothing memorable, nothing special."
ChIJxVk6uQIpQg0R1Q3b5rnMXaw,5,Andrea is the best! She always treats us so well and gets us a table even when there isn‚Äôt one available. Will always be going back
ChIJq5NnLvwoQg0Rl5aE7y_TpNA,5,"Absolutely great experience at O‚ÄôPazo. The staff are impeccably attentive and professional. The food is exceptionally fresh. The standout for me was the sole‚Äîit was divine. Perfectly cooked, not too hard or soft. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy outstanding seafood in Madrid."
ChIJq5NnLvwoQg0Rl5aE7y_TpNA,5,"An incredible place for seafood!  We ordered the clams and variety of shrimp, prawn and langoustine and each one was phenomenal.  Every bite was plump, tasted super fresh, seasoned just right and cooked to perfection.

The wine menu had good variety and was reasonably priced; we enjoyed two different bottles of Albari√±o.

Would definitely go back!"
ChIJq5NnLvwoQg0Rl5aE7y_TpNA,5,"Really amazing food. We looked for a seafood restaurant in Madrid.

We loved sole fish. It was super good. The ceviche was also amazing. Tuna tartare was good as well.

I highly recommend everything here.
Complementary almond cookie after the meal was also yummy

However, price was on the higher side"
ChIJq5NnLvwoQg0Rl5aE7y_TpNA,5,"Excellent food, especially the red prawn and the goose barnacles"
ChIJq5NnLvwoQg0Rl5aE7y_TpNA,5,Outside of the atmosphere being a little dated this place is definitely worth the price. Every dish from the Caviar to steak tartare to the incredible fish (I mean absolutely incredible fish served for 2 as the only option on the fish menu served for two) was outstanding! The wine list is incredible and well priced. Plus the portions are BIG!! Finally a place that is highly priced but actually gives you decent portions for the cost...so happy I went here! Reality is overall for what you get it's very well priced
ChIJ46ORp-MoQg0R27RFeWrM9II,5,"Lateral was suggested to us by Canopy Hilton Hotel, which is just around the corner as a good traditional Spanish restaurant that is good and not too expensive. We really enjoyed the food, artichokes being our favourite (me and my 10 year old daughter) and the drinks were great. Best of all was the service, most waiters were Spanish speaking unlike me but one waitress Andrea was super helpful with her great English and sunny personality. She made some great food suggestions and was very swift and helpful. We had a great time and came back the next night for more! Highly recommend this restaurant!"
ChIJ46ORp-MoQg0R27RFeWrM9II,4,"Had a great evening dinning in! Portions were a bit smaller than expected but cost was ok. Food was good, and because price is not too expensive it's a great option overall.

The service of Ironelis was absolutely wonderful! She recommended the chocolate cheesecake and that one was by far the best dessert."
ChIJ46ORp-MoQg0R27RFeWrM9II,5,"Zineb was a wonderful waitress and agreed to served us, as we spoke little Spanish. She was super patient with us and also was very great at communicating! The food was amazing, especially the boneless ribs. We even ordered seconds! Thank you Zineb for the wonderful service, if we ever return to Spain, we will request you!"
ChIJ46ORp-MoQg0R27RFeWrM9II,4,"Nice place for a quick lunch. The dishes are small but the service is fast, so it's a good option for getting back to the office quickly.
We had battered aubergines and grilled octopus. Everything was delicious. The staff was very attentive and helpful explaining the dishes."
ChIJ46ORp-MoQg0R27RFeWrM9II,5,The food was nice and Andrea was a fantastic waitress. Very attentive and took a lot of time to translate the menu for us and to give us recommendations.
ChIJsTX_X_0oQg0RQcrNSo307Pk,5,"Great place! Very close to the club & disco area, it was nice to have some beer & billiards before going out. Waiters are nice & the music fits the moment (changes from 80s-90s rock to more actual genres later in the night)."
ChIJsTX_X_0oQg0RQcrNSo307Pk,5,Super cool staff. Pool table. Darts. Cheap drinks. Music. The perfect dive bar if you like dive bars! üòâ
ChIJsTX_X_0oQg0RQcrNSo307Pk,5,"It's a nice night pub, they play Spanish pop music, they have a pool table, darts... And the drinks are not that expensive. Cool place"
ChIJsTX_X_0oQg0RQcrNSo307Pk,4,"A great local pub with darts, pool, nice outside setting, and cheap beer."
ChIJsTX_X_0oQg0RQcrNSo307Pk,4,"Real atmosphere of a pub, good music and good beer for people used to English pubs"
ChIJk-Fpwf0oQg0RDCznajQiIh8,4,Very good menu of the day for less than 10 euros. First I had a scrambled blood sausage that was really good. Juicy and very well prepared. The treatment is very pleasant and they have their parishioners who are known to come daily. The Chinese from the Asian restaurant next door... were eating there.
ChIJL_UQhPsoQg0ReM12R3u5H5o,5,Very good service especially the waiters Paul and Adrie. And the foods are excellent as always.
ChIJL_UQhPsoQg0ReM12R3u5H5o,5,"Always loved their food. The service has been pretty good. Paul, Edgar and Dumar have been really helpful!"
ChIJL_UQhPsoQg0ReM12R3u5H5o,3,Spendid decoration and very friendly waiter. The foods were in big portion but tasted not that good though. The pasta were ok but the sauce that they put them in were below average. However the atmosphere and service saved the experience.
ChIJL_UQhPsoQg0ReM12R3u5H5o,5,"Very good food, delicious. I had fish salad, I loved it.
Tagliatelle and ravioli also splendid.
Customer service very fast and attentive.
Will be back and recommend!"
ChIJL_UQhPsoQg0ReM12R3u5H5o,5,"The establishment is in a very good location. It is a full-service restaurant with a nice atmosphere and amenities. *For English Only speaking patrons - please be aware that the paper menu is in Espa√±ol only, and most of the staff do not speak English, those that try to speak English they do so with some trepidation, so be kind. Wonderful place, so if you are in this area of Madrid you should visit."
ChIJYUbPMx0pQg0RBmq6Ox_FZyM,5,"The service is great, the food is delicious and with good variety, you should try everything!"
ChIJYUbPMx0pQg0RBmq6Ox_FZyM,5,"Good value for money. Two courses plus dessert for ‚Ç¨14 at lunch. Paella was really good, chicken in black beer a bit boring. The chocolate ice cream dessert was a small prefabricated tub. But all in all a lot of food for not a lot of money. Nice outdoor seating area too."
ChIJYUbPMx0pQg0RBmq6Ox_FZyM,1,"Very bad service. If you are a tourist (like me and family) don't ever go. They don't want tourists , they speak only Spanish and the worst thing is how to charge you more. Above all , first came main plate and at the end we had bread. Ridiculous"
ChIJYUbPMx0pQg0RBmq6Ox_FZyM,5,"Casual ""deli"" with draft beer, coffee, and jamon.  Great place for a snack or a light meal!"
ChIJYUbPMx0pQg0RBmq6Ox_FZyM,3,"I've been here only once in December 2017.
Indeed authentic relaxed place for tapas and a glass of wine. Nothing fancy. Price is reasonable as far as you stay within the men√π. As soon as you make a change babam! Staff not particularly kind, it seems like they know how famous they are.
I'd go back mainly for the jam√≥n iberico which was indeed good."
ChIJjyX92-MoQg0RshfX31JiF1c,5,"Very close to Real Madrid‚Äôs stadium right in the city center, lies this trendy modern tradition restaurant. It is a bit pricey but food is really good and there are plenty of options. I tried the bloody mary cocktail and it was delicious."
ChIJjyX92-MoQg0RshfX31JiF1c,5,Nice food! Comfortable environment! Like!
ChIJjyX92-MoQg0RshfX31JiF1c,1,"Incompetent in several instances.

Usually, I don't write bad reviews, but I have to make an exception for this one.

1. The quality of the food is really miserable, yet the prices are very high.

None of the meats were cooked to the degree requested. None of the meats came with seasoning whatsoever. It appears that some random dude just threw meat in the pan and then served it. Call me old-fashioned, but I really don't enjoy chewing on a raw piece of meat and paying 25‚Ç¨ for it.

Three of us ordered fries, none of which came with ANY salt. Seriously, I had better fries at McDonald's. How can a restaurant mess up one of the most basic foods in the world? The recipe is really not that complex. Fun fact: It's potatoes, oil, salt.

The prices were above average, the quality way below average.

2. They do not have a card for beverages or drinks.

The waiter could not provide any information whatsoever. I literally had to guess my way through the menu. Seriously, the number one thing ANY business should have is a list of the items they offer. How can anyone mess this up?

3. The waiter was very unfriendly.

He encountered every friendly question with an arrogant and unfriendly attitude. If you don't like to work with people, don't become a waiter.

Never go to this restaurant. I'd rather order a subway sandwich than go back to this establishment."
ChIJjyX92-MoQg0RshfX31JiF1c,4,Nice place. The food a bit too salty. A bit unfriendly to non local people.
ChIJjyX92-MoQg0RshfX31JiF1c,5,Went for lunch and got the three course menu which was very reasonably priced. The soup/salad was amazing. We got the swordfish steak and fried pork chops both of which were good not great. Overall for what we paid this place was well worth the visit.
ChIJaSqZcwIpQg0RpgNdMyw3H6U,4,"It is a restaurant where you can feel very comfortable, as if you were in your living room.
The food is delicious, they have a menu for ‚Ç¨14 with a wide variety of dishes that will leave you very happy.
The flavor is delicious and the customer service is impeccable. Plus they don't make you wait long between courses. Both the waiter, who clearly has extensive experience in the sector, and the kitchen were very efficient.
Perhaps as a drawback I could say that it has a somewhat expensive daily menu."
ChIJaSqZcwIpQg0RpgNdMyw3H6U,5,"Excellent homemade and market food. Care and dedication in daily preparations of a large list of dishes. Fresh and varied salads. Clean and odor-free. You can wear a suit because there are no underdresses or overalls. The tables are clean, and with cloth tablecloths for your single use. Napkins and cutlery in the same line and rigor. If you can pay a little more, this is the right place for your daily lunch menu. On Sundays and holidays you find family gatherings and small celebrations. Ideal to go as a couple. The staff serves with courtesy and very good presence. Totally recommended."
ChIJaSqZcwIpQg0RpgNdMyw3H6U,5,"It is one of my reference food houses. Where lunch will never make you feel bad because it has the stew that preserves what is endearing, what you have always felt, what you will not forget. Personal attention is also at that level. You can almost say that they take care of you. Kindness, attention... For me, a reference site"
ChIJaSqZcwIpQg0RpgNdMyw3H6U,5,"I was at a couple of work lunches. It has space above and below. Offers many firsts and seconds. We let them know and they had vegetarian and vegan dishes. As a vegan option, I recommend the rice with vegetables, it was spectacular. Something they could improve: giving a list of the dishes on the menu. They sing them to you, there are too many to remember and choose. It would make life easier."
ChIJaSqZcwIpQg0RpgNdMyw3H6U,5,"Homemade cuisine of very good quality and at a very reasonable price. Some very good varied starters: serrano ham, cod croquettes and potato fritters with salmon, and a very successful second: a gra meatball stuffed with bacon and foie with potatoes and a very good sauce."
ChIJbZniO_woQg0RMH8Wpo16CMs,5,"We were here for a conference, and looked up ‚Äòtapas bars‚Äô within walking distance of our hotel. This place showed up with great menu pictures so we went there, and had a fantastic meal, great vibe, lovely service. Authentic Spanish food and just delicious."
ChIJbZniO_woQg0RMH8Wpo16CMs,5,"Lovely place, very welcoming, amazing food! Love the Angus beef!"
ChIJbZniO_woQg0RMH8Wpo16CMs,4,"Short business trip to Madrid and happened to eat here by chance, but so glad we did. Food was good, and was most impressed that the staff didn‚Äôt try to suggest we needed more. So: great food, honest staff, and very patient with two British guys who spoke almost no Spanish between them."
ChIJbZniO_woQg0RMH8Wpo16CMs,5,"We had the best experience tonight. The food was amazing. We had a variety of dishes, of which our favorite was the Patatas Revolconas con Torreznos de Soria (cracklings with mashed potatoes - chef‚Äôs kiss!) but by far our best experience was with our server. He was generous, funny, helpful to Americans with limited Spanish, and he made our night. Definitely recommend!"
ChIJbZniO_woQg0RMH8Wpo16CMs,4,"Just breakfast, and it was nothing exceptional, but it warmed up my body. The waitress tried their best, but the hour before a concert, they are overwhelmed. I don't see any clear solution for that, so my evaluation has been 4 stars."
ChIJtUXhu_4oQg0Rtf11Qmlsvnw,5,The waiter's behavior is very good and the food is very tasty. recommended üìç
ChIJtUXhu_4oQg0Rtf11Qmlsvnw,5,Very good üëç
ChIJtUXhu_4oQg0Rtf11Qmlsvnw,1,I know kebabs are supposed to be poor but it really is the pits here.  Filthy
ChIJtUXhu_4oQg0Rtf11Qmlsvnw,2,Very dirty place. Kebap was average.
ChIJtUXhu_4oQg0Rtf11Qmlsvnw,1,Dirty place and unhealthy food.
ChIJnxQvjPgoQg0RFLqwj1wR3bw,2,Passable Peruvian Food. The service is very attentive and friendly. But the food lacks quality and flavour. This is also a tavern/small restaurant and the prices are very high considering the ambiance.
ChIJnxQvjPgoQg0RFLqwj1wR3bw,5,"Absolutely delicious Peruvian food!
10/10 for everything. Fod, quality, service, the ambience, just amazing, see you very soon!"
ChIJnxQvjPgoQg0RFLqwj1wR3bw,5,"Good food, good portion. Chicharron de pescado estava rico."
ChIJnxQvjPgoQg0RFLqwj1wR3bw,5,Food is delicious and the service is perfect
ChIJnxQvjPgoQg0RFLqwj1wR3bw,2,"Bad service attitude, expensive but small amount.."
ChIJDc7X9_soQg0RxhZ0-Th60pY,5,"Completely blown away by the standards of this restaurant. I had already discovered the peruvian cuisine was something fantastic but this place puts the cherry on top.

The food exceeded all my expectations, the service was great, all dishes were explained with a smile and the restaurant was well kept and properly decorated.

The only bad thing is that I couldnt eat more! Thank you for this amazing experience."
ChIJDc7X9_soQg0RxhZ0-Th60pY,5,"One the best restaurants I've visited and one of the better lunch experiences I've had
The dishes were excellent, the staff was genuinely the kindest and most patient, taking the time to explain everything to us. They were  super accommodating as well.
We ordered an extra portion of the cheese entree, a classic ceviche and the beef main dish in the ""recommended"" section of the menu - everything was very tasty and super well seasoned. The portions are super decent.
10/10 would recommend and would definitely visit again."
ChIJDc7X9_soQg0RxhZ0-Th60pY,5,"My first time trying Peruvian cousine and I'm glad I've picked this place! Everything was delicious. They don't speak English, so I used google translate and then googled stuff, settled for scallops (marinated one was especially good) and chicken curry Aji de Galina. Staff was friendly and smily and it was a good experiwnce despite no common language:)"
ChIJDc7X9_soQg0RxhZ0-Th60pY,3,Okay peruvian food. The tres leches cake was very dry.
ChIJDc7X9_soQg0RxhZ0-Th60pY,5,"Amazing and genuine Peruvian food, with a modern twist in some dishes. We had a lovely degustation dinner with 4 courses. The waitresses were engaged and involved, willing to explain about the dishes and teach us about the Peruvian culture. It was a great experience and very affordable."
ChIJlxmkgfwoQg0RI2JxKJgRyt4,4,Clever mix of traditional food and modern design.
ChIJlxmkgfwoQg0RI2JxKJgRyt4,3,"The ham sandwiches are incredible but I have to give it 3 stars because I have been several times and the employees, although they wear gloves to touch the food, do not take them off to collect and they touch the money with the gloves and then serve the next customer without changing them. That doesn't seem right to me."
ChIJlxmkgfwoQg0RI2JxKJgRyt4,5,"The ham sandwiches are great, every time I pass by I buy one. Very nice employees."
ChIJlxmkgfwoQg0RI2JxKJgRyt4,1,Yesterday before the Madrid Barcelona game he caught me passing by to grab a sandwich. At first they tell me that there is only Bellota ham. What is my surprise when I eat the sandwich that doesn't have any Bellota ham at all. Traditional Serrano ham. Luckily I couldn't come back so someone could explain to me where the Bellota ham was. Please don't scam people
ChIJlxmkgfwoQg0RI2JxKJgRyt4,5,"Top-notch sausages, the girls who served me were very nice and helped me choose the best ham for a special occasion.
There is also a lot of variety and the service is first class."
ChIJn9MFN-IoQg0R2cK2wvRxbrs,5,"Very good food and the service impeccable. Good view at the stadium pitch, nice atmosphere, good prices, friendly staff
Recommend"
ChIJn9MFN-IoQg0R2cK2wvRxbrs,5,A nice place with a view to one of the most famous football stadiums in the world. There is a small entrance fee but it includes a drink and is thus totally worth paying.
ChIJn9MFN-IoQg0R2cK2wvRxbrs,5,"This place has good food, cool view of inside the stadium, and very friendly staff.  I recommend it!"
ChIJn9MFN-IoQg0R2cK2wvRxbrs,5,"Maravilloso, Top Notch experience for any Real Madrid Fan, to be able to access the VIP lounge is great."
ChIJn9MFN-IoQg0R2cK2wvRxbrs,5,"Nice quality food. Fantastic view of the stadium from inside restaurant. After tour bernabeu in such a cold weather, you really need a place like this. Fish @‚Ç¨21."
ChIJ47kg-x8pQg0RyVol01iRdOU,5,"Food is good, they have menu in English with picture so its easy to order. Nice decoration."
ChIJ47kg-x8pQg0RyVol01iRdOU,5,Not cheap but very delicious food and friendly service! It's also a quiet and pretty outdoor setting ‚ò∫Ô∏è
ChIJ47kg-x8pQg0RyVol01iRdOU,5,"My family and I celebrated my graduation dinner at Al Paseo and had an absolutely lovely evening. The service, food and outdoor seating were perfect. The tables are big and well spaced out , the restaurant was calm and peaceful and the atmosphere was very enjoyable. All the servers paid a lot of attention to detail and were very helpful. The food was absolutely delicious, I can highly recommend the fish and rice dish for two people. Desserts were also very tasty they even organised a special surprise dessert to celebrate my graduation. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special celebratory meal or a nice family meal. I will surely be returning when I am back in Madrid. Thank you again!"
ChIJ47kg-x8pQg0RyVol01iRdOU,5,Wonderful place to go and have lunch. The food is amazing. I recommend it.
ChIJ47kg-x8pQg0RyVol01iRdOU,3,"Solid food, but for fairly high prices (paid ‚Ç¨50 por half bottle of wine, and 3 small plates, no main). Not very creative, however. And atmosphere feels somewhat off. Night I was there they had awful EDM radio as ambiance music. For that price those kinds of details should be taken care of"
ChIJycrT-x0pQg0RyfnCKIiEv6k,5,"I loved the octopus,  it was very soft and fresh.
As for the rest, it is not ver vegetarian/halal friendly"
ChIJycrT-x0pQg0RyfnCKIiEv6k,4,Good tapas selection. Some unusual variations which were very good. A bit too crowded for my liking and the service slow. Possibly need to better plan. Will definitely visit again!
ChIJycrT-x0pQg0RyfnCKIiEv6k,4,Nice place to have a drink before match
ChIJycrT-x0pQg0RyfnCKIiEv6k,5,Excellent service and delicious food!
ChIJycrT-x0pQg0RyfnCKIiEv6k,5,Good food & Great service.
ChIJw1rj3N4oQg0Ri1xzRYp9iHo,3,Foods a bit pricy but tasty. I recommend the BRATZEL. service is a bit slow. Plus you can't make a reservation to eat out (terrace).
ChIJw1rj3N4oQg0Ri1xzRYp9iHo,5,"Usually they serve German food.  You have good ambience here. Those who like German food,  it's the best place to go. So tasty  food. Better to reserve earlier. There are lots of people."
ChIJw1rj3N4oQg0Ri1xzRYp9iHo,5,"Very rich, flavorful (!) yet authenic German food! Quiet atmosphere with a lovely assortment of German beers on tap. If you‚Äôve had your fill of patatas bravas and chips, have a go at the R√∂sti. It won‚Äôt disappoint!"
ChIJw1rj3N4oQg0Ri1xzRYp9iHo,5,"Great food, absolutely delicious. Great portion sizes."
ChIJw1rj3N4oQg0Ri1xzRYp9iHo,4,Always a great classic german restaurant great beer selection awesome camembert cheese sausage and deserts. Its a big place and of course they take reservations and all credits cards
ChIJxf51KwMpQg0R6MY2vLMgZQE,1,Absolutely disgusting food - worst meal I was served in a long time. Couldn't eat it. I eat better food when I fly on Ryanair.
ChIJxf51KwMpQg0R6MY2vLMgZQE,5,"Fast served, good food ,and not too expensive for the neighborhood"
ChIJxf51KwMpQg0R6MY2vLMgZQE,5,"Very tasty, very good service, very fast serving"
ChIJxf51KwMpQg0R6MY2vLMgZQE,5,"Good service, excellent food"
ChIJxf51KwMpQg0R6MY2vLMgZQE,3,It's okay.
ChIJn9MFN-IoQg0RS5y3zGjc7K0,5,David was exceptionally great in ensuring we had a pleasant lunch. His customer service skills are very professional . Food tasted good as they assured. We had a wonderful time here. One of the best meal we had during our stay in Madrid. Will be back for sure.
ChIJn9MFN-IoQg0RS5y3zGjc7K0,5,"Nice, but a bit too loud and chaotic restaurant next to the Bernabeu Stadium, big variety of food and drinks, with big portions. Our waitress Laura was very polite and kind with us, we had lunch and beers twice during our holiday in Madrid. Gracias! ü´∂üèª"
ChIJn9MFN-IoQg0RS5y3zGjc7K0,1,"We ordered the combo for 2. Drinks arrived after 20 minutes of waiting, there were a maximum of 5 tables occupied. Food arrived after 50 minutes, fries were cold, onion was cold, meat was not so well cooked. Don‚Äôt come here."
ChIJn9MFN-IoQg0RS5y3zGjc7K0,3,Friendly staff and nice place. But portions are small and the fries tasted like they were a day old.
ChIJn9MFN-IoQg0RS5y3zGjc7K0,4,"I ordered here for the first time and tried one of their Smokey Cheese Angus Burger and I loved it, they cooked the meat as I preferred and it came with fries! I wish there was the option to remove ingredients while ordering though, I didn‚Äôt want the onions and I couldn‚Äôt manage to get in contact w the restaurant to say so. In any case overall recommended, will be back"
ChIJleb3LuIoQg0R_crGUzvKaW8,5,We had a quick lunch after the Bernabeu tour. The food is so tasty. Highly recommended
ChIJleb3LuIoQg0R_crGUzvKaW8,3,"My recent dining experience here was deeply disappointing. Despite arriving early, the staff appeared unwelcoming toward Asian customers, prioritizing seating for non-Asian patrons behind us in line. After a prolonged wait, we were assigned a table directly by the entrance with a constant draft‚Äîeven though other vacant seats were available. When requesting to move, the staff initially refused and only reluctantly agreed after sensing our frustration.

Service remained subpar throughout the meal: orders were taken with indifference, dishes arrived at an unreasonably slow pace, and requests for assistance were met with minimal effort. The lack of professionalism and apparent bias in treatment left a sour impression. I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking respectful service or a comfortable dining environment."
ChIJleb3LuIoQg0R_crGUzvKaW8,5,Best pasta in Madrid. Thank you:)
ChIJleb3LuIoQg0R_crGUzvKaW8,5,"The food was absolutely incredible, and the atmosphere added so much to the overall experience. Every dish we ordered‚Äîstarter, pizza, and pasta‚Äîwas outstanding, making it nearly impossible to choose a favorite. Everything was just exceptional. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone, as it‚Äôs hands down the best Italian food I‚Äôve had in Madrid."
ChIJleb3LuIoQg0R_crGUzvKaW8,3,"Espaguetis vongole y Fettucine were just ok, and Un acceptable a dish of boletus a la plancha (extreamly not reccomend). The prices are high compare with the qualily. Only 1 things good here was a service."
ChIJK808xh0pQg0RM33uldWWDhk,5,"This is a must visit. This is my second time here with a years break in between. I‚Äôm not lying when I say I would come to Madrid just to have their fresh home made pasta puttanesca and their home made tiramisu

Hands down my all time favorite here!"
ChIJK808xh0pQg0RM33uldWWDhk,5,"Incredible Italian dishes, especially the macarrones al horno. We didn‚Äôt order the pizza but they looked and smelled delicious. Next time we will try them!"
ChIJK808xh0pQg0RM33uldWWDhk,4,We had spaghetti Arrabiata and vegetable pizza. Both were amazing.
ChIJK808xh0pQg0RM33uldWWDhk,5,"Have been to this place many times. An authentic family restaurant run by real Italians. Many delicious pizza and pasta options, and amazing tiramis√∫. Staff are friendly and attentive. Especially when the terrace is open, a great place to spend an evening."
ChIJK808xh0pQg0RM33uldWWDhk,5,"Called late without a reservation. They were busy.  Incredibly friendly engaging staff.
The food was great, Several vegetarian options available. Definitely recommend, best food we had in Madrid."
ChIJGbDD2hwpQg0RjT5vRhBjH0s,5,"Everything was excellent, from the service and staff to the timing of the courses, including the starter, main dish, and dessert.
Trying the cachopo here is an absolute must! it was incredibly delicious and full of flavor.
I‚Äôd definitely love to come back and try more dishes from their menu."
ChIJGbDD2hwpQg0RjT5vRhBjH0s,5,"What a wonderful experience for our 1st meal in Madrid.  The food selection filled everyone expecting, and the service was over the top.  The vibrant inside dining was beyond expectations.

Then the food , wow the food, ordered mussels,  prepared 2 ways, superp, my wife the vegetarian was pleased, the food allergies handled and the desserts, wow.

I thought the price for a full meal for all was extremely reasonable...

Knowing we were Americans, I was reminded the tip was not included. They were super happy with a 10% gratuity.

I slipped the expeditor his own tip in cash.  This restaurant was recommended by the hotel H10, and it did not disappoint."
ChIJGbDD2hwpQg0RjT5vRhBjH0s,5,"Great service and allowed us to bring a cake to celebrate our friends birthday. The tomahawk steak was pure perfection. We did the bacalao balls, cachopo and a salad. Was so delicious ü§§"
ChIJGbDD2hwpQg0RjT5vRhBjH0s,5,Amazing in every sense! Traditional Asturian restaurant with outstanding quality food (steaks are speechless and also unexpectedly the cheesecake). Prices are reasonable for the experience (around 60‚Ç¨ each) and the staff is very efficient and friendly. Will come back again for sure!
ChIJGbDD2hwpQg0RjT5vRhBjH0s,1,"Not worth the price, rise way too salty, we could not eat it and they made us pay it anyways. The waitress throwing things at the table. More than 100‚Ç¨ for 2 adults and 1 kid, taking only tortilla, tomato, ensalada rusa and the rise. Not recommended."
ChIJEVBxyBwpQg0RO_KGeiBun4A,5,‚ÄûExcellent‚Äú or ‚ÄûGreat‚Äú would not do this place justice. This is culinary perfection - and a sensational ambience.
ChIJEVBxyBwpQg0RO_KGeiBun4A,5,"Everyone should have a waiter like Carlos!
As I only had a a few hours in Madrid I wanted to have a quick but cozy dinner somewhere in the area near my hotel. When I stepped inside, the waiter welcomed me so pleasantly that I immediately felt comfortable by myself. He happily showed me a few tables where I got to choose where I wanted to sit down. The smile and excitement of the waiter named Carlos was such a delight and he asked me how hungry I was from 1-10. I told him that I was on a 7,8 scale.. We laughed and he suggested to take care of it, asking about my preferences (meat, fish, vegetables) and came back with a nice glass of cava.
The first round he brought me 3 dishes, which I absolutely adored! The classic croquetas, one sardine, and another fish dish. Carlos checked in on me several times to make sure I was alright. As well as the other waiters/waitresses, they were all so friendly! After the first round, I got the last two dishes, which were fried bacalao and meat on a skewer. Fantastic! At this point I was almost saturated with all the delicious food, however a small portion of some manchego always seals the deal thanks to a colleague of Carlos. A recommendation from Carlos for a glass of delicious Rioja and a small chupito to finish off.

Overall, great atmosphere, friendly people, and a dinner measured to preference! Thank you Carlos and the rest of the team for making my first, and probably not the last experience in Madrid already a good one."
ChIJEVBxyBwpQg0RO_KGeiBun4A,5,"Great neighborhood restaurant with a charming theme. Been coming here for years. Finally posting a review. Good food, friendly staff, and great ambience!"
ChIJEVBxyBwpQg0RO_KGeiBun4A,4,"Built into an old pharmacy, the original decor with lots of vials and bottles, beautiful blue tiling, and old dark wood makes for a great space to enjoy drinks and classic Spanish tapas. We had prompt service and very tasty torreznos."
ChIJEVBxyBwpQg0RO_KGeiBun4A,5,"Fantastic location and food!
Price also ok.
Super recommended"
ChIJMywGyhwpQg0RWHUm5XlT5aw,5,"Exceptional!
Outstanding food, extraordinary service, and great atmosphere.
Anything on the men√∫ you would love it!
We got a set menu with appetizers, salad, veal, dessert, and even a digestive drink .
Please don't forget the wine!
GOOOOOIüíØ"
ChIJMywGyhwpQg0RWHUm5XlT5aw,5,"The service was great and waiters were very friendly. The artichoke as a starter with a separate plate of  chorizo was great. I wish we had ordered the morcilla pudding though!

The leg of lamb and the cochinillo were top notch as well. The lamb chops were a little small but still very enjoyable üëçüèº (if you want to have it with white rice try asking the staff if it‚Äôs possible üòú)"
ChIJMywGyhwpQg0RWHUm5XlT5aw,5,"Very nice restaurant serving oven-roasted lamb.. ‚Äã
‚ÄãOne of the best restaurants in Madrid..
Thanks to the restaurant staff.."
ChIJMywGyhwpQg0RWHUm5XlT5aw,5,A beautiful setting to eat in. The oven-cooked lamb was fantastic and melted off the bone.
ChIJMywGyhwpQg0RWHUm5XlT5aw,5,"So beautiful experience. Fantastico food, perfect service, good wine, and a great place to stay. Lovely dinner, lovely evening and lovely experience. I will come back when in Madrid"
ChIJR4nY3-MoQg0R1pY1lFf7F34,1,"We‚Äôve visited other VIPS branches and they‚Äôve become our favorite places in Madrid. However, our experience at this particular location was terrible. We ordered a VIPS Club Smash and a Rainbow Poke Bowl, both of which we had enjoyed at other branches. Unfortunately, the burger and fries were not fresh at all, and the rice and salmon in the poke bowl were also stale. We do not recommend this place!"
ChIJR4nY3-MoQg0R1pY1lFf7F34,5,We liked the food here so much that we visited here again for our breakfast. We just love the pancakes they serve specifically with chicken and ham. The yogurt bowl is must try too.
ChIJR4nY3-MoQg0R1pY1lFf7F34,5,Food was delicious.Robertina was very amazing she went extra mile to help us even though we couldn‚Äôt understand Spanish. We would be back soon. She listened attentively to my son .Thank you Robertina!!
ChIJR4nY3-MoQg0R1pY1lFf7F34,4,"I had no issue at all. Waiter was kind, food was delivered promptly and prices were reasonable"
ChIJR4nY3-MoQg0R1pY1lFf7F34,5,"Dayanara was great, quick to help me out with my choices of food, and was warm to welcome"
ChIJFXUWj-MoQg0RA7dy3vE848w,4,"Friendly place, great staff and service, and good comfortable food and refreshments!"
ChIJFXUWj-MoQg0RA7dy3vE848w,5,"This is a great place, I 100% recommend coming with friends and having a nice time, I always go because the service is very good and the food is excellent. It is well located and the place is too nice!"
ChIJFXUWj-MoQg0RA7dy3vE848w,5,"The dinner is very good, the teque√±os, the meatballs or the sandwiches are incredible. The prices are great, but without a doubt the best thing is the attention of the waiters. We have been coming for many years and they have always been super attentive and affectionate."
ChIJFXUWj-MoQg0RA7dy3vE848w,1,"Regrettable, lousy.
The worst burger I've had in years. The photo speaks for itself...no accompaniment, the frozen fried legs, the frozen and flavorless bread, and the rather mediocre burger. Expensive and bad, don't consider coming here. An aquarius and a sparkling water almost ‚Ç¨8 in total! Scandinavian prices and horrible quality.

Edit: I tried to contact them several times, by email, fb mssn... and nothing. The answer they wrote was of no use, but I'm not surprised..."
ChIJFXUWj-MoQg0RA7dy3vE848w,5,"One of the best quality/price restaurants, the teque√±os and the croquettes are the best of all. In addition, Gabriela attended us, she is charming and was very attentive at all times."
ChIJtdk9eOMoQg0RTO_VGRqrZjY,4,"Nice place to stop and have a drink or two, prices are reasonable just one thing we didn‚Äôt notice that if you sit in outside terrace you need to pay extra 10% for everything. Were almoust full house and for outside terrace were only one waiter so she did very well and was moving fast. Inside lamps made of old green wine bottles look amazing and blends in all design very nice. Free chips is always nice, but the burger i ordered with oxtail meat was all cold, so whole experience could be better."
ChIJtdk9eOMoQg0RTO_VGRqrZjY,3,"We enjoyed some daily specials and specially the basket of fruit if the see.
Today around 3:20 we went there for lunch and was faced with a young girl who did not have ant sense of hospitality. We ordered social of the day salad & chicken w/ potato.
The chicken was precooked and baseless, potatoes lukewarm , the bread were so old that could have been used as a tennis ball.
We asked the girl to bring us dome fresher bread, she replied this see fresh from today which was a lie.. very disappointed."
ChIJtdk9eOMoQg0RTO_VGRqrZjY,5,"I couldn‚Äôt give this place 5 stars fast enough. Clean, cold beer, and reasonably priced for the area. I stopped here to kill some time before a Real Madrid game and was pleasantly surprised. I watched a waiter thoroughly sanitize every menu (even despite Covid this is rare) which was comforting. The beer was also extremely cold which is more rare. Despite its proximity to the stadium the prices are also quite good too. I had 2 tapas, 3 beers and a coffee for 14 euros. As things got more and more busy as game time got closer the waitstaff continued to provide exceptional service even to guests outside. Cannot recommend this place enough!"
ChIJtdk9eOMoQg0RTO_VGRqrZjY,5,"If you‚Äôre looking for a real party with Latin vibes you should definitely come here, such a great atmosphere, nice drinks and good music!"
ChIJtdk9eOMoQg0RTO_VGRqrZjY,5,"Stopped by here to have some food,drinks and to watch a football game. Had an amazing night here as the food was magnificent! And staff was great as well, really friendly and acted super fast when placing orders. Highly recomended!"
ChIJs1txk-MoQg0RBBREg88xSLg,5,"Delicious meal from this restaurant, I personally love the Iberico ham with artichoke is a nice match."
ChIJs1txk-MoQg0RBBREg88xSLg,5,"Grilleg veg with red pesto very delicious. Paired with burrata and some fries (home made).
Service was perfect and attentive. When visiting the Real Madrid stadium make a detour and eat here, it is worth it."
ChIJs1txk-MoQg0RBBREg88xSLg,5,"Incredible place to spend with the family, the attention of the staff is unbeatable and close. They have an excellent culinary variety.
Totally recommendable."
ChIJs1txk-MoQg0RBBREg88xSLg,5,Very nice terrace to have a few bevvies and enjoy a good meal all day long. Favorite place around.
ChIJs1txk-MoQg0RBBREg88xSLg,5,Perfect place for lunch
ChIJEUtB5uMoQg0RYHl447-x7b0,5,"Did not get to eat much there, but it was nice. The place is beautiful, and the library  deco is amazing for book lovers.  Cocktails are nice, and the service is very kind.
Will come back to eat."
ChIJEUtB5uMoQg0RYHl447-x7b0,4,Tasty food. The Arroz con Cangrejo Real y Vieras is a must try. The Carrot Cake was also nice. The decor is really well put together. Specially now with the Christmas vibes.
ChIJEUtB5uMoQg0RYHl447-x7b0,5,"The food was absolutely lovely. Service could be improved and staff could be kinder, makes a difference! Tuna croquettes, prawn tempura, duck rice dish are thoroughly recommended."
ChIJEUtB5uMoQg0RYHl447-x7b0,5,The poke bowl never fails with the taste and portion size. The prawn tower is also always a fave and the salmon pizza was surprisingly good too!
ChIJEUtB5uMoQg0RYHl447-x7b0,2,"I visited this restaurant with my friend to celebrate her birthday. We arrived at 8:20 PM, and at 9:30 PM, when we asked for more water, the waitress‚Äîwho lacked basic customer service skills‚Äîtook five minutes to approach us, only to inform us that they could no longer serve us anything. She claimed that our reservation was for 8:00 PM and that we had to leave by 9:30 PM. This was shocking, as I have never been treated this way in any restaurant before.

As a result, we were forced to leave without even having our dessert, which was part of the d√©gustation menu. They offered to pack it for takeaway, but serving ice cream to-go? No, thank you.

The food itself was average at best‚Äînothing impressive. One of the dishes we ordered, the Red Prawn Tempura with Sweet Chili, was particularly disappointing. The only thing I could taste was vinegar in the sauce, completely overpowering everything else.
Overall, a very underwhelming experience, both in terms of service and food."
ChIJw8dSQOMoQg0Rkr89y-WiiOE,5,"After having a burger in NY a couple weeks ago, I wasn‚Äôt sure about trying this place üòÇ Thank goodness it‚Äôs soo much better!! Husband had a plain cheeseburger and I had a chicken sandwich. The chicken was AMAZING!! One of the best chicken sandwiches I‚Äôve ever had! The hint of charcoal grilling was in the taste and wow! And big water glasses!!! We never had to ask for a refill and that was awesome! The fries were good too. The restaurant was clean and the service was good. Lady took great care of us! And the music was bomb too!"
ChIJw8dSQOMoQg0Rkr89y-WiiOE,5,Daniel our server was professional. He was efficient and accommodating. The burgers were great and so was the service. We tried the new ribs burger and the empire burger. They were delicious. We also ordered the Oreo chocolate cal which came with ice cream. Definitely going back to try the rest of the menu.
ChIJw8dSQOMoQg0Rkr89y-WiiOE,5,As always a good experience specially with Diego ‚ù§Ô∏è service was fast and the new ambiance made it even better. Taste is well on point and was very generous with the ingredients.
ChIJw8dSQOMoQg0Rkr89y-WiiOE,5,"Great find in the middle of Madrid. Took a chance and ordered brisket tacos as an appetizer. The brisket was tender and well seasoned. The burger had a nice smokey flavor. Our server, Diego, was attentive. Great overall experience."
ChIJw8dSQOMoQg0Rkr89y-WiiOE,5,"I recently visited New York Burger in Madrid and was thoroughly impressed. I ordered the Queens Burger, which was delicious‚Äîjuicy, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfection. The mozzarella sticks were also a highlight, crispy on the outside with perfectly melted cheese inside. For my drink, I chose the Summer Wine, and it was the perfect refreshing complement to my meal. Overall, a fantastic dining experience, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone craving a great burger!"
ChIJA8hSQOMoQg0ReZrkFyABxTg,5,Best falafel I have had in a long time. Service was weird. The waiter saw us waiting to be seated and just ignored us. Didn‚Äôt explain to us we could just sit whenever or how the ordering worked. Food though made up for it!
ChIJA8hSQOMoQg0ReZrkFyABxTg,5,"I recently visited Honest Greens in Castellana, Madrid. The restaurant has a modern, welcoming atmosphere with plenty of natural light and stylish decor, making it a great spot for a relaxing meal. The menu is diverse, offering fresh, high-quality ingredients with plenty of healthy, plant-based, and gluten-free options.

I tried their garden bowls  and a refreshing cold-pressed juice, both of which were flavorful and satisfying. The staff was friendly and attentive. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for wholesome, delicious food in Madrid!"
ChIJA8hSQOMoQg0ReZrkFyABxTg,5,"Food is very nice and fresh. There is an open kitchen so you see how it is made, very nice. The restaurant works like this: you order first at the counter and pay. Then they give you a device that vib rates when your order is ready. You can't reserve a table though, so queue might be there! But we went there for breakfast on a Monday morning and there was no one.
We ordered an avocado toast and an XL yogurt (I ordered the vegan version with coconut yogurt) and they were both super tasty (although I suggest the yogurt for sharing as it was super big and I couldn't finish it alone - size comparison with my hand in the photo!). There are many vegetarian/vegan options all over the menu! Highly recommended :)"
ChIJA8hSQOMoQg0ReZrkFyABxTg,5,"I would eat at Honest Greens for every meal if I could. The food has so much flavor, it‚Äôs made fresh to order right in front of you, and the atmosphere is a cool cafe vibe. Isabel and Alvaro took care of me and my very large group‚Äôs order. They saved the day! I can‚Äôt thank them or this location enough for our amazing lunch. My colleague eat here 4 times during our week trip. I will miss Honest Greens when I return to the US!"
ChIJA8hSQOMoQg0ReZrkFyABxTg,4,"It's a classic to have for lunch during the weekdays for all the people working in the towers and companies around.
It's a tasty and cheap option if you want to eat healthy.
The pick up spot so you do not wait in queue works really good! Overall advisable!
(Delicious betroot ketchup with the sweet potatoes)"
ChIJA8hSQOMoQg0RmI8GhPr7gVI,3,"Not upfront/honest with business practices, but great food. We ate a buffet on a weekday night, and realised that the restaurant charges extra for more than one serve of sashimi salmon, tuna, scallops, and compels each person to purchase one drink. This in itself is not bad, but the fact that it was totally not disclosed until after we began ordering is not particularly good. The sushi is very high quality, authentic and fresh aside from the miso soup which was very very salty and undrinkable."
ChIJA8hSQOMoQg0RmI8GhPr7gVI,4,The menu of the day is one of the best in terms of value for money. The food comes out quickly and the place is nice. The food is good. The service is okay. One server wasn‚Äôt very helpful but the rest were super attentive.
ChIJA8hSQOMoQg0RmI8GhPr7gVI,5,"Very nice experience, service was correct and the dishes were really good prepared. I would love to go back again !"
ChIJA8hSQOMoQg0RmI8GhPr7gVI,5,"Really loved the place!! Great ambiance to have a nice meal. We ordered the buffet menu and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, although there is a catch, you have to eat everything you order and if you don‚Äôt they charge you an extra. You get to order 3 times up to 5 plates per person per order out of the 71 plates they have on the menu. This is not the only option, you can also order out of the non buffet menu that has other options even premium ones.
The food was delicious, we had sushi rolls, noddles and even ordered a ‚Äúsolomillo‚Äù plate that would totally recommend if you‚Äôre meat lover."
ChIJA8hSQOMoQg0RmI8GhPr7gVI,4,"I am really surprised with the service; it is fast and clean. They use a tablet where you can see all the offers of the menu. Also, they have a Buffet (the price is around 15/17 euros/ not included drinks), where you could choose different sushi, or dishes, and order a new one until you can not eat a single piece more (ALWAYS IF YOU COULD EAT ALL THE PIECES OF SUSHI THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ORDERED BEFORE). Good taste (not the best I have ever tried), good price. We will coming back for sure."
ChIJIYDpY-EoQg0RdnRVC3sFNdk,5,Everything was delicious! Thank you!
ChIJIYDpY-EoQg0RdnRVC3sFNdk,5,One of my favourites. loads of types of Jamon and other spanish coldcuts as well as a good selection of local cheeses. Of course also a great wine selection. But you can also grab a coffee in the morning
ChIJIYDpY-EoQg0RdnRVC3sFNdk,3,"In my opinion, it is way overpriced for what's around.

I ordered a glass of wine, small water (3.9 euros), half a portion of jamon and I paid 27.3 euros.
The waiter asked me if I wanted the plain bread or the one with tomate, when I ordered, making it sound like it was part of my jam√≥n order. It was actually another 4.50 euros.

I don't recommend it and won't be back."
ChIJIYDpY-EoQg0RdnRVC3sFNdk,5,"Excellent selection of ham, chorizo and other charcuterie from the Extremadura region. They also have a good range of cheese and of course wine to wash it all down. It‚Äôs casual but the food is great."
ChIJIYDpY-EoQg0RdnRVC3sFNdk,5,"Great food and coffee, delicious ham and cheeses. Our waiter Javier was superb, very friendly and diligent. Definitely a place to come back next time we visit Madrid."
ChIJT3ZE0-IoQg0R5E-PyDWJ8Fc,3,"I have taken takeout from this place a few times. Every time I am surprised again by the size of the portions, but at least it is healthy food and it is delicious. They accept checks/restaurant cards.
You can eat there although there are 3 or 4 small tables, it is mostly for take away.

Advantages:
- Delicious and healthy food: they have grilled chicken, quinoa with vegetables, creams, etc.
- If you eat little, you can eat for less money than with a daily menu
- Ready to go and usually little queue if you have little time to eat

Disadvantages:
- The portion size is very small, you need to get a first and second and you can still be hungry
- Expensive for what you end up consuming
- The food takes time to prepare and you heat it yourself in small microwaves that are in a column"
ChIJT3ZE0-IoQg0R5E-PyDWJ8Fc,2,"The food is very delicious, but the portions are a real scam. 6 euros for a small piece of cod and 4 pieces of broccoli"
ChIJT3ZE0-IoQg0R5E-PyDWJ8Fc,5,"Every week I stop by here to buy my container. The food is very good and healthy, even though it was made a few hours ago it remains fresh and juicy. There is enough variety so that you don't get bored, and the girls who serve you are very friendly. Personally, I always go at least one day a week for salmon, delicious! The grilled chicken and turkey are also very good. They also have desserts (yogurt, applesauce, whole wheat cake) and fruit in small glasses. Good price, it's not cheap but it's not expensive either, and the quality is noticeable.

It is true that the portions are not very large, but it also depends on what you order and how you combine it. The chicken and turkey is quite filling, and if you combine it with brown rice you will not leave hungry. If you order a tower of eggplant, mozzarella cheese and tomato, or a salad, you're going to need a second.

Zero complaints."
ChIJT3ZE0-IoQg0R5E-PyDWJ8Fc,1,"We used to go get food until people at the company started getting poisoned. In a period of just one month, seven colleagues have been sick after eating here, in most cases fish. For a couple of weeks, none of us have returned. Frankly, I don't understand how they can neglect their processes so much, being something that directly affects people's health."
ChIJT3ZE0-IoQg0R5E-PyDWJ8Fc,2,"It seems expensive to me for the small amount they put in and on top of that it's takeaway and plastic is generated with the disposable cutlery (thank goodness they did make the food containers made of cardboard) and no one serves you and so on and you have to heat it yourself in the microwave, so I don't understand why it's so expensive. Furthermore, I also don't see it as being especially healthier than other restaurants that don't have the word ""sano"" or ""health"" in their title. I won't repeat it since I was so hungry that I had to go to the Carrefour next door to buy food and feel satisfied."
ChIJM94TceEoQg0R4l6oynsWu6A,5,"Cozy, good place. Good value for price, tasty pastery."
ChIJM94TceEoQg0R4l6oynsWu6A,5,"Came here for lunch after a visit to the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium üèü The range of sandwiches here is amazing, great value for money. Definitely worth a visit if you fancy a little lunch ü•™‚òïü•§"
ChIJM94TceEoQg0R4l6oynsWu6A,5,Good value for money quick pit stop
ChIJM94TceEoQg0R4l6oynsWu6A,5,Great for a lunchtime snack‚Ä¶ lovely sandwich
ChIJM94TceEoQg0R4l6oynsWu6A,5,Very nice place for having snacks .Nice staff and service..Enjoying eating variety of sandwiches...
ChIJNbm9cuEoQg0RFoxkMctjPV0,5,Greate quality of packing box. Of course the sushi is fresh and delicious as well.
ChIJNbm9cuEoQg0RFoxkMctjPV0,5,Great service and good food.
ChIJNbm9cuEoQg0RFoxkMctjPV0,5,Best sushi in Madrid!

ChIJ7z7XLPsoQg0RhRHzWxOYgvs,5,"My to-go quick snack whenever I'm in nuevos, love the food and love the place. It's like it was put there for a very good reason"
ChIJ7z7XLPsoQg0RhRHzWxOYgvs,5,Amazing place! We always came here for Friday lunch before covid and they are still the best. It's cheap and very tasty. I recommend debreziner or chicken burger and of course a mahou ;)
ChIJ7z7XLPsoQg0RhRHzWxOYgvs,5,Awesome food and great service!
ChIJ7z7XLPsoQg0RhRHzWxOYgvs,5,Nice gee
ChIJ7z7XLPsoQg0RhRHzWxOYgvs,3,Just a small kiosk that we stopped for a beer at
ChIJBbaZ0uIoQg0Rrd0sIrUoWE0,3,"There was little help for a lack of Spanish. We didn't understand the woman treating us, she didn't know English and I told her in the morning that I wanted a slice of ""omlette y patatas"" (omelette with potatoes) and she said something I didn't understand, don't think she had the patience to bridge that gap. But with other clients she was super helpful. I have nothing against her, I think she's excellent and servitude is high. But, my experience wanting something I didn't get was disappointing. Everything else was alright. I think it's a good place overall, better if you know Spanish.
I still got my naranjas (orange juice), cafe con leche (coffee with milk) and sandwich (pointed at what I wanted)."
ChIJBbaZ0uIoQg0Rrd0sIrUoWE0,5,This quite nice Bar üçª with good food and small yet nice ambience
ChIJBbaZ0uIoQg0Rrd0sIrUoWE0,3,Too expensive for a quick drink but next to santiago bernabeu
ChIJBbaZ0uIoQg0Rrd0sIrUoWE0,5,So friendly and a good CUP of Tea.
ChIJBbaZ0uIoQg0Rrd0sIrUoWE0,2,Ok
ChIJX6-fLMslQg0R6XXvKJQRA7k,5,"We looked up for a random restaurant on google maps and we took a chance on this restaurant. ALL dishes we ordered are AWESOME!!!, they are very tasty and got beautifully plated...

Calamari is the best and it surprised us as it doesn‚Äôt look like what we normally expected when ordering this menu. This flavorful dish is a  ‚Äúmust try‚Äù!!!

Servers and Chef are also nice and friendly. This restaurant is highly recommended! You won‚Äôt regret ;)"
ChIJX6-fLMslQg0R6XXvKJQRA7k,5,"We had such a great time dining here. We were lucky to have found a table since it‚Äôs packed. For starters we were given a pincho de tortilla (on the house). For our primer plato, we ordered setas de primavera (highly recommended) and then their arroz de la le√±a for our main dish. And I must say that arroz dish was an explosion of flavor. For dessert we shared a serving of panacotta.

The service was excellent, our meals were served promptly.

Dine here if you have the chance.

Price ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨"
ChIJX6-fLMslQg0R6XXvKJQRA7k,4,"Fantastic food (*very* impressive tomates & croquetas, excellent hummus, rather good arroz de gamba roja) in a small (maybe too small) but nicely decorated place. Very attentive service. Prices not excessive (given the area)"
ChIJX6-fLMslQg0R6XXvKJQRA7k,5,Chanced upon this amazing restaurant..we had roast beef & grilled cod fish.. just superb! Lovely plating...Great food & service!!!
ChIJX6-fLMslQg0R6XXvKJQRA7k,4,Madrid has great choices for culinary experiences. I would try others. This is not a place I would return. I don't think it was bad. It is just that I couldn't find a reason to come back.
ChIJt56L4OAoQg0R5Am-hUfH7w8,5,"Nice experience, local cuisine was very good, staff was great helping us with menu and our limited Spanish."
ChIJt56L4OAoQg0R5Am-hUfH7w8,5,"First time in Spain. not sure about their lunchtime hours, Boss was kind enough to let us have it earlier around 12pm (normally, lunch is 2pm there). we really wanna try some authentic local foods we were really appreciate the kind gesture for us. Staff was kind and gave some good recommendations. The food was fresh and delicious. Nice rustic ambiance  but with limted sitting, walking distance from Santiago Bernabeu stadium.  ."
ChIJt56L4OAoQg0R5Am-hUfH7w8,5,"The daily menu of this palace should be the standard of the hosteler√≠a industry. Good choices between vegetables and meat and even fish plates. Decorations of classical bodega and good service, friendly staffs. Its homemade style is just fabulous. It's a place where you can go everyday without feeling tiered."
ChIJt56L4OAoQg0R5Am-hUfH7w8,4,"Great food. We had a menu that cost 20‚Ç¨ for appetizers, main meal and desert + drink. The food was great. Be careful that the staff nearly can't speak English and the menu is not in English."
ChIJt56L4OAoQg0R5Am-hUfH7w8,5,Food is quite salty for me but it was good overal
ChIJza9OAeEoQg0Rux56nRJhtd0,5,"Exquisite treatment, any of the people you talk to there perfectly represent the smile of the Thai people, honestly when I have to go for a task I feel that more than working I am visiting great friends. Patri, Cris, they are huge!!"
ChIJza9OAeEoQg0Rux56nRJhtd0,5,They resolved my doubts in a couple of minutes.

ü§µüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èService: 4/5
ü™ëAmbiance: 4/5 (Don‚Äôt sit next to the terrace door)

üìùNotes: Overall I was satisfied with the food and service for a restaurant in a mall. There was only one waiter who spoke English. I liked the food, maybe not amazing but it was decent. I would just suggest fixing the tables near the door in the terrace because every time someone walked past me. It felt like an earthquake üí• Maybe its the flooring and not the table. But anyways just keep that in mind for next time ü§ôüèº"
ChIJR92QJvsoQg0RDZL8YfulBPQ,5,"Noeme is a fantastic waitress - so professional, charming and polite.

The restaurant is a ‚Äúmust visit‚Äù venue for traditional Spanish  food - lots of wonderful fish/shellfish in a ‚Äúold school‚Äù fashion but with a very modern twist -  something for everyone."
ChIJR92QJvsoQg0RDZL8YfulBPQ,5,"I love this place!!!! The food is super tasty, fresh, and just the right sizes. My absolute favorites are ‚ÄúCoquinas, Chipirones and Pan con Tomate.
I ALWAYS  come for a meal every time when I visit Madrid, for the food and the atmosphere.
Miguel looked after us, and he was great!
Super recommended!!!!"
ChIJR92QJvsoQg0RDZL8YfulBPQ,5,"We love eating grabbing a fast bite here at the bar.
The solomillo al ajillo, croquetas and ensaladilla have no match.
Lester‚Äôs service is always top notch"
ChIJ84y_gfwoQg0R6mc7qaKXuwI,5,"Very good restaurant , next to hostal siesta , really tasty tortilla de huevos con jamon y queso , fantastic coffee and atmosphere top. Really recemend this place if you want to experience traditional atmosphere when a lot of people come here to have breakfast. Love it!!!"
ChIJ84y_gfwoQg0R6mc7qaKXuwI,4,"Very good food and service
It needs to review the decoration as it's simple"
ChIJ84y_gfwoQg0R6mc7qaKXuwI,4,Good food..and fast service.
ChIJ84y_gfwoQg0R6mc7qaKXuwI,2,"Poor quality food...

Site without being anything out of this world. Staff that is pleasant and strives to ensure that the customer is satisfied.

Low price for the area. I ordered a Galician lacon toast on recommendation and it didn't go down well. Heavy and takes time to digest.

I don't recommend it..."
ChIJ84y_gfwoQg0R6mc7qaKXuwI,4,Affordable Menu of the Day. The Arroz de la Casa with mushrooms and chicken is a must try. Correct service.
ChIJxWAk-_woQg0RrG31IBp3d1g,5,"I loved the place.
The decoration, the atmosphere and the food.
Yes, it is true that you have to like this type of restaurant, but its menu is extensive with meats, fish and vegetables that are 100% organic and quality certified."
ChIJG1pt7_woQg0RCn98uV-1i0Y,1,I've got food poisoned; clearly this place has very low hygene standards
ChIJG1pt7_woQg0RCn98uV-1i0Y,5,Great place to have some quick fresh food that is mixed while you are ordering. The venue is simple and big. You have to take your plate and choose the salad or food then take it to the cashier section and there you can select your toppings. The prices are moderate yet it's more than the usual spanish venue so expect to pay little bit more.
ChIJG1pt7_woQg0RCn98uV-1i0Y,1,"We went here because it looks like a nice place. And it is actually a nice place, but: waiters not very welcoming, and useful (wifi was not working, and I am not a spanish speaker and they did zero effort, like if I was a pain). We order coffees and after took food, and after one waiter came to ask us to leave if we do not order more... So I will not give my money to this place anymore"
ChIJG1pt7_woQg0RCn98uV-1i0Y,5,The place is cozy and have a bohemian feel. With little and big tables and sofas! Its the better version of Starbucks but for saladas lol. The salads are fresh! The juice is pre-made but delicious. The service are A+.
ChIJG1pt7_woQg0RCn98uV-1i0Y,5,Many options for making a salad
ChIJcx9WI_soQg0R_GEGA9VYE2I,1,"I Lost my Cellphone while eating at this restaurant.
A woman in her 50s came to our table asking if the table in front of us was empty (we didnt really respond to the woman just make hand sign for about 5 second, because the woman asked in Spanish and we don't speak Spanish) , the woman looked good, wore a shawl, dressed well.  She came to our table twice.  the second time he came to our table again just to take the tissue at the table in front of us.  In less than 5 minutes the cellphone was taken and when we checked on the Apple Watch 5 minutes later Find My iPhone was turned off.  the security guard didn't do anything meaningful, just asking the chronology and asking our data, even though we immediately reported 5 minutes later, the just recommend us to go to police station which is can not be reach by on foot. The incident occurred around 8 p.m, while not really many people there, thats why we are pretty sure that woman is the thief.
TIPS: For foreign tourists, I highly recommend not eating at food court restaurants like Gourmet Experience because it will be easy for anyone ( even not costumers ) to come to your dining table.  BEWARE OF THIEVES HERE"
ChIJcx9WI_soQg0R_GEGA9VYE2I,5,"They carry a great selection of high end wines and cheeses. They also have a nice set up of about a dozen food stands. Juan working at the liquors department is the best and he was incredibly helpful with finding rare Japanese whiskys. They also carry some super high end jamon, at about 200 euros a kilo, but this stuff is righteous, with its beautiful fat marbling and its melty texture and its funky umami explosion."
ChIJcx9WI_soQg0R_GEGA9VYE2I,3,"Loved the food, atmosphere, music. Excellent service.
The only let down was that some dishes, plates and beer glass was chipped. Unacceptable for El Corte Ingl√©s gourmet. The only thing that spoilt it"
ChIJcx9WI_soQg0R_GEGA9VYE2I,5,"Excellent Wine, Fish, Crab, Crawfish, Oyster, Lamb, Aubergines and Flan. Special in the end: Sorbete de limon. All around perfect taste, perfect ambiente, perfect lunch. Thank you!"
ChIJcx9WI_soQg0R_GEGA9VYE2I,4,Seemed to have much fewer items/variety than before. But it is good to get a few rare items not common in normal supermarkets.
ChIJ5dDMCNooQg0RkashKdvMOx4,5,"Great experience, very welcome staff. Also English speaking. Excellent Mexican dishes. All with a twist not the standard regular food. Also great assortment of cocktails with tequila and mezcal."
ChIJ5dDMCNooQg0RkashKdvMOx4,5,"Our first visit to √ìrale un pedacito was fantastic, thanks to Manuel and his team's outstanding service. The tacos Al pastor were the best I've had in Madrid ‚Äîa different approach, very well marinated and full of flavor. The flautas, served with two types of mole, were equally delicious.

The tres leches cake was a moist and creamy, especially when paired with a Mexican Carajillo.

With such exceptional food and service, we'll definitely be back. Highly recommended for anyone craving authentic Mexican cuisine in Madrid!"
ChIJ5dDMCNooQg0RkashKdvMOx4,5,"Good Mexican restaurant. You can eat what you expect to find in a mexican restaurant, the menu is simple but clear. Really nice food and Staff is very friendly and helpful. One of the best restaurants in the area of north Madrid.  You should give a try to this place."
ChIJ5dDMCNooQg0RkashKdvMOx4,5,Amazing food and service. Quality for the price is awsome. The food is so good! I Will repeat again!
ChIJ5dDMCNooQg0RkashKdvMOx4,5,Traditional Mexican restaurant. Food was authentic and servings were generous. Staff was attentive.
ChIJbwTpQiApQg0RN48pbK0fvwo,5,"From a month of traveling in Spain, I may have had my best meal yet here. Excellent service; the waiter patiently explained the menu in English. And the food was superb, very worth the price.

Recommended dishes:
Verduritas de la Huerta
Conchinillo"
ChIJbwTpQiApQg0RN48pbK0fvwo,5,"Una Gran Casa de Comida desde 1932  ...Lugar √âpico! Epic ""food house"" since 1932! Great good and Great service. Definitely worth a visit
..call ahead and reserve!"
ChIJbwTpQiApQg0RN48pbK0fvwo,5,One of the best meals I've ever had in Madrid.  It's where the locals go to eat.  Fabulous food and staff.  They treated us like family.  Such a memorable experience.
ChIJbwTpQiApQg0RN48pbK0fvwo,5,"This was one of my husband's favorite restaurants in Madrid, he had exquisite taste for good food, unfortunately he passed away 3 years ago but every time someone goes to Madrid I highly recommend it, I will be traveling to Madrid next week looking forward to having lunch there.
Bernabe Ruiz Saenz I will always carry your tradition"
ChIJbwTpQiApQg0RN48pbK0fvwo,1,"We were a group of ill-advised musicians, some friends told us that this was an iconic place, with a great atmosphere and we found ourselves in a sad place where only good food was served."
ChIJfeHwR9ooQg0RKSr_J2VTh70,5,"This place nails both style and substance. The decor is quite unique (with clothes and else hanging from the roof and other details which make the place cozy) and the device very welcoming.

The paella was one of the best I‚Äôve had‚Äîperfectly cooked rice but also the possibility to take several types of paella to share among us. The smoked salmon was incredible too, with a depth of flavor that makes sense once you learn the owner has Norwegian roots (or at least that‚Äôs what I understood).

A spot that feels special without trying too hard‚Äîdefinitely worth a visit!"
ChIJfeHwR9ooQg0RKSr_J2VTh70,5,"I have lived in Barcelona and traveled extensively  throughout Spain, believe me when I say that this is THE MOST EXQUISITE Paella I have tasted! The service is outstanding and the food is incredibly delicious. I don‚Äôt like cooked salmon but I devoured this one, enjoying each bite! MOST VISIT!"
ChIJfeHwR9ooQg0RKSr_J2VTh70,5,"Small and eclectic restaurant in Madrid that serves some of the best rice dishes in their own patented metal plate. The menu is short (5 starters and 7 main courses all rice or pasta) but all items are a must try. The house smoked salmon excels, served warm with an ultra crispy skin. All rice types are flavourful and cooked to perfection with a bit of socarrat (burnt rice). The service is very professional, attentive and friendly."
ChIJfeHwR9ooQg0RKSr_J2VTh70,5,"My tastebuds were blessed and brought to flavour town. Their butter was üëåüò©üëÖ. Honestly everything slaps so hard. Their paella? ‚ÄúSpectacular, give me 14 of them right now!!‚Äù Restaurant was also cute and cozy, it was an entire vibe ü´¶"
ChIJfeHwR9ooQg0RKSr_J2VTh70,5,"Lovely experience; very friendly staff and absolutely delicious food.

The smoked salmon is a house specialty and it was quite possibly the best bite of salmon I‚Äôve ever had.  The pasta and paellas we ordered were flavorful, unique and well prepared.

This place is a must if you‚Äôre ever in Madrid.

Chef Norberto even took the time to give us recommendations in other cities in Spain.

(There would be better pictures but the food was so delicious we ate it too quickly!)"
ChIJP2Wzrd4oQg0R9u59e6RsAqw,5,"recently had the pleasure of dining at Ancha, and it was absolutely amazing!

To start, we had the boletus and artichoke dish, which was incredibly flavorful and perfectly cooked, a delicious way to begin the meal. For the main course, we shared their signature Scaloppe Ancha, a generously portioned dish served with potatoes and onions. It‚Äôs perfect for two people and truly lived up to the restaurant‚Äôs reputation for this specialty!

The ambiance was equally fantastic, with a covered terrace that added to the overall dining experience.

If you‚Äôre looking for great food and a welcoming atmosphere, Ancha is a must-visit. Highly recommend it!"
ChIJP2Wzrd4oQg0R9u59e6RsAqw,5,"I had a great dinner at La Ancha where I shared the dishes within the table being able to try many options from the menu.

The butter done at the house is a great starter with the brand among many other interesting options.

We have had wine, beers and dinner and it should cost between EU50~75 per person pending on the dishes and drinks quantity.

The photo from the terrace indoor dinner does not represent very well the actual atmosphere which was very nice !!"
ChIJP2Wzrd4oQg0R9u59e6RsAqw,5,"Very nice experience in food tastes, creative chefs. Delicious, nice place and good atmosphere."
ChIJP2Wzrd4oQg0R9u59e6RsAqw,5,"I can't put into words just how incredible this dining experience was! The restaurant itself exudes elegance and sophistication, with its beautiful d√©cor creating the perfect ambiance. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable, especially with their spot-on wine recommendation. I absolutely loved my glass of Verdejo-such a delightful choice!
From the start, we were treated to a warm bread and butter that was simply divine-honestly, worth the visit on its own. For appetizers, we tried the crab salad. While it wasn't my personal favorite, my boyfriend loved it, which is one of the reasons he wanted to try this place.
Next up was the avocado salad, which quickly became my standout dish of the night. It was light, refreshing, and bursting with flavor-definitely not your average salad. I could've eaten it forever!
For the main course, we shared their signature Escalope Armando, and let me tell you, it's an absolute must-try. I'm not usually a fan of Milanese-style dishes, but this one was exceptional-thin, crispy, and not at all heavy. Paired with perfectly cooked potatoes and caramelized onions, it was nothing short of perfection.
To top it all off, we ended the meal with a delicious cup of coffee, the perfect way to close out such a memorable dining experience. I can't wait to return!"
ChIJP2Wzrd4oQg0R9u59e6RsAqw,5,"This is hands down THE BEST Spanish restaurant in Madrid - I do not give this review lightly as I have eaten at 100's of restaurants in Madrid. This place is fairly priced for the incredibly large portions and better than any restaurant you will eat at in Salamanca/ on C. de Jorge Juan.

The vibe of the restaurant is amazing, I love the outdoor area, makes me feel like I am eating in a cabin in Courchevel/St. Moritz/Kitzb√ºhel etc. The staff is incredibly friendly, you can easily communicate in English and they anticipate your needs before you ask.

The food portions are huge and so delicious. This is the only restaurant I have been to that offers delicious sites with an Escalope. I will have to return to try more items but this is what we ate and loved:
1. Caparr√≥s Salad
2. Escalope Armando
3. Beef meatballs

ChIJZdCt1N4oQg0RVXS7h6nkG3k,4,"Small restaurant with organic, natural wines.
Unique in Madrid. Small and nice. Great for an original plan and a quiet glass of wine.
Be careful, natural wines taste VERY different from what we are used to drinking.
Highly recommended."
ChIJZdCt1N4oQg0RVXS7h6nkG3k,5,"Totally recommended! The food, ideal to order several dishes and share. Excellent Kefta and creamy rice. And some fantastic natural wines. We have already repeated and we will return!"
ChIJZdCt1N4oQg0RVXS7h6nkG3k,5,"Brilliant! a great place to enjoy homemade, sophisticated and quality food at a more than reasonable price. I strongly recommend it, good customer service, a very nice terrace and the best wine in Madrid!!"
ChIJZdCt1N4oQg0RVXS7h6nkG3k,5,"How good the onion soup and ice cream were, for 11.95 euros you eat wonderfully.
The terrace is closed and there is an extensive wine list, although I do NOT drink alcohol."
ChIJZdCt1N4oQg0RVXS7h6nkG3k,5,With the little bistro it is the only place in Madrid to find natural wine. The food is truly excellent and the service impeccable. The prices are reasonable and it quickly became my canteen.
ChIJfarLAigpQg0RwfKZg4KXELk,5,"Very local spot with great food and service, and some real gems on the wine list. Definitely recommend, everything was great and the stuffed peppers will keep you coming back."
ChIJfarLAigpQg0RwfKZg4KXELk,5,"Best place, best owner, best food and the best chairmen I know!!!
We'll come back as soon as possible!!!!"
ChIJfarLAigpQg0RwfKZg4KXELk,5,Best traditional cuisine
ChIJfarLAigpQg0RwfKZg4KXELk,5,super
ChIJfarLAigpQg0RwfKZg4KXELk,4,"Restaurante cl√°sico vasco, que lleva much√≠simos a√±os funcionando bien.
Con una barra a la entrada y dos salones a los lados, que se llenan habitualmente. Tiene men√∫ diario y hasta 6 confeccionados, adem√°s de una amplia carta, bien atendidos en sala y con una cocina r√°pida. Buena relaci√≥n calidad precio. Imprescindible reservar"
ChIJf-XgMSEpQg0RhzOkFSp1F3Q,4,"A lovely Indian restaurant! We sat in the outdoor bell tent thing, which was beautifully decorated and had a couple of great musicians playing live Indian music, creating a really nice atmosphere. The food was very tasty overall. The curries were actually quite hot and spicy, which can be difficult to find in Madrid, and the naan was very nice. We were a bit disappointed with the onion bhajis, though. The service was friendly, albeit a bit slow. If you get the discount from the fork, the price is good. We would definitely go again"
ChIJf-XgMSEpQg0RhzOkFSp1F3Q,4,"I found out this was the first Indian restaurant in Madrid... It is tricky to find but the overall dinner experience was good. Food is very tasty and portions are usually larger than in other Indian places around the city. It could be pricey without a discount. The staff was very friendly and made sure everything was perfect. I'd recommend sitting in the ""tent"" they have across the main restaurant."
ChIJf-XgMSEpQg0RhzOkFSp1F3Q,4,"Very good food with right blend of aromatic spices, courteous service, beautiful decor truly representative of Indian culture, heritage, colors, flavours and more. Saffron walls, wooden furniture, maharaja portraits, soft folklore-inspired Bollywood songs or even live classical Indian music, artefacts from all over the country, all makes you feel at home."
ChIJf-XgMSEpQg0RhzOkFSp1F3Q,4,"The food was really authenticate with good service, and ambience (seating arrangements under the tent was something unique)...the quality was OK too..the prices are on the expensive side but you pay for the service, and quality of food..the only reason I‚Äôm not giving 5 stars rating is; Mango Lassi, it is no where close to what you expect in Lassi.."
ChIJf-XgMSEpQg0RhzOkFSp1F3Q,5,Nice indian food.. good ambience... tried mix vegetable n naan... taste was really good.. even the people serving were dressed in indian attire and place was also decorated with indian antique pieces and flowers.. must visit if you like indian curries and want to try out something picante!!
ChIJ1VxhmiApQg0RfYC2jZYjnVg,5,"It was a great dining experience. Coming from Ireland, we were looking forward to great Spanish food and we were greatly pleased with their food. Great atmosphere as well."
ChIJ1VxhmiApQg0RfYC2jZYjnVg,4,"Really good and solid place. A place with a  nice variety of traditional dishes from the north. I recommend this place hands down, the only issue is that the space is not that big and can get full easily."
ChIJ1VxhmiApQg0RfYC2jZYjnVg,5,Great spot for typical Basque cuisine
ChIJ1VxhmiApQg0RfYC2jZYjnVg,5,"The Basque restaurant serves delicious meals of the day. Not cheap but quality price is good as generous drink, bread, desert all is included."
ChIJ1VxhmiApQg0RfYC2jZYjnVg,4,Very good service. Food is very tasty. Its a resturant famous for la comida vasco. ( vasc food) . Will enjoy eating.
ChIJjeARfIAoQg0RPKowX6hOkg4,5,"We ordered the Argentinian hamburgers, French fries, and baked potatoes. You can tell that the quality of their ingredients was good. The female waiter who attended us was very efficient, attentive, and friendly."
ChIJjeARfIAoQg0RPKowX6hOkg4,5,"Good beef, super friendly people, fair pricing. This is a highly recommended Argentinian Restaurant in Madrid. Its atmosphere is a little casual but it‚Äôs OK."
ChIJjeARfIAoQg0RPKowX6hOkg4,5,Not a large place but the meat is delicious and the service friendly.  Decent wine list. They also have a decent understanding of English which was nice
ChIJjeARfIAoQg0RPKowX6hOkg4,5,"BEST CHIMICHURRI EVER. Really, the entrec√¥te was very tasty and with the chimichurri on top... it felt like heaven. Me and my wife had a wonderful dinner. Staff was also very friendly and smiley. We didnt have to wait much for our order either :) thanks a lot for all, my wife Yara and I will definetely recommend this place to everyone we know in madrid"
ChIJjeARfIAoQg0RPKowX6hOkg4,5,the food and the super friendly service of all of the staff was just amazing. best beef you can find!!
ChIJK9vpWdsoQg0RhrNmjxyNPgE,5,"Just landed in Madrid and a little earlier for the hotel. Came here for breakfast and holiday drinks excellent service, beautiful food and please try the little extras bits of tapas thay bring your way."
ChIJK9vpWdsoQg0RhrNmjxyNPgE,5,Excellent Terrace and Bar ! Friendly place. Good food and wine at reasonable prices. Best to go hungry as portions are very generous ! 100% recommended !!
ChIJK9vpWdsoQg0RhrNmjxyNPgE,5,Very friendly people. You'll get some tasty food besides your drink. üòâ
ChIJK9vpWdsoQg0RhrNmjxyNPgE,4,"We had the set menu but it was not what i was expecting.
I will go again and try foods that are not on the set menu."
ChIJK9vpWdsoQg0RhrNmjxyNPgE,5,"Lovely food, and superb wine, great atmosphere, made better by Tony our lovely host."
ChIJd6M8r94oQg0RwUOiAobTPIo,5,Absolutely wonderful and amazing from beginning to end. Worthy of their Michelin star rating. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. The ambience was lovely and and the food was outstanding!
ChIJd6M8r94oQg0RwUOiAobTPIo,5,"Wonderful experience, we arrived as the last table straight from the airport and had the opportunity to try a lot of different options still. All dishes are unique with a Spanish touch."
ChIJd6M8r94oQg0RwUOiAobTPIo,5,Easily the best meal of my life. Just spectacular. I really don‚Äôt know what else I can say about it.
ChIJd6M8r94oQg0RwUOiAobTPIo,5,"Fantastic culinary experience. The food was elevated, creative, and delicious. The presentation, especially of the appetizers, was extremely impressive and beautiful. The service was second to none - attentive, friendly, and professional.

Highly recommend eating here for a delicious and unique experience."
ChIJd6M8r94oQg0RwUOiAobTPIo,5,"First class restaurant experience with great service and adventurous food  with seasonal touchüôè

If you are looking for an unforgettable fine dining experience to remember in Madrid, this is the place to be. Three hours felt like an hour because you get a lot of input for all senses. It is wonderful to watch chefs preparing the food in front of customers at the ""kitchen stage"" in center of the beautifully decorated restaurant.

We especially enjoyed the beautiful starters and numerous tasty main courses with tuna, piglet and lam.  The wines were selected with ambition and expertise. The service was  attentive and fun üëç Muchos gracias!!"
ChIJO6IBv94oQg0RlWgvq7lbdkI,5,"As always, the food was good, the service was correct, and the ambience was comfortable. Cazorla is a typical spanish restaurant, serving ‚Äúcomida de toda la vida‚Äù, which never disappoints. My mother in law who lives in the neighborhood especially loves eating there. You can see only spanish families/group of friends eating there, so for me that‚Äôs the afirmation that the food is legit. I just got the chance to take picture of the fritura de pescado, or platter of fried fish/seafood. I missed the ensalada tomate con ventresca and the shells (I forgot the name)."
ChIJO6IBv94oQg0RlWgvq7lbdkI,4,"We visited Cazorla restaurant with my wife in October 2021, for a quick dinner. We were sitted outside, and it was a little bit cold.
We ordered Lubina a la espalda and Chuletitas de Cordero. Very good quality food. Perhaps too much garlic on the fish, but very nice.
I highly recommend this restaurant!"
ChIJO6IBv94oQg0RlWgvq7lbdkI,5,Really enjoyed the fresh pescadp frito and their steak. Decent prices and portion size. Nice and friendly staff. Typical Spanish food. Please note - they do not do Menu del Dia.
ChIJO6IBv94oQg0RlWgvq7lbdkI,5,"Excellent restaurant!! I‚Äôve been here several times and each time I leave so satisfied and happy. Food is delicious ,service is great and the place is pretty cozy and comfy!"
ChIJO6IBv94oQg0RlWgvq7lbdkI,1,I was here in Madrid I‚Äôm a pilipino service with the Filipino staff is very rude it take half hour food to be served even ur about to pay it take too much not recomended üò°üò°üò°
ChIJxUb2MtkoQg0RoqrH0lF4vtU,5,"Delicious food, amazing gluten-free beer and bread !! and the first class service ..."
ChIJxUb2MtkoQg0RoqrH0lF4vtU,2,"Food and drinks are fine. The issue here is  volume of clients, staff training and attitude. After waiting 10min in the table, while waiters wondered around without purpose we got serviced upon calling. The attitude was very disappointing.... Telling us like we are to blame for not calling them sooner. 2 thoughts: clearly the client is not number one for that waiter and she doesn't have any incentive to serve well but good will."
ChIJxUb2MtkoQg0RoqrH0lF4vtU,2,Poor service. Food is tasty but small portions.
ChIJxUb2MtkoQg0RoqrH0lF4vtU,3,Food ok. Service could be better organized. Would recommend just for a nice drink in the park.
ChIJxUb2MtkoQg0RoqrH0lF4vtU,5,Very nice place with English speaking personal and food not only containing meat.
ChIJy7vMKd8oQg0RMswRHKy_SEU,5,"Stumbled across here on the way to the metro and decided to pop in. It is an adorable little pub. It has that classic old pub vibe going for it. The landlord is friendly and the drinks are good.  There is a seating area downstairs as well.
The pub also has a cute little replica of itself above the stairs."
ChIJy7vMKd8oQg0RMswRHKy_SEU,5,"Great pub, especially if you want to watch a Celtic game while in Madrid. Very welcoming and the barman is the nicest guy."
ChIJy7vMKd8oQg0RMswRHKy_SEU,5,It's a lovely little pub with a lot of character which I went to with a few of my friends when we were in Madrid and it had a good selection of drinks and service was great.
ChIJy7vMKd8oQg0RMswRHKy_SEU,5,Beautiful pub with lots of hidden gems. Great atmosphere and selection of beer & spirits!
ChIJy7vMKd8oQg0RMswRHKy_SEU,5,"Great little pub, nice beer, and I haven't tried the food, so I can not comment. However, the menu did look good, nice friendly staff, and no I'm not a Rangers fan ü§£ü§£"
ChIJy7vMKd8oQg0RcLmmByfRO14,5,I really like the breakfast and the corner stay.
ChIJy7vMKd8oQg0RcLmmByfRO14,5,"The place was clean with natural light.  The food, as always, is tasty and delicious. The service was quick and easy. Thx."
ChIJy7vMKd8oQg0RcLmmByfRO14,5,"3B‚Äôs! Good food for the price. If you want to eat some veggies, this is the place."
ChIJy7vMKd8oQg0RcLmmByfRO14,4,Good sandwiches. Fast service. A good option for a quick meal or snack.
ChIJy7vMKd8oQg0RcLmmByfRO14,4,"Nice food, friendly service.
Not always true with Rodilla."
ChIJy9uLzdsoQg0RMbug7lZKaaw,5,Good coffee and home made bread. Especially Roscon! Looks like mixing old and new generation. Unique decortion. I like vibe in here.
ChIJy9uLzdsoQg0RMbug7lZKaaw,5,One of the best breakfast places in Madrid. Their carrot cake is really delicious and  toasts were amazing . Very homely cafe!
ChIJy9uLzdsoQg0RMbug7lZKaaw,2,The coffee tasted good. It would taste better if you stopped being fascists about the laptops.
ChIJy9uLzdsoQg0RMbug7lZKaaw,4,"Nice little neighbourhood cafe, good homemade cakes and slices."
ChIJy9uLzdsoQg0RMbug7lZKaaw,5,"Nice family-run Caf√©, with a very friendly service, located next to #ParqueBerlin
It's small and cosy, with homemade cakes and muffins, of a different kind, like avocado and chocolate cake. Their #CarrotCake its quite delicious. You can order beforehand to take home."
ChIJNaBxpd8oQg0R9-Rzl6uX-Gk,4,Great place to have drinks with friends. waiters are attentive. Food and drink prices reasonable.
ChIJNaBxpd8oQg0R9-Rzl6uX-Gk,5,"Excellent place to sit at a table on the sidewalk and enjoy delicious, freshly cut Jamon Iberico, tapas, and of course a cold beer. Very friendly waiters, quick service. We came back the following day and bought 3 packs of this Iberico to take home as gifts. It is not cheap, but the quality is excellent."
ChIJNaBxpd8oQg0R9-Rzl6uX-Gk,5,"BEST HAM EVER. Even the service at the bar was amazing. If you are looking for authentic tapas and jamon Iberico, this would be THE place to go. The ambiance is casual and you will likely find yourself among Madrid locals having a few drinks after work."
ChIJNaBxpd8oQg0R9-Rzl6uX-Gk,5,One of the best places for Spanish cured meats and cheeses.  Everything from the Extremadura region and simply outstanding quality.  One of my favorite places in Madrid.
ChIJNaBxpd8oQg0R9-Rzl6uX-Gk,4,Very good selection of dried ham
ChIJwzuwetsoQg0RBtf3Iu9eY9E,4,Tasty food but service could be improved (our drinks were wrong and we had to ask to set up the table)
ChIJwzuwetsoQg0RBtf3Iu9eY9E,1,"Is this really now a portion of ‚Ç¨15.50? Considering, furthermore, that what is said from the kitchen can be heard in the room, when you are asked if this is a portion, I would have expected another answer or, before taking out the scarce product, to have indicated to the customer that they did not have it and offered us other possibilities. And on top of that they were cold inside!! This has never happened to me. I have been embarrassed, but the local staff has none. We half ate it for the ‚Ç¨15.50 it cost. Obviously, I won't be back. I remembered this dish and the place with pleasure. Now it's a boring snack dinner to erase from memory."
ChIJwzuwetsoQg0RBtf3Iu9eY9E,5,"Small but very cozy place. Close to the Metro, and the National Auditorium. All delicious, but I especially recommend the cod fritters, which are delicious. You have to reserve because there are few tables, but those who sit at them, and even those who have a drink at the bar, all leave the place with happy faces. Highly, highly recommended."
ChIJwzuwetsoQg0RBtf3Iu9eY9E,5,"After a fun and magical afternoon in the Houdini Room, we gained strength in this pleasant restaurant. The attention was great. We ordered several portions and they were all delicious."
ChIJwzuwetsoQg0RBtf3Iu9eY9E,1,"Terrible attention from the staff, very unpleasant. When they entered they were mopping the floor. We asked if we could come in even though we saw that there was a couple at the bar. We told them we wanted to sit down for dinner and the response from the waitress who was cleaning up was that everything was reserved for the 9pm dinners and it had to be at the bar.  A few minutes later customers began to arrive and coincidentally none of them had made a reservation, they were seated in the dining area that was supposedly fully reserved; and those who were supposed to have made a reservation were never asked for their information to verify it. Conclusion, it was a lie and the tables were not reserved but this way they save having to prepare them again for the next customer. We will not return. The only positive thing is that the fritters were very good."
ChIJXY1OmN8oQg0RoLhwDmmGOuA,5,"I get weekly takeaway pizza here and I love it, always absolutely delicious, ready in a couple of minutes, and they offer vegan cheese!"
ChIJXY1OmN8oQg0RoLhwDmmGOuA,3,Great pizza but the dgas attitude of the staff let's it down
ChIJXY1OmN8oQg0RoLhwDmmGOuA,5,Pizza was so good and bathroom was very clean!
ChIJXY1OmN8oQg0RoLhwDmmGOuA,1,"I came tonight to order some pizza which was first off all very oily, it felt dirty. That didn‚Äôt make me as mad as there service the manager was very rude and stubborn. He did not want to take are order and when we ordered the pizza wasn‚Äôt hot anymore he just kept it with him to make us more mad. I‚Äôve never had an experience as bad as this in papa john."
ChIJXY1OmN8oQg0RoLhwDmmGOuA,1,"they are always late on delivery.. the last time we ordered, it turned out a fiasco!! we ordered over the phone around 8:50pm and it was already 11:30pm and the pizza havent arrived yet.. the worst of this experience was when we called to claim our order, they told us that they didnt made our order yet, and they still ask me if i still want the pizza!!! üò§üò§ it was valentines day, imagine it!!! üòñ i love papa johns, but not here!! no no, not anymore!!"
ChIJmyj1_dooQg0RtJP28zMLynE,5,If you want something good this is the place to go. Great grilled asado and outstanding desserts from Argentina
ChIJmyj1_dooQg0RtJP28zMLynE,4,"We had dinner at Tanguito on a week day, we were the first customer of the service. Entering the venue we found it a bit wear out and not really cozy. At first we were not impressed at all, we decided to order a mixed grill and some fires. Well, meat was great and the price was also really reasonable! We will repeat!"
ChIJmyj1_dooQg0RtJP28zMLynE,5,Very nice place and really good food. The staff is very careful and the quality/price is awesome. The best restaurant in the area.
ChIJmyj1_dooQg0RtJP28zMLynE,4,Menu very good value for money and food very tasty.
ChIJmyj1_dooQg0RtJP28zMLynE,5,Best Pizza in the world ü•∞
ChIJhf6kFtsoQg0RbQcE-EZZF7c,5,Good sushi for a good price. I ordered for take away and it was prepared quickly. The sushi tastes fresh and the employee was friendly.
ChIJhf6kFtsoQg0RbQcE-EZZF7c,5,"very quiet, friendly service and good quality food. Strongly recommend!"
ChIJhf6kFtsoQg0RbQcE-EZZF7c,3,"Expensive sushi, slopperly prepared"
ChIJhf6kFtsoQg0RbQcE-EZZF7c,5,"Very good place to eat sushi, sashimi and Japanese food in general. The food is very delicious and the service is very friendly. The sushi and sashimi trays are highly recommended. They have Japanese beer. Small but cozy place. Access is a little difficult since you have to go down stairs. It is difficult to park in the area and it is in the S.E.R. area. green, although just a couple of blocks away there is also a blue zone."
ChIJhf6kFtsoQg0RbQcE-EZZF7c,5,"I had a fantastic experience at Yu Sushi. The food is extremely fresh and of the best quality. Every bite is a delight, from the sashimis to the rolls. In addition, the atmosphere is cozy and the staff is very friendly and attentive. It is definitely a place I will return to. Highly recommended for sushi lovers! üç£"
ChIJbx_tX98oQg0RNScXmBfKM1A,5,"Madrid does a lot of things well. It‚Äôs a city of three million people that somehow still feels laid-back, where the bars are tucked into corners like old friends waiting for you to drop by. There‚Äôs no pressure. No rushing. Just a quiet nod from the barman, a cold beer appearing moments later, and the unspoken agreement that you‚Äôll settle up whenever you feel like it. It makes you want to visit more.

And so, in that spirit, we found ourselves at La Escalera, stopping in for a pre-dinner drink. It‚Äôs the sort of place Madrid excels at‚Äîsmall, welcoming, effortlessly cool without trying. There‚Äôs a warmth to it, a glow from the low lights and the clink of glasses, the kind of bar where you sit down for one and end up staying for four.

The beer is cold, the wine is good, and the service is exactly as it should be‚Äîattentive but unhurried, as if they know you‚Äôre not going anywhere fast. And you shouldn‚Äôt. If you find yourself in the area, I‚Äôd recommend it. Not because it‚Äôs the best bar in Madrid, but because it‚Äôs exactly the sort of bar that makes Madrid the best."
ChIJbx_tX98oQg0RNScXmBfKM1A,5,"Best place in town, highly recommended."
ChIJbx_tX98oQg0RNScXmBfKM1A,3,"Good food but poor service inside. We wanted to sit inside upstairs and got ignored after the initial drink order whilst the waiter was doing anything but taking our order for well over 20 minutes (at the end one of us had to go down to ask for them to take our order, as our clear signals for them to notice us were ignored as well).
The food itself was good, the place has a good cook.
Please note that the opening times are not correct if you are interested in eating here (7.30 p.m. was the time the kitchen opened).

Edit: This was the place we were at. I changed it to 7.30 p.m. in my text but it still dosen't match to the opening times on Google (opening times do not match kitchen hours). To be fair this was not the only restaurant which was open but not for food (seems to be a general issue in Madrid/Spain)."
ChIJbx_tX98oQg0RNScXmBfKM1A,4,Small corner tavern - restaurant.  Only one server who focused mostly on his largest table and had to be called for service.  Calimari and octopus were both excellent.
ChIJbx_tX98oQg0RNScXmBfKM1A,5,"We went for my wife's birthday celebration. We love the food and arrangement. Dishes are realy delicious, especially octopus is INCREDIBLE."
ChIJcRC_RycpQg0R2YzZj4thi9E,4,"It is a chain restaurant, but they offered quality food with very reasonable price."
ChIJcRC_RycpQg0R2YzZj4thi9E,5,"Great and affordable bar chain in Madrid! Probably with spain!

The best Value for money and relaxed area for spending ling time enjoying drinks drinks drinks and spanish patatas!

Friendly staff!"
ChIJcRC_RycpQg0R2YzZj4thi9E,4,"Nice tapas and very affordable drinks and dishes. Recommend to go with friends if you don‚Äôt wanna spend lots of money, there are all over the city"
ChIJcRC_RycpQg0R2YzZj4thi9E,5,"What a fantastic experience. 2 euro for Heineken and you get to sit longside monseigneurs eating scones at 11am while you throw back your 7th pint that cost you 2 quid.
Friendly service from the Spanish men who knew the craic. Language is no barrier to porter. Hail hail"
ChIJcRC_RycpQg0R2YzZj4thi9E,3,"It's economic. The bread is good, the other ingredients are good. The waitress was extremely cute in his inability to understand english or italian but we understand each other. A big smile for this beautiful girl that work there."
ChIJ0fEz3dAoQg0RwUMeUmQp0uw,5,"Great discovery! Nice flavor combinations in all the dishes, great attention from the staff, we liked the lamb tartare the most
Fair prices
Recommended"
ChIJ0fEz3dAoQg0RwUMeUmQp0uw,5,"This unassuming restaurant with a very un-Asian name hides a wonderful Thai/Asian cuisine which is outstanding. Service is excellent, the food wonderful. We had some Baos and spring rolls to start with followed by green curry and langostines satay and creme brulee to share as dessert. Not cheap at ‚Ç¨45 per head (no wine) but excellent cuisine. Need to reserve."
ChIJ0fEz3dAoQg0RwUMeUmQp0uw,5,"¬°Que maravilla! A little corner of Thailand/Malaysia in Prosperidad!
The place is quiet and with a lovely decor, the service is absolutely incredible and the food‚Ä¶ death by deliciousness!!!
First and foremost I would like to praise our host, who was extremely careful in explaining all the dishes and on recommending combinations: great job. We left very satisfied!
The cocktails (spicy margaritas) were very good, and marvellously complemented the  little amuse bouche (a red pepper, ginger and coconut soup).
For starters we got the salmon pani puri (welcome to Bangkok meets Mumbai‚Ä¶ a dream!) which were absolutely delicious: crunchy shell, chewy filling and creamy top. Delicioso!
Then we had then peking duck rolls with mango sauce: do yourself a favour and order these first. They were absolute highlight of the evening - I had only ever had fresh peking duck spring rolls and these are fried, very interesting and very tasty! My only suggestion would be to increase a little the prune content, but otherwise perfect.
As a main dish we shared the laksa, which was very good but the absolute star of it was a handful of raw clams. I never considered this combo and man‚Ä¶ they were so fresh and almost creamy, adding a taste of ocean to an already flavourful dish!
Lastly my partner had the cr√®me br√ªl√©e with lime sorbet (I ended having the sorbet) and it was also delicious.
The whole meal was about 100euro for two, which I think is on the pricy side for Madrid (especially not in the centre) but if you want a taste of south east Asia within the metro 4 route‚Ä¶ this is your spot!"
ChIJ0fEz3dAoQg0RwUMeUmQp0uw,5,Came here through a friend's recommendation. The food is fantastic and the vibe is very laid back. Service is on point. I appreciate this place for its simple good cooking thats well executed. Nothing fancy but bold and delicious flavors. See you again soon
ChIJ0fEz3dAoQg0RwUMeUmQp0uw,5,This restaurant is a jewel. Every dish is exquisite. The flavors are mouthwatering and appealing even to the most delicate of palates. The service is excellent and the ambiance caters to all occasions. Worth seeking out to experience Thai haute cuisine.
ChIJAwZqfdAoQg0R6u4tG1cgVQE,5,Very nice atmosphere. Tasty food at low prices. The owner is very polite and sympatic. We came late but they still prepared food for us.
ChIJAwZqfdAoQg0R6u4tG1cgVQE,5,Very tasty üëç
ChIJAwZqfdAoQg0R6u4tG1cgVQE,5,"Hemos estado hoy de comida familiar, despu√©s de conocer el local gracias a la cena de navidad del trabajo. Lugar exquisito, delicadeza m√°xima por parte de sus trabajadores. Te tratan con mucho respeto y educaci√≥n. La comida esta riqu√≠sima, he pedido de primero unas Verdinas con almajas y Calamar. Y de segundo unas cocochas de bacalao. Y de postre leche frita.  Este √∫ltimo,al igual que el resto maravilloso. Sales muy lleno.
De entrantes y con la bebida, ponen torreznos, aceitunas y croquetas.
Cuidan al todos los detalles. Al igual que los chupitos de crema, hierbas y pacharan al terminar.
Lugar entra√±able y mas que apuntado para volver."
ChIJAwZqfdAoQg0R6u4tG1cgVQE,5,"Excellent in all details. A simple and familiar place where they serve in that pleasant, helpful and super professional way of life. You are at home, in a very homely, very calm atmosphere and where you also eat simple and excellent traditional food like that of God's lifelong grandmothers. Very beautiful all the decoration of landscape paintings and impressionist canvases. Excellent Galician broth, stews, beans, croquettes and excellent pickled trout. It is one of the first places where I order fish and they give me fish cover. In addition, there was also, without needing to ask, a knife to cut meat. There is an incomprehensible mania to always use, no matter what you order, knives that are exclusively for spreading and I will never understand why. There were also chopsticks on the table, another very useful thing that you don't usually see unless you ask for it. There are plenty of desserts and the Delta coffee they serve is great."
ChIJAwZqfdAoQg0R6u4tG1cgVQE,5,"Everything was great, the food was great, and the service was 10. We went with the two grandmothers and my two children, one of them 2 years old, and the staff was very attentive to us. The only bad thing I would say is that at that moment the glass door to the terrace, which was surely automatic, was broken, and cold air was leaking into the closed terrace, but nothing that cannot be remedied. Thank you very much for the service!"
ChIJfxolBNEoQg0R1TGWILhj0X8,5,"Great place for a Doner Kebab. Went here for my first ever meal in Madrid. Keep coming back to this place since then.
Portion size is good."
ChIJfxolBNEoQg0R1TGWILhj0X8,4,"Great place for a Doner Kebab. Went here for my first ever meal in Madrid. Keep coming back to this place since then.
Portion size is good.
I would wish if they could give the sauces separately from the fries and not on top but difficult to talk if you are not a fluent Spanish speaker."
ChIJfxolBNEoQg0R1TGWILhj0X8,5,"Very Nice Environment.
Service is very fast & good.
Food is delicious & tasty."
ChIJfxolBNEoQg0R1TGWILhj0X8,5,best quality food .Really hot and delicious . great customer service . recom everyone to have a try.
ChIJfxolBNEoQg0R1TGWILhj0X8,5,"Very nice and lovely food and great value for money I visited many times good service and staff also nice
Highly recommend."
ChIJRSbMCNEoQg0Rv-zIy01_flU,5,A large selection of dishes and drinks. I especially liked the fresh pastries
ChIJRSbMCNEoQg0Rv-zIy01_flU,5,"Visiting Madrid? Don't miss this place.
Best Spanish omelette in Madrid  - and the callos? (Tripe) As seen in the photo)- you'll want to know how to make it! It's super difficult so maybe easier if take some back home !"
ChIJRSbMCNEoQg0Rv-zIy01_flU,5,Sip! Buena tortilla! Great Spanish omelette and great orange juice. Good value for money too.
ChIJRSbMCNEoQg0Rv-zIy01_flU,3,Very small but good coffee
ChIJRSbMCNEoQg0Rv-zIy01_flU,5,"A few days ago we visited this bar after hearing several recommendations about its famous potato omelette. I went with my partner and my guide dog, and from the first moment we felt very well received. Both the waitress, the waiter and the cook served us with great kindness, creating a cozy and pleasant atmosphere.

The place is small but charming, ideal to enjoy a quiet and close experience. The service was excellent, with helpful and very professional treatment. We tried the potato omelette in two versions, with onion and without onion, and also some croquettes. Everything was so delicious that we ended up repeating it several times.

Without a doubt, if we return to Madrid, this bar will be a mandatory stop. Highly recommended!"
ChIJLz_iMNooQg0RwNrJzfPACps,5,"Pulled pork was the choice, a small was the size but perfect it looked and so did it taste. The lady serving was great too as with the dining area, very fresh and clean. Napoli would be proud üòÅ"
ChIJLz_iMNooQg0RwNrJzfPACps,4,"Very nice pizza! I tried the Margherita DOP this time, and I'm looking forward to coming back to try some others with more toppings and flavors"
ChIJLz_iMNooQg0RwNrJzfPACps,5,Delicious pizza and fantastic service! I ordered my pizza in person and it only took them 10/15 minutes until it was ready. Staff were very friendly. Highly recommend Margherita DOP (in the picture).
ChIJLz_iMNooQg0RwNrJzfPACps,5,Best pizza place in Madrid. I had the special pizza and a green salad and it was outstanding. Very genuine and great quality. Highly recommended for take out or for a quick bite in.
ChIJLz_iMNooQg0RwNrJzfPACps,5,We really enjoyed so much!!! Everything was perfect and so testy!!! Thank you
ChIJF8ErB9EoQg0RsPECezgqQAs,3,"I love the cheese fries at Fosters, but I hated this location. First of all it looks dirty on the outside and the inside. Second of all, the cheese fries here were SO TINY! Im used to getting these huge portion of cheese fries but for some reason the portion here was way smaller than I was used to. The taste didnt vary too much from other Foster locations I am used to, but the portion just made me disapointed."
ChIJF8ErB9EoQg0RsPECezgqQAs,3,"Service was very slow, but it has improved lately. Clear candidate to an upgrade in the future. They have a 15% discount voucher for lunch menu if you work in a nearby company."
ChIJF8ErB9EoQg0RsPECezgqQAs,3,Good good but slow
ChIJF8ErB9EoQg0RsPECezgqQAs,1,"It took more than an hour to serve us the food. My burger arrived cold and was missing bacon. I don't understand how it can take 70 minutes to serve a burger and it isn't freshly made. I didn't file a claim because I was in a hurry, not because they didn't deserve it."
ChIJF8ErB9EoQg0RsPECezgqQAs,3,"The restaurant is very good but the service is extremely slow.
Don't go if you are in a hurry."
ChIJZ_O4dNUoQg0R3v_dGXljaqk,5,"5 stars for the owner and the entire staff. Very friendly and helpful. We sat outside but the heating was so good that it kept us warm even at 1 degree.

The food menu was diverse. We went specifically for the indo-chinese food. And it was worth it... I don't know of any other restaurant in Madrid that has such authentic Indo Chinese food... Definitely going back for the chicken lollipop ü§©
I already have my eye on the chhole bhature for next time...
Bar menu is also quite good.
The best part was the sizzling mithai platter....a very new and interesting concept for me...

Overall a definite 5 star for everything...
I am sooo glad to have found this place"
ChIJZ_O4dNUoQg0R3v_dGXljaqk,5,"Very authentic food made by a skilled authentic chef. Lots of variety in the menu and food is made with fresh ingredients. The naans are so delicious with the correct texture and quality, you feel like you are in Delhi. We ended up having dinner at this restaurant or ordering it almost everyday during our trip to Madrid. Their Ras malai and gulab jamun are made fresh and gets sold out soon. We were so into the food that every time we forgot to take a picture."
ChIJZ_O4dNUoQg0R3v_dGXljaqk,4,"Proper indian food, the chefs were actually indian.

I had the chilli paneer, makhni daal and garlic naan. Super generous portions, if you are dining alone be prepared to take the leftovers with you.

I will go back before leaving Madrid."
ChIJZ_O4dNUoQg0R3v_dGXljaqk,5,"It was a very nice experience. They even did pooja to Ganesh while we were there and we got prasad.
Many options to choose from. The food is delicious."
ChIJZ_O4dNUoQg0R3v_dGXljaqk,5,"Can't imagine we had not bumped into this place in the last one year.. Found this place by a random recommendation on facebook.. What pulled us was this was the only place that offered Indo-Chinese in Madrid (yes Indo-Chinese is a thing). Absolutely in love with the taste, ""apnapan"" and spice this place had to offer.. Definitely going back again..."
ChIJ1Y-qptEoQg0R885HiyBJk7I,5,Great small place.   Wine was $3 a glass. The same wine would be $20+ a glass in the US.  We probably ordered to much as we did not know the system.   Very enjoyable overall.  I recommend the mushrooms.  The lamb brain was also cooked perfectly.
ChIJ1Y-qptEoQg0R885HiyBJk7I,5,Quaint little bar. Best fried aubergines and boquerones. Friendly service. Will return.
ChIJ1Y-qptEoQg0R885HiyBJk7I,5,Small traditional bar with delicious food and good beer
ChIJ1Y-qptEoQg0R885HiyBJk7I,5,"Classic bar, one of those that no longer exists. Two professionals at the helm, who couldn't be more friendly and helpful. Excellent product and cuisine: breaded eggplants, grilled mushrooms, meat cubes with fried potatoes and padr√≥n peppers, fried anchovies, salad, etc. To repeat and repeat."
ChIJ1Y-qptEoQg0R885HiyBJk7I,4,Small but charming bar. The eggplants are spectacular.
ChIJz-w9XdEoQg0RBifDvsKYlAk,4,It's a nice place. Coffe and bakery are Okey. the price is a little bit high but you have many options to choose to eat something good and looks really nice. Recommend
ChIJz-w9XdEoQg0RBifDvsKYlAk,5,"Excellent croissants and coffee.
My Spanish is poor but the waitress was kind and patient trying to understand what I wanted.
The decor is nice.
Another review complained about the staff not using gloves but it seems this has been addressed now."
ChIJz-w9XdEoQg0RBifDvsKYlAk,4,Nice place with great coffee and nice staff
ChIJz-w9XdEoQg0RBifDvsKYlAk,5,"Well I ordered a toasted breakfast + coffee ‚òïÔ∏è I really loved everything, it was delicious
Good atmosphere everything in its clean organized place
Super good prices I recommend it 100%"
ChIJz-w9XdEoQg0RBifDvsKYlAk,3,"Good coffee in a place without personality. It doesn't seem cheap to me to pay ‚Ç¨1.80 for a coffee at a self-service store where you have to pick up the coffee on a tray and bring it to the table yourself. If you save on staff, then you should not charge the same as in a traditional place where you sit down and the waiter serves you. I will only return if I find myself in a hurry and in a hurry in the area. I certainly don't recommend it."
ChIJ-96vQtEoQg0RUmynxP-jK10,1,"The most horrible burger I‚Äôve ever ate in my life.
The fries were dry, we couldn‚Äôt have a single bite of it.
The burger was simply tasteless and horrible
with lots of of mayonnaise, giving us a heartburn."
ChIJ-96vQtEoQg0RUmynxP-jK10,5,"It was a cold evening in late December... my lady was craving some chicken nuggets and so I decided to adventure myself in this newly opened McDonald's very close to our new place. The moon was full, and so was the Mc, but I figured ""Won't take that long no?"". I was wrong, horribly wrong. I was able to order right away, at 21.02. I then patiently put myself aside to wait and, by surprise, look at chaos unfolding right underneath my eyes. 21.35, the poor manager comes out to say that the systems had gone down and if, by any chance, someone had been waiting for more than 10 minutes: people rolled their eyes, started praying and some of them got pissy at the poor guy.
Fast-forward another 35minutes, and I'm finally getting my order from 21.02, exactly 1h and 10 minutes after I got here. I'm happy. My lady is happy, although probably asleep on the sofa. People around me are looking at my food with devil eyes, full of hatred and envy. I finally manage to exit the place and, with relief, I breathe in the cold breeze once again.

That being said, food was good, the personel was trying their best to keep up with the orders and ended up gifting us 4 nuggets.
It's always tough to start a new job, no matter the workplace, and I wish the customers I shared my adventure with yesterday would have been more understanding about it.
Good luck!"
ChIJ-96vQtEoQg0RUmynxP-jK10,1,Avoid this place unless you can wait for an hour to get a ‚Äúfast food‚Äù order. They‚Äôre slower than a week in jail at this location.
ChIJ-96vQtEoQg0RUmynxP-jK10,1,"I placed an order and watched for it to be called, it was not, then after a considerable time I went to ask, they gave me my order that had been sitting going cold for a long time, when I asked for a fresh order they told me no because they said they called my number and I didn't pick it up which was not ture, I then again asked for a fresh order and they said no,I left without anything after paying for a meal, worst experience ever, ill never go back, just wanted to add to this even after paying and not getting anything, Mac Donald's have not responded to my review, interesting eh?"
ChIJ-96vQtEoQg0RUmynxP-jK10,1,"Worst McDonald‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever been to.
The fries are always really dry, doubt they ever change the oil.
They also take super long to prepare the food. Food is tasteless compared to other McDonald‚Äôs üòí."
ChIJ3ZP7xNMoQg0RuCX4dZREclI,5,Value for money !! just $1 euro on every wednesday and sunday.  Strongly recommend !
ChIJ3ZP7xNMoQg0RuCX4dZREclI,5,A fast food done right the mpntaditoa accessible price and amazing flavor makes it a fan favourite while in Spain or anywhere they have franchises
ChIJ3ZP7xNMoQg0RuCX4dZREclI,5,"Great place for sandwich tapas. Of course everyone in Spain already knows this, but this location is particularly nice as there is ample outdoor seating.  Definitely go on Wednesday and Sundays when all sandwiches are ‚Ç¨1!"
ChIJ3ZP7xNMoQg0RuCX4dZREclI,5,"Good food, excellent prices, serves food all day."
ChIJ3ZP7xNMoQg0RuCX4dZREclI,2,Cheap. Good if you want a fast food experience. Choose somewhere else if you're looking for Authentic Spanish tapas and atmosphere.
ChIJy1cZftYoQg0R7VhlDVV85ms,5,"The food was amazing , super fair prices but the best was the service. The waitors are amazing and super kind, very fast service and clean space"
ChIJy1cZftYoQg0R7VhlDVV85ms,5,"Fantastic, fresh, flavorful food! The menu degustaci√≥n is a great option. The staff were passionate, knowledgeable and helpful. After the main courses we stayed and were offered more tea and desserts on the house. A wonderful experience, highly recommended."
ChIJy1cZftYoQg0R7VhlDVV85ms,3,"I had high expectations given its rating and it turned out a bit of a disappointment.
Food is extremely average and so is the service. Nothing outstanding nor worth recommending.
Far better options in Madrid."
ChIJy1cZftYoQg0R7VhlDVV85ms,5,"The food was absolutely amazing‚Äîauthentic Lebanese cuisine at its finest. The staff were incredibly kind and welcoming, and I truly appreciated their hospitality. We visited today, December 28, 2024, and had a wonderful experience‚Ä¶Highly recommended!

Thank you,
Ahmed"
ChIJy1cZftYoQg0R7VhlDVV85ms,1,"We were very disappointed... the food has nothing to do with lebanese food.
We ordered salads like Hummus (very bad) was eating something like cream, nothing to do with Hommos, the salads in general was very bad and the main course, chicken breast on grill my wife couldn't eat it, I tried to have a try was really bad!

Very disappointed, in general I Don't like to post and complain, I normally keep it for my self, but it's important that others know, so that dosn't happen to them as it did for us."
ChIJdQcgENMoQg0R8x4B6jiuEwg,5,"Best arroz I've tried in Madrid so far. Kind service, good price and a perfect rice Se√±oret. It's a typical restaurant, it has become a must-go when visitors come."
ChIJdQcgENMoQg0R8x4B6jiuEwg,5,"A very good restaurant where the food tastes amazingly good, the portions are really big and the price is very good."
ChIJdQcgENMoQg0R8x4B6jiuEwg,5,The best place for paella and fish dishes. It's a must on Sunday lunch.
ChIJdQcgENMoQg0R8x4B6jiuEwg,5,Get your authentic paella here. Enough said.
ChIJdQcgENMoQg0R8x4B6jiuEwg,5,Excellent seafood and rice dishes. Friendly and fast service with great advise on croquettes and paella dishes ü•ò
ChIJpQ4GGdMoQg0RNsyucjE67qs,5,THE AUTHENTIC ITALIAN PIZZA...FROM ONLY ‚Ç¨4.95
ChIJe7ZtgtooQg0RLUmtM7p3E58,4,"No frills eating, but authentic, home-made Asturian fare. The cachopos are delicious."
ChIJe7ZtgtooQg0RLUmtM7p3E58,1,"Hello, good evening, mainly home delivery is very slow, on top of that you call the establishment, and the girl who picks up the phone, instead of saying ‚Äúsorry, the schedule was wrong, there was a problem‚Äù, (after waiting 45 minutes late from the approximate delivery time), speaks to you in a tone that is inappropriate for a job facing the PUBLIC. Then, you pay ‚Ç¨20 for a cachopo without ham??????  You ask for a complaint form and they don't have it, after the derogatory tone towards me.
I don't know if this is your place, but if it is, you should treat the people who feed you better. And if you don't respect the owner, he surely wants you to be nice to his customers.
The potatoes, apart from having a green tone, many were burnt on the outside and raw on the inside or soggy, I don't know.
The salad already smelled a lot like expired mayonnaise, I almost vomited when I opened the container. But when you opened it there was MEAT?????????  I attach photos of the show.
As if that were not enough, you ask him for plastic cutlery and he tells you ‚ÄúI don't have any because it's Sunday.‚Äù
Good evening and thanks for the education."
ChIJe7ZtgtooQg0RLUmtM7p3E58,3,"The place is small but cozy (between 7 and 9 tables). It is the same owner who had ""El Raitan"" before. The Owner is very friendly. 4 of us have gone with Groupon:
- Starters (Chorizos with Cider, Cabrales Potatoes, Fabada, Asturian Mushrooms or Salad).
- Main (Cachopo to share between 2 or ""Ham and Cheese"" or ""Cecina y Queso"") and then for ‚Ç¨1 more, you can add ingredients.
- Dessert (Rice pudding and Cheesecake).
The portion of chorizos is a little small but quite good, the portion of Cabrales potatoes is very good, very good. The Cachopos for two people are very good, they are large (although I have seen larger ones for less ‚Ç¨), the one that only had ham and cheese was better made than the one from Cabrales, which was a little overcooked, but the one from Cabrales has more flavor. The dessert portion is good, the Cheesecake was very delicious and the Rice Pudding, although it was also delicious, was a little more ""salty"". In general, a very good experience, we will surely repeat it, either in the restaurant or at home (the owner told us that they send menus to homes through Just Eat, Deliberoo, Uber Eat and Glovo)."
ChIJe7ZtgtooQg0RLUmtM7p3E58,5,"They just opened in the area recently. I have to say that it is eaten like at home. Unbeatable price quality. Everything done at the moment, and it shows. The Cabrales potatoes are delicious and the cachopo is delicious, both the cured meat and the serrano ham. 100% exquisite recommendable and we will definitely repeat."
ChIJe7ZtgtooQg0RLUmtM7p3E58,5,"Impressive ham cachopo with Cabrales cheese and as a starter some Asturian mushrooms with brutal Peral cheese cream. If you are looking for authentic Asturian homemade food (with cider), highly recommended. Small place without frills, intimate and perfect for a dinner with friends. The service of exceptional friendliness and professionalism."
ChIJZy73JSYpQg0RhXpFCgmHYgY,4,A pleasant tiled eaterie on a quiet alleyway near Colombia metro. Only had tapas there but judging by those it's probably a good place to dine
ChIJZy73JSYpQg0RhXpFCgmHYgY,5,Excellent local restaurant that focuses on good ingredients and Andalucian cuisine.
ChIJZy73JSYpQg0RhXpFCgmHYgY,5,Gets easily crowded in the weekends but worth the wait.
ChIJZy73JSYpQg0RhXpFCgmHYgY,5,"My wife and I had dinner at Los Pescaitos. We were very happy with the food and service. Alvaro was very cordial and took the time to explain Andalusian food in general and some traditions (such as Toros). We ordered the tuna belly salad, the crispy shrimp, a few more and of course, the sardinas asadas! Delicious is an insufficient word to describe our eating experience! We alwwre so happy, and would definitely return to Los Pescaitos in our next trip. Muchas Gracias!!"
ChIJZy73JSYpQg0RhXpFCgmHYgY,4,I enjoyed this restaurant because i could see that the restaurant's food was very good. I liked it all however everytime i go to this restaurant the service is SO SLOW. I have to wait so much that i order two o three baskets of bread because i'm starving. But overall the prices are great and I can eat anything that has sea food from Paella to Chipirrones. Great FOOD.
ChIJIwOPjywvQg0Re4c0RX-ejJQ,4,Economical place to grab a decent bite to eat. Good service.
ChIJIwOPjywvQg0Re4c0RX-ejJQ,5,Best bar in Madrid
ChIJIwOPjywvQg0Re4c0RX-ejJQ,5,"A good place to have some very delicious and generous tapas or toast at a good price. I recommend the foie toast.  It's run by two very nice Chinese people, they are alone and sometimes the service is a little slow, but it's worth it."
ChIJIwOPjywvQg0Re4c0RX-ejJQ,5,"Good preparation of Cuban specialty foods, mojitos, pi√±a colada, Daiquiri, Old Clothes, Cuban-style rice (original), national Spanish food, Andalusian fried food, gourmet croquettes, variety üëâ menu of the day homemade meals, Madrid stews, Basque meals, etc, great terrace, good Latin music üé∂ and open from 7 am to 11 pm. DON'T YOU MISS IT! DOUBLE RODS AT 2.80 AND VARIED TAPEO,"
ChIJIwOPjywvQg0Re4c0RX-ejJQ,1,"The waitress took 8 minutes per clock to bring a coke and no appetizer. I had to ask him. ""Tremendous inattention"" and there was practically no one."
ChIJARuFbSgpQg0Rtw9CoYrf3KI,5,Pizza brutal
ChIJARuFbSgpQg0Rtw9CoYrf3KI,5,"It's the second time we've gone to this place and, honestly, we like everything we try more.
The pizzas are full of cheese and their dough feels delicious (plus, they allowed us to make half of each type); The empanadas are tasty and the chimichurri sauce they have to accompany them is delicious; There is little to say about the Milanese, the jewel in the crown, an outrageous and brutal dish, very delicious, very filling and very well cooked.
The only drawback we have is that, if you don't go to the terrace in good weather, the place is small and you can feel the smoke from the kitchen a little.
In any case, we will return millions of times because the quality-price ratio, I dare say, is one of the best in Madrid, in addition to reminding my partner of their Argentine food.
Thank you very much for the food and the treatment"
ChIJARuFbSgpQg0Rtw9CoYrf3KI,4,"February 2025

Starting with the best, the pizza is very good and very generous in the filling, not like those others that put the dough and a touch of the filling on top
Very abundant salad
The service was a bit slow and the place was very cold every time they opened the door."
ChIJARuFbSgpQg0Rtw9CoYrf3KI,3,"I ordered delivery and the food arrived on time.
Very good Neapolitan Milanese, abundant and with potatoes.
I ordered some very good chicken fingers although the mustard sauce is not one of my favorites, they should give you a choice.
The empanada arrived very soft and somewhat colder.
Generally very good!"
ChIJARuFbSgpQg0Rtw9CoYrf3KI,5,"I have eaten four times and everything is always good. Exquisite attention from the waiters, the work of the kitchen and the food they serve :-), perfect value for money.

I leave some images so you can see the pizzas and the Milanese.
The spinach empanada, the cheese/bacon Milanese and any pizza are recommended.
I have never gotten to the desserts, I'm sorry I can't comment on anything.

And the beer is always cold!!!
It is one of the places, which I repeat without hesitation.

Thank you Sanpas Rodriguez!!!"
ChIJjQ6ecCgpQg0RhDuzWqpPIrg,5,"Nothing but good things to say about this place  1. It's easily the best pasta I've had in Madrid! (Penne funghi). It was so creamy without being too heavy, so so so good.
2. We started with burrata, also great! It came out at the perfect temperature with fresh pita-like bread. We split a pizza, more roman style, so it's light and fresh. I recommend their spicy oil to put on top of the pie.
3. The service was amazing as well. We had drinks while we waited for a table, the servers were attentive to us the entire time, and we felt extremely welcomed."
ChIJjQ6ecCgpQg0RhDuzWqpPIrg,5,"I visited here for lunch towards end of May 2024, and loved everything about the spot, the quality of food (I had the bruschetta and veg pizza) and aperol spritz and the tiramisu which was yummy. I really liked the ambience of the space, including the choice of Italian music which was playing in the background. In addition, Kelvin who waited on me was very kind, polite and accommodating. The service was very quick too. Highly recommend!!"
ChIJjQ6ecCgpQg0RhDuzWqpPIrg,5,"The most delicious pizza, especially the dough. Amazing. The best in Madrid!!! Better than the dough in the first ranked ""out of Italy pizza in Madrid"" place... Love it!!!"
ChIJjQ6ecCgpQg0RhDuzWqpPIrg,5,"One of the best Italian restaurants in Madrid.
Salvatore is very tasty!"
ChIJjQ6ecCgpQg0RhDuzWqpPIrg,5,"We been here twice during a short trip to Madrid. Place is very nice and cosi, and food is delicious! Would recommend for anyone who wants quality food in a quite place!"
ChIJ814oqyovQg0R1ChTY4Z6EYU,5,"Great place, the nicest hosts, always feeling welcome and ending up making new friends or entering in interesting conversations with other visitors. Very recommendable!!"
ChIJ814oqyovQg0R1ChTY4Z6EYU,5,Nice people. Highly recommended. Multicultural ambience. Perfect place to chill and meet superb folks.
ChIJ814oqyovQg0R1ChTY4Z6EYU,5,"Very cool, eclectic little bar. Music, recitals, culture."
ChIJ814oqyovQg0R1ChTY4Z6EYU,5,Great night with friends
ChIJ814oqyovQg0R1ChTY4Z6EYU,5,"It was full and they made a little space for us outside. We ordered some Milanese sandwiches that were VERY good, but the cachopo croquettes‚Ä¶ another level. I had never tried them and they were spectacular.
6 drinks, 3 sandwiches, 1 capresse salad and 2 half portions cost us ‚Ç¨18pp.

We will return, the food is great!"
ChIJS4QHeyovQg0R0rUzxdv5D1E,4,"We received a great service from Noelia. She was spot on with all her recommendations. The slow cooked meat stew was my favorite but the merluza and the alcachofas were delicious too! Not too many options on desert but what we tried was ok, the Banoffee."
ChIJS4QHeyovQg0R0rUzxdv5D1E,4,"Very yummy and the service was great. HOWEVER, they brought both appetizer and bread - without having ordered them - and they charged us for it."
ChIJS4QHeyovQg0R0rUzxdv5D1E,3,"Overall I was disappointed although it got off to a good start.
The waiters were very friendly and efficient and the grilled artichokes, gazpacho and cheese slice (quesadilla) starters were very nice.
However, most of us were disappointed with the main dishes, namely the cod fillets (lomitos de bacalao) which were dry and tasteless and the rice dish (arroz a banda) which tasted very artificial.
Finally, the terrace is great, but don't go on a baking hot day when you will roast."
ChIJS4QHeyovQg0R0rUzxdv5D1E,5,Super high quality and tasty food ik a beautiful space. Oil lamps on your table! I highly recommend the octopus and tuna.
ChIJS4QHeyovQg0R0rUzxdv5D1E,3,"This used to be one of my favourite restaurant. However, they have recently changed their menu and it is no longer good value. For what you‚Äôre getting it‚Äôs far too expensive. The menu is also a mess and definitely needs rethinking. Despite all the prices going up by a lot the new menu is much cheaper looking as well which is just bizarre. Despite going all the time before we probably won‚Äôt visit again soon until they make some changes."
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RgsMh4jneQNE,1,"Today we have try again to have a nice meal at Lateral after some issues before... What a dissaster again... After receiving the carta we try to order some items... Sorry we don't have.. nope not today... Cachopito... Ah no sorry... But we have quesadillas.. well that looks good... Starter was ok.. however the it starts again.. quesadillas arrived... After 10 minutes still no food for my wife.. my food cold.. send it back and they bring both out however they didn't warm up the quesadillas again.. yuck... Anyway... You want a dessert... Yes please... Lemon pie... Yumie.. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, hello??? 15 minutes.. you know what... Check please.... Ow wait.. we didn't have the lemoncake...

What a no service  applying employees.... Well.. anyway . This was the last time... No more Lateral for us... And yes.. we came here normally almost once a week... But they totally messed everything up.... üëé"
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RgsMh4jneQNE,4,"Our waitress Noelia did an outstanding job, always pending and quickly. Sad that food came with some delay and needing additional heat specially the octopus. Also reversion using Google did not five location options so we were in the terrace that is nice for drink and have a snack but not for full meal specially having birds doing itself on ourselves. You know how to do better !!"
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RgsMh4jneQNE,5,"Lovely space, good food and a great vibe, felt like every table was full of friends catching up. Smiles abound and a very relaxed atmosphere.

The company we were with indicated the service was slower than usual but we didn‚Äôt see any issues. Simple menu with most of your favourites on there

Terrace is well warmed with heaters so night sitting is no issue."

A very pleasant place to have meaningful conversations while enjoying good music and well-chosen dishes from the menu.
Food: Portions are correct, with some room for improvement in flavor nuances, but the presentation is excellent, utilizing slate boards effectively.
Service: The team is well-coordinated, ensuring that no table is left with empty plates or bottles. The staff who attended to me were very professional.
Ambiance: As mentioned at the beginning, with a pleasant environment, good music, and attractive people, this place is definitely worth visiting.

Each restaurant deserves a second chance, and this visit marks mine after a long hiatus. The food, particularly the pintxos and snacks, is as good as ever. The atmosphere is welcoming, surrounded by beautiful people. The service, which was my previous concern, has improved. I hope this chain will continue to enhance its customer service.

Realmente decepcionante. Una de las camareras que nos atendi√≥ fue descort√©s y sin ning√∫n tipo de empat√≠a con el cliente. La comida regular m√°s bien mala y escasa y la tarta de chocolate es un horror."
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RgsMh4jneQNE,5,"Lovely atmosphere in the terrace.
We booked an hour in advance but arrived early and they made room for us without hassle.

Warm and cozy during a very cold day in Madrid, they served food really quickly.

We had montaditos with caramelized onion, goats cheese and beef, all made to perfection and served warm.

The truffled tortilla was out of this world as was the regular one. One minor point was that the tortillas were not as warm as they could have been.

Highly recommended."
ChIJk_LEyNUuQg0Rypc9oyAEqCU,5,I celebrated my 29th birthday here with 15 friends. They gave us the whole second floor (outdoors) to enjoy. Very amazing atmosphere (especially in spring/summer) and the food is fantastic! I personally love the mapo tofu & the duck dishes!
ChIJk_LEyNUuQg0Rypc9oyAEqCU,5,"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Madrid. We‚Äôve been eating here for several years now and always enjoy the wonderful authentic food and highly attentive service. The restaurant is very relaxing, with space between tables, and the terrace is one of Madrid‚Äôs best."
ChIJk_LEyNUuQg0Rypc9oyAEqCU,4,I loveed their food. Probably I had a higher expectation due to the price range. I recommend the red roll thing and mapa tofu. It is one of the renowned popular Chinese restaurant in town.
ChIJk_LEyNUuQg0Rypc9oyAEqCU,2,"Not so good place if to compare price vs food quality. Mainly the food was salty and not spicy interesting. Interior looks nice on the 1st floor, but the hall where people eat are not so great. They charged us for a small teapot 6 euros, only because we asked the 2nd cup. It‚Äôs ridiculous for one person the same amount of tea would cost only 3 euros"
ChIJk_LEyNUuQg0Rypc9oyAEqCU,5,Close to bus or Metro station. Authentic Chinese food!! Great service! Cosy atmosphere! Reasonable price! Got a free fruits plate at the end. 5 stars for sure!
ChIJgZ5PKCQvQg0RmBNjypJhb3w,5,Sirloin Steak was perfect for two people and great quality as well (they give you a hot plate to cook it to your liking). Then we ordered the cookie skillet with icecream for dessert and it was cooked to perfection!! Service was great too. 10/10 recommend if you‚Äôre looking to satisfy your American food cravings.
ChIJgZ5PKCQvQg0RmBNjypJhb3w,5,"Very enjoyable ambiance full of americana.
The steak was great.
The beer was plentiful.
The smash burger was juicy.

And Tommie was very insightful regarding our order."
ChIJgZ5PKCQvQg0RmBNjypJhb3w,5,"Excellent service! I absolutely loved the food, and the service was outstanding. A special thanks  to Ms. Rhea for being so accommodating with our requests during our dinner at Ribs."
ChIJgZ5PKCQvQg0RmBNjypJhb3w,5,"I have been in Madrid for 10 days and this is our 3rd time here. We tried entrecote, Caesar salad, chicken wings, onion rings and brownie for dessert. All of them were really delicious. The atmosphere is very nice and you feel very comfortable. Arturo took care of us. He was friendly and very fast in service. Thank you ü•∞"
ChIJgZ5PKCQvQg0RmBNjypJhb3w,4,"Takes for ever to get seated even though there are open tables. Food is good. Good decorations for American holidays, like Halloween."
ChIJTQMH8isvQg0RWFCeZfU7pwg,5,"Local, fairly priced fish monger. They have a good selection of fish with some seafood (anything particularl available on order). The team is super nice, makes you feel like family and have never failed with their good recommendations."
ChIJTQMH8isvQg0RWFCeZfU7pwg,5,"Top quality products!!!! At a very very good price, very attentive staff... thank you very much"

ChIJZ68x8SsvQg0Rh9G_h1obYIs,5,Great value. Especially fruits are wonderful.
ChIJZ68x8SsvQg0Rh9G_h1obYIs,1,"Some unpresentable people, they've been putting off cutting my ham for two weeks. Today I called and they told me that I would have to wait another two weeks when it was supposedly ready in the first... Telling me that they told me that after the holidays it was ready WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT THE SAME WEEK AT THE END I HAD IT. Thank you for not letting me enjoy my ham for the holidays even leaving it 3 weeks in advance. A hesitation in every rule."
ChIJZ68x8SsvQg0Rh9G_h1obYIs,4,"Wide variety of meats, cheeses and sausages. Very friendly staff."
ChIJZ68x8SsvQg0Rh9G_h1obYIs,5,Great butcher shop: both for the quality of its products and for the treatment provided by its employees and the price of the products.
ChIJZ68x8SsvQg0Rh9G_h1obYIs,5,Good quality products with somewhat high prices.
ChIJychAmS4vQg0R1BKFk-akl4Y,4,"Nice place, paella was to salty but the rest was fine. Fish was fresh."

ChIJychAmS4vQg0R1BKFk-akl4Y,4,A place close to our hotel. Friendly waiter and generally quite ok dinner.

ChIJXZM-9wsmQg0RXPfHnOtHngA,5,"Callao24 in Madrid is a culinary haven that seamlessly blends sophistication with the vibrant flavors of the Peruvian kitchen. From the moment I entered, the stylish decor and inviting ambiance set the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.

The attentive staff at Callao24 not only exuded professionalism but also showcased a deep understanding of the Peruvian-inspired menu. Their recommendations and insights added a personal touch to the evening, making it clear that this restaurant is committed to delivering an exceptional dining journey.

The Peruvian kitchen takes center stage, offering a diverse array of dishes that celebrate the rich culinary heritage of Peru. Each bite was a revelation of bold flavors and meticulous preparation. From ceviche bursting with freshness to perfectly seasoned anticuchos, the menu reflected the chef's mastery in capturing the essence of Peruvian cuisine.

What sets Callao24 apart is its commitment to quality ingredients and culinary artistry. The presentation of each dish was a visual delight, and the taste surpassed every expectation. The menu, thoughtfully curated with a focus on Peruvian gastronomy, provides a unique and delightful alternative to traditional dining options in Madrid.

In conclusion, Callao24 is a gastronomic marvel that not only pays homage to the Peruvian kitchen but also elevates the dining experience in Madrid. For those seeking a journey through the flavors of Peru in a sophisticated setting, this restaurant is an absolute gem. Highly recommended!"
ChIJXZM-9wsmQg0RXPfHnOtHngA,5,Amazing food. Lacks some music and ambience but everything els was amazing. Really good ceviche. A bit expensive for where  and what it is.
ChIJXZM-9wsmQg0RXPfHnOtHngA,3,"Lovely ambiance and very pleasant staff service.

The prices are on the high side so I was expecting a lot on the dishes' quality and portion will match it. Well, basis the ratings I've given here, it's pretty obvious. Decent but could be better. First time to try Peruvian food though."
ChIJXZM-9wsmQg0RXPfHnOtHngA,5,"This was my first experience eating Peruvian food and it was wonderful. My partner and I  tried the degustation menu at ‚Ç¨42 per person which was well worth the money! Each dish was beautiful in presentation and taste, the cocktail aperitif was a great starter and red wine that was recommended was beautiful as well. A highlight dish was the ceviche - it damn near transported me to another world it was that good! Couldn't recommend this restaurant more, and a big thanks to the wonderful staff who took such good care of us over our meal. We will be back!! :-)"
ChIJXZM-9wsmQg0RXPfHnOtHngA,5,"Fantastic restaurant with great food, more on the fancy side (vs classical), but innovative and delicious. the coctails are another thing you shouldn't miss out on."
ChIJZYa6FC8vQg0RgY56qsEtl6U,4,"We had to wait for a few hours at the Indonesian Embassy so we went here for lunch and had the Menu El Dia. I personally ordered the mixed salad, rice with squids nestea for the drink and flan for dessert. To be honest ‚Ç¨13,00 for all that IS A VERY GOOD PRICE in terms of quantity and quality of the food! The restaurant is very clean, the service is very good and friendly too."
ChIJZYa6FC8vQg0RgY56qsEtl6U,5,"We had an early lunch after we finished some business at the Indonesian embassy which is opposite this restaurant.

They served homemade warm food at reasonable prices (12‚Ç¨ for menu del d√≠a), the place was clean, the staff were friendly.
One of the good choices for lunch."
ChIJZYa6FC8vQg0RgY56qsEtl6U,4,"We had a quick breakfast of churros and coffee, hot chocolate with a cosy environment at a reasonable price and service."
ChIJZYa6FC8vQg0RgY56qsEtl6U,4,"The food is very nice. The service super fast.
The milk some and coffee sometimes not well.
Price is fine. But should do other menus."
ChIJZYa6FC8vQg0RgY56qsEtl6U,4,"Excellent place for lunch menu at very reasonable prices; good quality and variety of 3 course menu. Service is satisfactory. After several visits, consistency is assured. Cannot judge for dinner."
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RXxjp6HLm08c,5,"A great little cafe at the entrance to the Arturo Soria Mall, with a surprisingly extensive menu for such a small cafe/bar. Used to come here a lot in 2018/19 when I worked in Madrid. It‚Äôs still as good for a snack, main meal, gossip and catch up with friends."
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RXxjp6HLm08c,5,"A lovely little Caf√©, with great food at the entrance of Arturo Soria Plaza. Either you want to have breakfast, brunch; either coffee tea or something to drink, or menu del dia; it is a great option. The food is great. The tortilla de patata is truly delicious , especially the one with caramelized onion. In summary, although it is not in the center, this neighborhood is very beautiful, and Emyfa is a place you can come and sit and enjoy the green Arturo Soria any time of the day. The staff is helpful. Know that until 13 you have to order yourself, after that hour, the waiter comes to the table. There is no problem in parking, you can park in the plaza‚Ä¶"
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RXxjp6HLm08c,5,"The waitresses were amazing and so kind. I am from England but tried my best to speak Spanish with them. I was served by Yismina (or Yasmina), I forgot her name, I was also served by a young lady but I do not know her name.

Also, the food tasted great and was well worth it! 5 stars :)"
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RXxjp6HLm08c,4,"Great place to eat something, good quality price, I recommend the sandwiches, they are very tasty and the price is good."
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RXxjp6HLm08c,5,Ceci is lovely - so warm and friendly to everyone. I go in every morning for a takeaway coffee and she makes my mornings better.
ChIJoeN-YiYvQg0RfNXBrmcSGgk,5,"What an amazing place! The cheeses are awesome, you can choose from several options, with salads, and combine them with delicious wines. Also you can buy to take home.  We took the ""Viaje por Francia"", very tasty cheeses. Highly recommended!"
ChIJoeN-YiYvQg0RfNXBrmcSGgk,5,"If you are into cheese this is your place. The store looks like a living museum, but in this case you get to actually eat what‚Äôs exhibited. They have a great selection of European cheeses either goat, sheep or cow (French, Spanish, Italian...). Plus they have great wine that you can pair with the cheeses you get. They have a delicious Fig and Almond ‚Äúbread‚Äù (just those two ingredients) that you get to taste with the cheeses. We ordered the French and Spanish cheese boards and a half side of seafood croquettes (delicious by the way). That was more than enough for us two. The service was great. They are all experts of their products and will happily give you a list with the names of your favorites cheeses after tasting. Even though is pretty far away from the historic center of Madrid, it is worthwhile to visit and enjoy a great piece of cheese with a delicious glass of wine. The speak Spanish, French, and English, and have bilingual menus."
ChIJoeN-YiYvQg0RfNXBrmcSGgk,5,We always get to buy cheeses here for our fondue or raclette. One of the best in Madrid area.
ChIJoeN-YiYvQg0RfNXBrmcSGgk,5,"A wonderful little cheese shop where you will able to buy cheese and as well savour them on a platter. The cheeses are of excellent quality and the staff are patient in explaining you about the cheese and recommending the ones that meet your needs.

We bought a couple of cheese and a cheese tart from here and they were all excellent! Highly recommend this place!!"
ChIJoeN-YiYvQg0RfNXBrmcSGgk,5,The place is so pleasant. Cheese is delicious
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0RfB4YIWJlwKk,4,"A small mall in the heart of a such nice neighbourhood. It‚Äôs a so clean space and with good shops all over the place. The bakery is good, but expensive. There‚Äôs an open area at the back, a kind of back yard area which is cool in summertime to spend some relaxing time with friends."
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0RfB4YIWJlwKk,5,"Lovely small shopping with plenty to do and eat.
Fabulous art exhibition at play while we were there with truly great pieces to watch for a good hour or more if you had the time.
Big diversity of places to eat and fantastic atmosphere."

ChIJibgU5yUvQg0RfB4YIWJlwKk,5,"Nice small shopping center.  I stayed around this area in Madrid and here you can find breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.   Also a nice supermarket.  It had an outside sitting area in the second floor with restaurant options.  Also ATM machines and a bank."
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0RfB4YIWJlwKk,4,"Nice selection of restaurants, food looked good everywhere. Very little clothes for men, but for ladies there was plenty. Framing shop with some art for sale, bookstore, some accessories for women. Toilets were big, nice and clean."
ChIJU1L_3iUvQg0Rbt25o-lBhvE,5,"I had an amazing experience thanks to Roger! From the moment we arrived, he made us feel welcome with his friendly attitude and great recommendations.

ChIJU1L_3iUvQg0Rbt25o-lBhvE,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Casa Carmen in Plaza Arturo Soria not just once, but twice, and both visits exceeded my expectations in every way. This extraordinary establishment deserves every bit of its five-star rating. From the moment we stepped inside, we were enveloped in an ambiance of refined elegance, setting the stage for an unforgettable culinary journey.

Our dining experience began with a tantalizing array of starters, including the delectable pimientos de Padr√≥n, patatas bravas, and the refreshing ensalada c√©sar. Each dish was crafted with precision and showcased the chef's mastery of flavors. The pimientos de Padr√≥n was just the right amount of crunchy, the patatas bravas were perfectly crispy, and the ensalada c√©sar was a delightful medley of freshness and tanginess.

Moving on to the main course, we indulged in a symphony of taste sensations. The chicken tikka masala was a revelation, with tender chicken bathing in a rich, aromatic sauce that danced on our palates. The solomillo de ternera was a succulent masterpiece, cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The pechuga de pollo a la plancha con finas hierbas was a delightful surprise, tender and infused with the subtle herbs that elevated its taste. And the curry de verduras ligeramente picante con arroz jazm√≠n was a vegetarian delight, offering a perfect balance of spices and textures that left us craving more.

Throughout our dining experience, our waitress Luc√≠a demonstrated exceptional professionalism and warmth. She went above and beyond to make our evening memorable, ensuring that my mother, who didn't speak Spanish, felt comfortable and welcomed. Her attentiveness and genuine kindness were truly remarkable, adding an extra layer of delight to our already amazing experience.

The attention to detail and the seamless service provided by Luc√≠a further solidified our admiration for Casa Carmen.  The waitstaff's knowledge of the menu, their impeccable timing, and their genuine enthusiasm for culinary excellence were commendable.

Casa Carmen in Plaza Arturo Soria is a true gem that delivers a remarkable dining experience from start to finish. It's a haven for food enthusiasts seeking exceptional flavors, impeccable service, and an elegant atmosphere. Whether you're a local or a visitor to the area, I highly recommend treating yourself to the culinary delights of this fantastic restaurant. You won't be disappointed!

Thank you, Luc√≠a and Casa Carmen, for the two incredible dining experiences we had the pleasure of enjoying. We eagerly anticipate our next visit, eagerly anticipating the gastronomic delights that await us."
ChIJU1L_3iUvQg0Rbt25o-lBhvE,5,I‚Äôd like to thank Luis Alberto for making us feel welcome and guiding us through a wonderful dining experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and were very pleased with the overall atmosphere. I highly recommend visiting!
ChIJU1L_3iUvQg0Rbt25o-lBhvE,5,Excellent place to enjoy dinner. Great food and Alex service was even better service.
ChIJF34X3yUvQg0Rhu2jb1JwLHY,5,We had Cheese fondeau. Very nice.

ChIJ_1L_3iUvQg0RcdcV32kiCqA,4,"Very spacious, they have a terrace. Service was OK. Food is good, although we were shown a picture in order to chose the cooking of our meat, I chose pink in the middle and it was overcooked to medium well. The dessert was delicious."
ChIJ_1L_3iUvQg0RcdcV32kiCqA,5,The perfect place to enjoy a tasty burger. The cheesecake is divineü§åüèº I highly recommend this place!üëåüèº‚ú®

ChIJ_1L_3iUvQg0RcdcV32kiCqA,5,Excellent burgers in a fun setting. Their smash burger was really yummy
ChIJ_1L_3iUvQg0RcdcV32kiCqA,5,"The quality of the burgers is on par with the rest of the chain (we love Goiko Grill). They are usually very busy, there must be reason! We managed to book a table for lunch, which is a good idea because at lunch time there‚Äôs a daily menu that is cheaper than regular a la carte. In our case the waiter was great, shout out to Marcelo!"
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0R6l3dSxhQwZc,4,It was very nice to eat there. Excellent service and good food. It's a small place but there are tables outside and you can take out so it's fine. I personally prefer the fact that you can see the cooks making the sushi. recommendable.
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0R6l3dSxhQwZc,4,I had it rolled and prepared by order just before serving. It was delicious..I ate this portion myself ;)
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0R6l3dSxhQwZc,4,"A treat because the prices are pretty high. Expect to pay EUR25 for a larger box with edamame. The quality is good though and the sushi always tastes great. Don¬¥t expect special selections, but do expect fresh fish and nice service."
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0R6l3dSxhQwZc,5,"We love eating here so much, we do it on an almost weekly basis. Great food + service."
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0R6l3dSxhQwZc,5,i love it
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0RJlVTFND9i5s,5,"If you‚Äôre in Madrid and love Argentinian cuisine, The Knife in Arturo Soria is a hidden gem you need to visit. This restaurant perfectly captures the essence of Argentina's rich culinary traditions, offering a true taste of the country‚Äôs famous grill culture.

The ambiance is warm and welcoming, with rustic decor that instantly transports you to a traditional Argentinian parrilla. The buffet-style setup allows you to indulge in a wide variety of meats, all cooked to perfection. Whether it's the juicy cuts of beef, tender lamb, or flavorful sausages, the quality is consistently excellent. The asado, in particular, stands out with its smoky, charred flavors that are simply irresistible.

The selection doesn‚Äôt end with meat‚Äîthere are also delicious empanadas, with their flaky crusts and savory fillings, that make for the perfect starter. And if you have a sweet tooth, you‚Äôre in for a treat. The desserts, especially those featuring **dulce de leche**, are decadent and capture the essence of Argentinian sweetness.

The staff is friendly and attentive, adding to the overall positive experience. They ensure that your dining experience is smooth and enjoyable. Prices are reasonable, especially considering the quality and variety on offer, making it a great value.

In short, The Knife is a fantastic spot for anyone craving authentic Argentinian flavors in Madrid. Whether you‚Äôre a meat lover or simply looking to explore new culinary horizons, this restaurant will not disappoint."
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0RJlVTFND9i5s,5,"There is something to be said for a chain restaurant to be international. You‚Äôve got to do everything right - please all of the people all of the time. The Knife is no exception. When my husband took us here for lunch, I had no idea since I‚Äôm not a meat eater. But WOW. From start to finish, the experience and cuisine were amazing.
And for a charcoal grilled meat eatery to offer a smorgasbord of vegetarian and vegan dishes is delightful. The Knife does it with style and ambiance. They even offer sushi in the buffet, a big plus for my daughter. So at our table we had a one major meat eater, a picky 12-year old eater and a vegan. We could t have been happier.
Only tip to The Knife: since the buffet is your shining star, why is it hidden in the back? Major feature for first time meat eaters as it is a site to behold. A bit of confusion when entering: where is it? A hidden gem that needs to shine front row center. :-)"
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0RJlVTFND9i5s,4,"An Argentinian friend recommended it, It's our first time to try this place and our experience was overall good. Must come with a big appetite! They have so much meat to feed you...eat all you can! Service was good too. Will definitely go back!"
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0RJlVTFND9i5s,5,"This Argentinian steak house delivers a top-notch dining experience. The steaks are perfectly cooked, tender, and bursting with rich flavors. The rustic ambiance creates a cozy atmosphere, and the attentive staff ensure every detail is spot on. The tiramisu dessert is absolutely delicious, a perfect end to a fantastic meal. Highly recommended for steak enthusiasts!"
ChIJibgU5yUvQg0RJlVTFND9i5s,1,"I arrived at 10:20 PM, and the restaurant was supposed to close at 11:30 PM. As soon as I walked in, the hostess checked her watch and, instead of welcoming me, immediately informed me that they would be closing at 11:30. Completely unnecessary and rude! As if I wasn‚Äôt allowed to enjoy my meal within their official hours.
After this hostile reception, I sat down, and nobody came to serve me. I had to call someone myself because I was completely ignored. The attitude of the staff was disrespectful and unprofessional, making it clear that they didn‚Äôt want me there.
I finished eating at 10:50 PM, and not once was I offered dessert. Completely incompetent staff! They clearly just wanted me to leave as soon as possible.
I visited this place because a friend recommended it, but if I had known about this disgraceful service, I would have never stepped foot there. The environment is toxic, the staff is unwelcoming, and they treat customers as if they are a burden.
The only good thing is the meat, which is actually decent, but it‚Äôs absolutely not worth the terrible experience. I will never return, and I strongly advise everyone to stay away from this place! If you expect even basic respect, avoid this restaurant at all costs!"
ChIJ638oNiUvQg0R-vK-5rfOxwA,4,"Ummmmm, very nice, staff nice, helping me with my bad Spanish ü§£ pizza better than England, üëç"
ChIJ638oNiUvQg0R-vK-5rfOxwA,4,Good! Staff spoke English and I didn't have to wait long at all. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area and hungry!
ChIJ638oNiUvQg0R-vK-5rfOxwA,1,"I went to eat with 3 of friends on Friday, we are international students and we wanted to try the ""all you can eat"" option. The employee who was taking our order behaved in an extremely unprofessional way, I would even say racist to a certain extent. When we asked her if she speaks English she said yes.. We asked because it would be easier for us to order in English since our Spanish is horrible.. We started ordering and she was answering in Spanish, then we told her please english is easier for us.. she literally said ""you are here in Spain you have to speak Spanish"". She was very unpleasant and disrespectful in her interactions with us afterwards, I won't go through the description of her gestures. This wouldn't happen in any respectful restaurant. If you're not Spanish don't go to Domino's we don't need strangers or ""refugees"" from her looks although we are elite students in a prestigious business school - that's at least what I could understand from what she told us.. -"
ChIJ638oNiUvQg0R-vK-5rfOxwA,5,Gia amazing beautiful and sweet great service

ChIJD3S1EikvQg0R0tEZE7VG1uo,4,"The outdoor setup is very convenient for a hot Madrid evening and night
Food is just nothing special. A lot of fried stuff. Squid, croquettes... Omelette was to be improved.
Service is also average. So don't expect a delicious or special meal. But to eat something in a nice place it pays off."
ChIJD3S1EikvQg0R0tEZE7VG1uo,4,"No-frills, non-luxury place that serves very good food at reasonable prices. Staff is friendly if you are nice to them. Make the effort to ask their names and address them as people.
Food is prepared daily as well as the cheese tart. Try it. Flan is also a must."
ChIJD3S1EikvQg0R0tEZE7VG1uo,4,Very good food. Probably one of the best in the area.
ChIJD3S1EikvQg0R0tEZE7VG1uo,5,Great vaue for money if you don't go for 'menu'

I wanted to have spaghetti with Tomato and cheese and this was only available on the children‚Äôs menu .. I was not allowed it , I asked if they could make the kids meal into a larger portion , this was also not allowed. No manager was asked just a straight no .. in McDonalds and other establishments you are allowed to ask for a kids meal and no one questions it . I find VIPs in Arturo Soria is lacking  everthing that a good fast food place should have a"
ChIJg5mzkUKIZUARkZiyoF_irks,1,"The service was terrible.  I had the ""tomato"" on slices of toasted sourdough.  The tomato was a puree and only enough to spread in one toast. I asked for more ""tomato"" sauce and the waiter never bought it. It may have only cost ‚Ç¨2.75 but it was terrible to call that tomatoes when it was basically a pink sauce.
Terrible service and food.
I had an orange refresher drink and that was a sweet soda flavour drink, again horrible."
ChIJg5mzkUKIZUARkZiyoF_irks,3,"I really like this place. Usually food is also good but recently they introduced new bowl options. I have tried green power, pollo oriental and I did not like them AT ALL. I loved the Pollo Oriental Bowl they used to have beforeüòû. Please bring it back."
ChIJg5mzkUKIZUARkZiyoF_irks,1,"Probably the worst breakfast I have had in a Vips in 20 years  Food cooked from last night . Bland, coffee so weak   bacon soggy, almost raw  I left a lot on the plate. Not my usual habit. But today it was appropriate mushrooms"
ChIJg5mzkUKIZUARkZiyoF_irks,4,Typical VIPS. Friendly Service.
ChIJpSuC3dMoQg0RIK_8_J0I4NA,5,"One of the best seafood restaurants in Madrid.
They offer a large variety of seafood dishes from across the entire country.
I recommend the signature dish: fried prawn. It is really special.
They staff is very professional and offers a great service for the price I paid.
They even offered us a glass of liquor as a desert from the house.

The restaurant is mostly visited by locals and you certainly need a reservation if you want to have dinner or lunch there."
ChIJpSuC3dMoQg0RIK_8_J0I4NA,5,"We had dinner here and enjoyed a lot. The seafood are fresh and delicious. Staffs are professional and friendly - we can't speak in Spanish, but we can feel the staffs are passionate and helpful. Overall, the atmosphere is amazing. We wish to visit here again and again."
ChIJpSuC3dMoQg0RIK_8_J0I4NA,5,"The food and service were great! I‚Äôm glad the waiter understood my broken Spanish and got my order right. Everyone was so nice, and all the seafood was incredibly fresh. Loved it!"
ChIJpSuC3dMoQg0RIK_8_J0I4NA,5,"The best place in Madrid I‚Äôve been so far. Amazing food and good service. You must try shrimps, cheesecake and homemade wine (white). We will definitely come back many times üëçüèº thank you"
ChIJpSuC3dMoQg0RIK_8_J0I4NA,5,Doesn‚Äôt look all that fancy outside but the foods are really worth even a detour. They also make you feel at home.
ChIJn-jsEdMoQg0Raqmi31PE02c,5,Great place with truly authentic food and local ambience.. away from touristic crowd . Highly recommend!

ChIJn-jsEdMoQg0Raqmi31PE02c,5,"We went to give ourselves a small family tribute with a seafood barbecue. The atmosphere is familiar, the treatment is very attentive and correct and the barbecue is spectacular, finger-licking good. Highly recommended. We will return"
ChIJ__-bZiQvQg0RPOdU5wKG8as,5,Celebrated a birthday here with around 30 people. The space we were given was great and we were provided with our own bar and bar tender.  The live band added to a good atmosphere. I would highly recommend it for birthdays/work events etc.
ChIJ__-bZiQvQg0RPOdU5wKG8as,1,"We moved here 6 months ago and have been to this restaurant several times since and have had good food while listening to the fun live music. However, during the last (and final) visit my wife accidentally left her purse there. When we went back to pick it up nobody seemed to have seen it. This was particularly heartbreaking because it had some sentimental things from her aunt whom just passed away this week. Since my wife just got back from the states it also had her passport, cash, and credit cards. It was our fault for leaving it but also shocked, saddened, and frustrated that someone would take something like that! The owner was great and really helpful once we connected with him but unfortunately we just won‚Äôt be back knowing that there are dishonest thiefs lurking around there."
ChIJ__-bZiQvQg0RPOdU5wKG8as,5,"If you want special food, high quality, attractive environment and live music, be sure to visit here

ChIJ__-bZiQvQg0RPOdU5wKG8as,5,"Great food and live music (Rock&Roll, R&B, Blues, Jazz). Many thanks to our waiter Diego, excellent service. We will comeback for sure to this place.

Keep on the good service and music."
ChIJ__-bZiQvQg0RPOdU5wKG8as,5,"The steak was amazing. Very nice waiters too. Cool place, will definitely return if convenient."
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RDD8V8jaLlcE,1,Unfortunately this place changed it coffee machines for Nespresso machines. This lowered the quality of their coffee substantially. For a coffee from a capsule this place is expensive. At least the ambient is acceptable.
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RDD8V8jaLlcE,1,This cafe has the utmost worst service I have ever received. I have been waiting for a long time for a waitress to get back to me. I am still trying to order. I am hungry and angry.
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RDD8V8jaLlcE,4,My place of choice when it comes to get a birthday cake. You can also order bocaditos and snacks for a party. Good quality price ratio
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RDD8V8jaLlcE,2,The place is beautiful and the staff id friendly but there is a-lot to improve specially coffee & portions & food quality
ChIJn2fR5yUvQg0RDD8V8jaLlcE,4,Very good cakes and pastries but a little expensive
ChIJCyu9wdMoQg0RfOwxybF6Cf8,4,We visited Tres Mares restaurant in March 2022 with my family. The restaurant manager was very friendly and every waiter was happy! Food was fresh and we really enjoyed gambas and lubina. I highly recommend this restaurant to visit with your family!
ChIJCyu9wdMoQg0RfOwxybF6Cf8,3,Quite good food. Friendly and pleasant staff. A bit overpriced though.
ChIJCyu9wdMoQg0RfOwxybF6Cf8,4,"Excellent food, nice ambiance, terrific wine!

ChIJed2AGywvQg0RNC4xSkuIlYg,5,Lovely cafeteria tucked away in the northern section of Ciudad Lineal which I had to try for breakfast on my walk to work. Very Spanish. Very typical. Very good.
ChIJed2AGywvQg0RNC4xSkuIlYg,4,I didn't eat here. I went in to have a hot drink and use the restroom but I would definitely come back. The service was great and the place was immaculate. On top of it all it was the cheapest I've paid in the city. My only complaint was my cup had seen better days but other than that I would definitely return.
ChIJed2AGywvQg0RNC4xSkuIlYg,4,"Just go! Real food and real people...the locals will tell you.
Great food, great service, great price.
Couldn't be more simple than that."
ChIJed2AGywvQg0RNC4xSkuIlYg,4,Good staff but a little bit expensive.

ChIJUUyQXy4vQg0RuSkQrywjiVA,4,"Great food, for the lunch it is super affordable - 14euros for the starter-main-desert. Food was coming in super fast and with great portion. The staff was kinda rude, almost throwing the plates."
ChIJUUyQXy4vQg0RuSkQrywjiVA,4,"Good food and cheap
14euros for a lunch menu"
ChIJUUyQXy4vQg0RuSkQrywjiVA,3,"We had a breakfast here some weeks ago and honestly, it would be better if we went to another place.

I liked that there was a big range of meals, could choose whatever we wanted. And the staff was pretty nice as well. These are the advantages!

But the food was awful :( Spanish omelette was cold like it was served from a fridge. Sausages were so oily that I had a stomachache later, same happened to my friend actually, she had a breakfast with eggs and bacon. It wasn‚Äôt the worst though, that‚Äôs why there is 3 stars and not 1.

So maybe they have good lunches but the breakfast was bad.

Besides, the staff doesn‚Äôt know English, only my little Spanish helped."
ChIJUUyQXy4vQg0RuSkQrywjiVA,4,"The food was nice, but in my opinion the meal was overpriced compared to other restaurants, which offer a much nicer and more cozy atmosphere for the same price."
ChIJUUyQXy4vQg0RuSkQrywjiVA,4,"Cuco¬¥s is decent value for the ""menu del dia"" at lunch which always has a healthy option. Don¬¥t expect a lot of quantity though, if you order fish you¬¥ll typically get half of one. Service is decent. Good for a quick coffee or after work drink. In good weather, the terrace is nice!"
ChIJq3qAEdMoQg0RcIlw3qCDs9A,5,"I really liked the food here. Fairly priced and well prepared.
We tried clams and shrimps for starters. Both were fresh and tasty. A tomato salad with onions and tuna fish followed. Tomatoes were delicious even though they were not in season.
The last dish was a thick cut of steak, the fat content was good, well cooked, and evenly seasoned. Better than some of the well-known places in Madrid. Recommended."
ChIJq3qAEdMoQg0RcIlw3qCDs9A,5,"This place has by far the best steak I have ever had. I was in town with my family and we went 4 times. The seafood was amazing as well, highly recommend the coquinas. Service was flawless every time."
ChIJq3qAEdMoQg0RcIlw3qCDs9A,5,Amazing meat. Excellent place!
ChIJq3qAEdMoQg0RcIlw3qCDs9A,5,"Small place, bright light, excellent quality food.  Best gambas and mejillones i had in a long time"

ChIJy8FJCZ6HQQ0Rd5l5mE-7MqA,5,"Very good service, good quality food and a good place to have a drink after playing sports or walking. 100% recommended"
ChIJy8FJCZ6HQQ0Rd5l5mE-7MqA,5,"Buen hambiente con una terraza estupenda, nos atendi√≥ dos camareros s√∫per majos , una chica ni√±a muy simp√°tica y dalwin muy dulce. La comida buen√≠sima. Lo recomiendo 100%. Volveremos."
ChIJy8FJCZ6HQQ0Rd5l5mE-7MqA,1,"We have always ordered a loin sandwich every year in the summer and it was good but today, June 19, we ordered the same thing in the morning and they brought us old bread from days ago that had only been grilled for a moment and you can't eat it. It's disgusting and after complaining about it, the waitress also tells me that the bread isn't the same as last year or as last weekend and it's that hard because it's toasted.

The waitress and the waiters behind the bar were very annoying.
Arriving here you might say hello and I'm going to wait for my companions and the waiters behind the bar respond so why say hello if you're not going to order anything now!
It's the worst place you can go.
In my life I have been treated as poorly as today here!
They also charge what they want, one charge one way and another charge another. I'm not going to say that they are all who work there like this but some are very bad at customer service.
They don't even have complaint forms!"
ChIJy8FJCZ6HQQ0Rd5l5mE-7MqA,4,"Well, we have been very good. Menus at ‚Ç¨13. There are mixed plates and burgers. No reservation problems and easy parking. Good."
ChIJy8FJCZ6HQQ0Rd5l5mE-7MqA,1,"When you order a hamburger you assume that the potatoes are at least frozen ones from the bag, but no, they are straw potatoes from Mercadona, I hope they change the potatoes. Oh and they don't give ketchup"

Outside dinner

Took too long even though we had a reservation for 2 huge tables"
ChIJ_69JJSuHQQ0R-in2PsgoM8o,5,Absolutely incredible restaurant. You can watch/participate at the races while you eat and the food is amazing. Our waiter was N√©stor and he was extremely accommodating with our requests and even helped us with our picks for the races. For a great price we had the ‚ÄúDisfrutar‚Äù menu which includes 3 dishes plus a frozen margarita. 100% recommended.
ChIJ_69JJSuHQQ0R-in2PsgoM8o,2,"Nothing to do with the expectations or prestige of the chef.

We tried the enjoy menu which costs 55 euros per person and does not include drinks. We purchased the menu through Fever, as it included a frozen margarita.

To start, they brought us an appetizer that we didn't like. The wine glasses were not served to us at the table, but were already served.

First we tried the foie terrine, which was acceptable, accompanied by mango jam. The artichokes were delicious and accompanied by sage leaves and a pesto.

The main dishes were cannelloni, whose flavor seemed bland and cold, and the pork rib, which did not stand out in quality. It was even difficult to remove the bone from the meat.

The desserts were not to our taste. The lemon pie had a tartlet with a dry cotton candy and the creme brulee didn't have much flavor.

The frozen margarita was more like a canned drink than a freshly made margarita.

The location is prime, you can watch the races and enjoy the atmosphere of the racecourse, but the dinner doesn't justify the price. The service was also slow and the staff seemed inexperienced."
ChIJ_69JJSuHQQ0R-in2PsgoM8o,5,"A special evening to share as a couple or family. Great atmosphere during the races. Careful menu and very attentive service. We enjoyed the tranquility and good vibes there. There are many environments, depending on preferences: from the most romantic as a couple to the most family or with friends. We will return for the third time."
ChIJ_69JJSuHQQ0R-in2PsgoM8o,1,"Good raw materials but excessively small portions.
I don't see the Michelin star anywhere.
The first tuna tartare is shameful, there would be about 20 chunks of tuna.
Prawn carpacio Good and it was delicious but the toasted brioche bread was toasted days ago.
Good cannelloni, but those from any bar.
Of post; cheesecake well, creme brule is a flavorless cornstarch paste.

The views, the atmosphere are magical and the service wonderful."
ChIJJVXhvXSHQQ0R7fQTYdwOu_k,4,"If what you want is to have nice food while watching races, this is great. Overall price is ok. Recommended croquetas, bravas, sardines. I recommend few starters to share and then some main meat to share. Costilla de vaca was delicious and lomo to share was super tasty. A bit of improvement needed in the service as our table previously booked was not on their notes and also took them very long to serve us. Lucliky we finally got a lovely girl who gave an amazing service to us. Overall experience was very good and we will be back.
PS: Cheesecake is a must!!"
ChIJJVXhvXSHQQ0R7fQTYdwOu_k,1,"Today (dia de la hispanidad) we went for lunch, 4 adults and a 4-year old. The restaurant is perfectly located by the racetrack. As we walked in, looking at the meat and fish cooking on the grill was mouthwatering.

We ordered sardines, ensaladilla rusa, enslada de atun y tomates, the costillas de vacuna and hamburguesa de buey for the child - we said bring all the food at the same time, but bring the child's food first.

The waitstaff had no idea if there was juice on the drinks menu for the child. and also didn't know if there was a children's menu. Given that there were at least 20 children in the restaurant, that seemed like a bad sign

Our food came it wasn't anything special, reasonable fare from the parilla. Everything arrived except the hamburger for the child - we complained 3 times and once to someone who claimed to be the manager. After all the food was eaten and the child picked off our plates. Still no hamburger 30 minutes after we had all finished eating. The table next to us with 4 children had also ordered hamburgers at 2pm. It was now 4pm and we could see hamburgers being sent to other tables, but none to ours.

Finally they brought the hamburger for the child and the burgers for the other table. There was no apologies, served like there was just no problem.  After we paid the child was offered a complementary ice cream.

A decent restaurant would have comp'ed the burger and probably other dishes. How can customer service be so completely terrible. If I ever go to the races, there are plenty of great restaurants in Pozuelo, Aravaca and Moncloa, so there would be no need to suffer the appalling customer service we received at La Cantina."
ChIJJVXhvXSHQQ0R7fQTYdwOu_k,5,Went here with my family from the USA and had a fabulous time. Definitely recommend the torreznos and calamari with alioli

ChIJLd9NOrgpQg0Rnt3MGHG0EM8,4,Good food.... generous portions and friendly staff.
ChIJLd9NOrgpQg0Rnt3MGHG0EM8,3,Basic Chinese food. The staff were nice although hardly spoke any English.
ChIJI3gO2MUpQg0RDpTRR5H69PA,4,Delicious cheese cake. Artichokes weren‚Äôt the nicest but the lamb tacos were indeed tasty. The setting is beautiful - it‚Äôs a really lovely terrace. Best of all was the service - Roberto and the team were GREAT!
ChIJI3gO2MUpQg0RDpTRR5H69PA,4,Nice and cosy place with good variety of dishes at reasonable prices. We asked for tap water and we were charged for bottled water but the service was ok in general. The quality of food was decent.
ChIJI3gO2MUpQg0RDpTRR5H69PA,3,Everything great but food has downgraded lately. Hit and miss with flavor on dishes.
ChIJI3gO2MUpQg0RDpTRR5H69PA,4,"This is a nice, elegant but relaxed place. The food was good. We had the artichokes, the velvet crab tortilla served in the shell (very unusual) and the octopus. All were very good. The smoked cheese cake was excellent.  It is pricier than other options in the area but not overpriced when compared to similar quality restaurants. Service was attentive. We will definitely go back when the weather is better to sit out on the lovely terrace."
ChIJI3gO2MUpQg0RDpTRR5H69PA,1,"This place is a bit disappointing to me. I have been there a half dozen times probably. And every time the service was bad. The place is nicely decorated and probably the fanciest restaurant in the area. However, it is a bit pretencious and they seem to look down on people who don't fit the mould of the regular people who go there.

As for food, it is presented in a nice way and I'm pretty sure that the ingredients are good. However, it is nothing out of the ordinary. Sometimes it is not even tasty and there is always an ingredient that overpowers more than the rest of the plate's ingredients.

I once ordered Carrilleras which I normally love and have tried in many many places homemade or at other fancy restaurants and I never went wrong with it. At this restaurant though, it was saturated with wine that was not properly evaporated.

On top of that I was pregnant and the menu didn't mention that it had wine that is that saturated and not well evaporated. The waiter tried to convince me that they have cooked it for 4 hours and that I shouldn't taste the wine!!

As for a service incident, I once went there on a weekday with my sister and a newborn with me in a cart. The moment we entered, noticed a lot of empty tables.

The waiter immediately said that the whole restaurant is booked and that the only tables left are the onces with high stools. Or the one table that they keep by the kitchen.
Anyone who goes with a baby cart would know that it is very uncomfortable to sit at a high stool while looking after a baby in a cart. We chose the table by the kitchen.

We intended on ordering food, once they heard that we wanted to order food, they said that the other tables were available if we wanted!!! They seem to judge people by appearances or whatever criteria they have.

Very disappointing!!"
ChIJ_c-ak8cpQg0R8nivYu2MqcU,3,"An honest place for food, nothing special. I was having a bad day so that might not have helped. The staff was very kind and helpful"
ChIJ_c-ak8cpQg0R8nivYu2MqcU,5,So friendly and very fast giving food.
ChIJ_c-ak8cpQg0R8nivYu2MqcU,5,Nice and too much food from the north of Spain gastronomy
ChIJ_c-ak8cpQg0R8nivYu2MqcU,5,"Passing here all my life and I had never eaten at this neighborhood restaurant. One of those old-fashioned ones. We ate with the family on Sunday. It was all the way up. I'm not surprised. They have a fantastic menu at very competitive prices. The
Food is excellent, of a lifetime. The service is very nice and fast. The only problem is the hustle and bustle, but in this type of place it is normal. Highly recommended. We will return."
ChIJ_c-ak8cpQg0R8nivYu2MqcU,5,"Simply, very good. Good food, with a flavor that makes you want to return."
ChIJudCVZAApQg0R0IklugPWGLA,2,"The burgers are delicious, but we live very very close to the establishment and we were very disappointed with their temperature: they were cold.
We were also very surprised that we marked the meat as ‚Äúvery well done‚Äù, and we did not receive it as we ordered.
The packaging is very cool, but the decoration, the quality of the burgers and the flavor are of no use if the burger arrives ice cold, living so close to the establishment."
ChIJudCVZAApQg0R0IklugPWGLA,5,"You will not find a better take away burger, both to pick up at the store and to take home from the typical platforms. I recommend you try their cheddar potatoes and their chicken tenderloins as a starter. For hamburgers, try the master bbq and the queen, which is their proposal for the Spanish hamburger championship. Don't forget to order their carrot cake for dessert.

The diavola doesn't sting at all, says my partner who doesn't tolerate spicy food.
The prosciuto e fungi were bad, just like that, the cooked ham was bad and the mushrooms didn't taste particularly good either.
We don't know if the pizzas are always like this or it's for this specific day, because we don't understand the rest of the reviews."
ChIJ8zq-a3YpQg0Rw3pGDfDt40A,5,"Good food, Good price and Good quantity

ChIJ8zq-a3YpQg0Rw3pGDfDt40A,5,"I really like their hamburgers, and their bacon sandwiches. They never disappoint, they prepare them very well. They are very well priced, I always call and then come pick it up. Their in-person and telephone service is perfect. Their space is designed to pick up and take food home. The food is very good to take away with cardboard bags and staples. I recommend them since they are by far the best in the neighborhood."

They recommended dishes to choose from and it was a success. We ordered the prawn gyozas, the house roll, another flamb√©ed salmon roll, and a tempura roll that we liked the most.
Good presentation in a wooden boat.
As a point to improve, the touch of spiciness, since for our taste it was a bit lacking, especially in the tempura roll that came with jalape√±o but the spicy touch was not noticeable and neither was the Japanese mayonnaise."

ChIJ3-7IGbkpQg0RRUvvOjh1cWI,4,High quality products. Nice dishes cooked on a very Spanish traditional way. Very good meat and fish dishes. Very tender beef sirloin.
ChIJ3-7IGbkpQg0RRUvvOjh1cWI,5,Best bar/restaurant of the area. Amazing quality of  food and drinks. A hidden gem.
ChIJ3-7IGbkpQg0RRUvvOjh1cWI,5,"Great food, fantastic fish and red meat, lovely staff"
ChIJ2aQMCK8pQg0R2QTf15bDQyM,5,"The food is great, the best place you can eat if you want to see the entire Lakes and Covadonga area!!!"
ChIJ2aQMCK8pQg0R2QTf15bDQyM,1,"The first and last time I came back here I ordered a tortilla skewer, which was a small price at 3.50 for me expensive with how small it was and worst of all inedible it seems to me that they don't even know what salt is bland like the eye of a lousy partridge, I left the skewer for the trash which is the only thing it was worth for.."
ChIJ2aQMCK8pQg0R2QTf15bDQyM,5,"very good service, many tapas and many laughs with friends"
ChIJ2aQMCK8pQg0R2QTf15bDQyM,5,"Incredible place, great food, of course it's worth the experience. We had a magnificent afternoon and both the treatment of the professionals and the food, a 10. Thank you very much, we will return soon."
ChIJ2aQMCK8pQg0R2QTf15bDQyM,1,"I went once with just my computer to have a drink for a while while I finished a couple of work and normal things. I returned 2 weeks later to do the same thing and everything was different and worse: as I arrived, there was no one but a customer in the back. I greet the waiter (a bald guy of about 38 years old) who was at the bar who neither looks at me nor answers me. I still decide to sit at a table just in front of the bar and I get to work, hoping that the waiter would come over at some point to take my order. Almost an hour goes by without him coming to tell me anything, but since I was focused on my work, I don't even worry until I feel like having something to drink and I ask for it. He leaves it on the bar, I get up and take it to the table. I'm there for another hour until I decide to leave. When I get up to pay at the bar, the waiter tells me with bad manners and rudeness that this is not how one behaves in a bar, that this is not an Internet cafe where I just sit down to work. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it had never happened to me in my life to see a waiter in charge of the bar being so rude, rude and bitter towards a customer who had been polite at all times and without giving any problem. I told him that nothing was wrong since I wouldn't come back. Overall, it's a shabby bar where I haven't missed anything."
ChIJ-VsJH7IpQg0RBxWwc3864ws,5,This is a busy place but the staff's service is great and accommodating. The food & bread are simple and delicious too.
ChIJ-VsJH7IpQg0RBxWwc3864ws,5,"Really good coffee and dishes, atmosphere like on American movie"

ChIJeQliza0pQg0R2fIx1CgAG_M,5,"The atmosphere is warm and inviting, perfect for a relaxing coffee break or a productive work session. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure every customer feels welcome. I've tried several items on the menu, and everything has been consistently impressive. The prices are reasonable and they have outdoor dining. Keep up the fantastic work, team! Specifically I want to mention Bella, Carolina & Fernanda for your exceptional hospitality. You guys truly make a difference in customer experience."
ChIJeQliza0pQg0R2fIx1CgAG_M,5,Good ambiance. A very nice place near the road.
ChIJeQliza0pQg0R2fIx1CgAG_M,5,"If you search the place in life, where all the magic happens or even if you search for a deep sense in life. Go there, buy a donut and all your questions will be answered!"
ChIJeQliza0pQg0R2fIx1CgAG_M,5,"‚úì SERVICE: Consistently excellent (Carol treats us like family each time we go! Such a sweet person!)
‚úì SPEED: All staff are quick to get each order filled, and always with a smile!
‚úì FOOD & DRINK: Great breakfast & brunch options, my go-to for coffee outside of home ;)
‚úì CLEANLINESS: Usually quite clean ... of course this depends on customers not being complete slobs, too - but a great effort is made to keep the location tidy. (Dishes with trays should be removed from tables and placed in the collection cubby by customers!)
‚úì PRICES: Totally reasonable and they have always had good meal deals each time we've gone!!

‚úì‚úì‚úì‚úì‚úì 110% recommend! We've been going here for the last 8 years every weekend and will absolutely continue to make brunch dates at Audrey apart of our weekend ritual! ‚úì‚úì‚úì‚úì‚úì"
ChIJeQliza0pQg0R2fIx1CgAG_M,1,"The guy in counter is rude,I buy galletas with my nephew but as a foreign here I don't speak much of spanish and I don't understand much so I was pointing to what I want then when he gave it to me he ask if I speak spanish I said sorry but no,I even said sorry for not speaking and understanding because I can only speak english,but to my surprise he told me that it was my fault for not understanding and speaking spanish,I think he is such a raccist.!"
ChIJW9oANKwpQg0RiqpmbEEPgzA,4,Nice place! They just did renovations so it's pretty clean. It closes at 12:00 am so keep that in mind! Overall great experience!
ChIJW9oANKwpQg0RiqpmbEEPgzA,4,"Great service, really effective and fast!"
ChIJW9oANKwpQg0RiqpmbEEPgzA,5,"Best pizza- try the gourmet line, you will love it"
ChIJW9oANKwpQg0RiqpmbEEPgzA,2,"Poor, poor pizza.....now I remember why I chamge to the competence....second chance failed....."
ChIJW9oANKwpQg0RiqpmbEEPgzA,1,"Super fast delivery and arrived hot.
But the disastrous presentation. The pizza was average, but very bad looking.
The potato wedges are also regular, and few.
I got sick a few days later"
ChIJd0iVwq0pQg0RJIQbEMtWp8k,5,"From the outside the bar/ restaurant looked very inviting. The inside had small tables that looked out big, rectangular windows that gave the atmosphere feel cosy. The tinto de verano was really good which they served with a free tapa of tortilla de patata. We ordered the bocadillo de calamares and it was really good it was also a very generous portion! We want to go back and try out more things from the menu."
ChIJd0iVwq0pQg0RJIQbEMtWp8k,5,Small but cool place to drink and good tapas and food!

ChIJJ57wZLEpQg0RUf7NusuyAqo,4,Modern bar best visited on a sunny day when you can sit outside and ponder the forest park at the back
ChIJJ57wZLEpQg0RUf7NusuyAqo,1,"The place was empty, but they didn't let us sit to have a coffee with the excuse there was reservations. Very rude people. Never again"
ChIJJ57wZLEpQg0RUf7NusuyAqo,4,Nice terrace to breath fresh air in the amazing park Dehesa de la Villa. Service is a little slow but it's good if you are expecting to take it easy.
ChIJJ57wZLEpQg0RUf7NusuyAqo,1,I received Aperol Spritz with Sprite instead of sparkling water...
ChIJJ57wZLEpQg0RUf7NusuyAqo,4,"A little bit pricey, but standard spanish kitchen"
ChIJZfPlCK0pQg0RlTBV05nu3oA,3,"Not a bad neighbourhood joint, the menu del d√≠a is OK. The best thing the staff, they are usually very friendly."
ChIJZfPlCK0pQg0RlTBV05nu3oA,4,Nice place to quick refresh by glass of beer.

ChIJ56xjwEIpQg0Ruz7QVWDeRT8,4,"'Only a less positive assessment: too much noise. Two televisions at the same time, one with news and the other with talk shows is excessive. The cozy place would be even more and more comfortable by eliminating the televisions and with relaxed and soft ambient music, without disturbing rhythms."
ChIJ56xjwEIpQg0Ruz7QVWDeRT8,5,"Everything is very delicious, the original dishes! We ordered a beef nugget and American chicken. The waitress's attention was brilliant. 100% recommended"
ChIJ56xjwEIpQg0Ruz7QVWDeRT8,5,"Beautiful apart from the food, good service and very good atmosphere, recommended 100/100"
ChIJ56xjwEIpQg0Ruz7QVWDeRT8,1,"I don't recommend it at all bad service. On the menu there are three starters and three seconds, I sit down to eat, I order some flamenco eggs that Flamenqu√≠n says, oh and that doesn't exist, it's flamenco style, but hey, they come with two eggs with soggy yolks, third-grade ham, peas, frozen and hard, and a really bad tomato. The worst of all is that when I finish the first dish so they can put the second one on it, it tells me that there are no more meatballs left, which is what I had ordered, which I had stopped for that reason. What I'm saying is that things can be reported in advance because there were two things I knew I wouldn't have sat down to eat on top of that seeing that it's a bitch for me they charge me for the first dish ‚Ç¨6.50 for two fried eggs, a real shame but a real shame pissed off whether I left or not the next one I won't go again and I'm not going to recommend it to anyone"
ChIJ56xjwEIpQg0Ruz7QVWDeRT8,5,A good place to be with your people! The treatment is always unbeatable by all employees. Very good food and very good atmosphere! Always recommended!!
ChIJF8ia1nopQg0RMdbDBau7V9c,5,"I was delighted with the treatment, service and the quality of the birthday cake I ordered with chocolate and red berries. Nowadays, surrounded by industrialized products, it is appreciated to meet people who dedicate their time, patience and love to preparing such delicious things. A delicious cake.
Furthermore, I was pressed for time, I wrote to him by email and what a speed and agility. Thank you so much. It also helped me add a new activity to my wish list. Take a cake course. I saw that you also have something ü•∞"
ChIJF8ia1nopQg0RMdbDBau7V9c,5,"The Violetas candy cake is delicious. I ordered it for my niece's birthday, who loves Violets, and it is one of the best cakes we have ever tried: not only is the flavor very successful, but also the texture and flavor of the filling and the cake are incredible. The macarons and meringues on top were also very good, we were very happy with the result"
ChIJF8ia1nopQg0RMdbDBau7V9c,5,Fabulous! I ordered a Red Velvet cake for delivery. It arrived with a wonderful presentation on Christmas Eve. My guests were amazed. And the quality couldn't be better. Without a doubt the best cake I have ever tasted. :)
ChIJF8ia1nopQg0RMdbDBau7V9c,5,"An incredible job, we ordered our wedding cake and it was pure fantasy, much more than we imagined. Not to mention the taste‚Ä¶ I have no words. And the love and dedication with which he works... unbeatable. Thank you once again. ABSOLUTE PERFECTION."
ChIJF8ia1nopQg0RMdbDBau7V9c,5,"I asked him for a breakfast box. The person I gave it to loved it, the truth is that it is very complete, and well prepared. Furthermore, it was delivered much earlier than expected and I appreciate that. I recommend it and I will repeat it next time."
ChIJv81hGgApQg0RkbrtFcgAQxE,4,
ChIJv81hGgApQg0RkbrtFcgAQxE,5,"Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt able to try the pizza here because when I arrived, the oven was still heating up. but I ate one of the most delicious tostadas of my life.

Separately, it is worth noting the very pleasant and friendly staff.

I will definitely come back here if I have the opportunity to try their pizza.

I recommend!"
ChIJv81hGgApQg0RkbrtFcgAQxE,1,"Probably the worst menu we have ever tried in our life, we didn't ask for the complaints book because we didn't have time. In the photos it even seems to be good but the paella was stale for several days, the Caesar salad without comments, the sour pizza with the York ham in poor condition and the schnitzel ridiculously scarce. For dessert, coffee flan, cheese flan, egg flan, the chef is an innovator of his own. We opted for fruit, thinking it was hard to go wrong with that. Well, surprise, the orange was bad too. The waitress with the curly hair never bothered to ask if there was a problem and when we told her about it she told us that 'the colors are up to your taste'"
ChIJv81hGgApQg0RkbrtFcgAQxE,5,"The pizzas are incredibly delicious. We fell in love with this place. Served warm, fresh from the oven. We also complemented it with a salad that was the perfect accompaniment.

We sat on the terrace and it was so comfortable, you didn't feel bothered by the outside noise.

Very good service!!

The next time we ordered and went to pick up and it was great too."
ChIJv81hGgApQg0RkbrtFcgAQxE,5,"The pizza is spectacular, the girls are very friendly.
The service is worth 10. It is worth coming back and trying all the pizzas. . Mine was delicious.
We must have more places like this.
Cheesecake with pistachio and cookie creamü§§ü§§ You have to try them. Luisa and Helen are very attentive to us.
Thank you so much!!!!"
ChIJr7E4KWEpQg0R8oy2CYdbF-w,5,"I haven't tried many empanadas in my life, but Latitude's empanadas de carne and pizzas with loads of mozzarella were AMAZING!
Coming from the Czech Republic, I was very happy to find they have a nice selection of beers which were perfectly cold and much needed in the hot summer Madrid.
Service and atmosphere were very pleasant and homey. I will definitely drop by on my next visit to Madrid - can't wait!"
ChIJr7E4KWEpQg0R8oy2CYdbF-w,5,"Best empanadas I ever had, even better than my grandma's. The pizzas were great too. Good selection of draft beers and great service."
ChIJr7E4KWEpQg0R8oy2CYdbF-w,5,Nice place overall! We had some great beers and fully cheesed pizzas. The service was also great. Totally recommended
ChIJr7E4KWEpQg0R8oy2CYdbF-w,5,"Superb beers especially the IPA, and nice service."
ChIJr7E4KWEpQg0R8oy2CYdbF-w,1,Bad experience. The owners are not keeping their word. Not recommended at all.
ChIJny7THropQg0RwueqX5r4_Mo,5,Reasonable price and delicious burgerüòÜüòÜ and the bartender was so nice to help me by speaking in English :)
ChIJny7THropQg0RwueqX5r4_Mo,5,The best calamari sandwiches...very good brava sauce...generous portions and good atmosphere.
ChIJny7THropQg0RwueqX5r4_Mo,3,A pint of beer for ‚Ç¨2.10 seems a little expensive to me for a neighborhood bar.
ChIJny7THropQg0RwueqX5r4_Mo,5,"This place is super cozy, Irina is charming, she makes you feel very good in her cafe, I love it"
ChIJny7THropQg0RwueqX5r4_Mo,5,The owner Irina is a super nice person!!
ChIJ9wtkNI0pQg0RD2a_EADU-K4,5,"I HAD A DELICIOUS KEBAB FOR ONLY ‚Ç¨4!! IT WAS FULL OF MEAT.
The place was not full and I got my order quickly.
I'm definitely returning soon!!!"
ChIJ9wtkNI0pQg0RD2a_EADU-K4,3,"I was looking for a quick lunch and was not in the mood to exert the most minimal amount of effort to do so, so I ordered from this place on justeat. The beef kebap was not bad and came toasted, still warm with a heavy amount of cream sauce. The samosas were certainly not restaurant quality but still tasted pretty good. The baklavah I ordered for dessert was pretty soggy and bland and had an odd fatty mouth feel, reminiscent of vegetable shortening. In summary I would consider ordering again maybe if I were drunk and I would stay away from the baklavah."
ChIJ9wtkNI0pQg0RD2a_EADU-K4,5,Beautiful place Good service and delicious food i love this food
ChIJ9wtkNI0pQg0RD2a_EADU-K4,1,Worst kebap I have ever eaten
ChIJ9wtkNI0pQg0RD2a_EADU-K4,5,"The food is super delicious at a price that is totally justified according to the quality of their products. The sauces are very delicious and so is the waiter's. The staff is very nice but if you are careless you will find yourself sodomized in their bathroom. Otherwise everything was very delicious, and the food too,"
ChIJAWQ-aAApQg0RkFHJAp71y3A,1,"I order 3 porsions got only two.
No phone number o complain. No nothingnot the place I will visit again."
ChIJAWQ-aAApQg0RkFHJAp71y3A,5,Congratulations for food and attendance
ChIJAWQ-aAApQg0RkFHJAp71y3A,1,"Very rude person with beard and glasses. Very bad customer service. We were surprised that there was already a montaditos in the neighborhood and the service is terrible. They are new, inexperienced and arrogant when you suggest or ask them for something.
Goat butter and they have no other option (which not all people eat normally). His usual excuse is I can't do anything about it.
The other day I asked to take away two breakfasts and they charge a ‚Ç¨1 supplement for each breakfast and on top of that they don't even give you a bag because they say they don't have any. They don't even have a takeaway container for coffee. And yet they charge you ‚Ç¨1 and with great arrogance they tell you what it is.

We also ordered a Coke and we asked for it without ice, they gave it to us with ice, we complained about it and they told us ‚Äúwell, take it away and that's it.‚Äù

For being new, the place, which is very well located and renovated, has terrible service. We will not return again and all the residents of the area have already been warned of the attitude of the workers."
ChIJAWQ-aAApQg0RkFHJAp71y3A,1,"I bought two soft drinks for ‚Ç¨4, I asked for them without ice because I had a bit of a cold without imagining that they would only fill half the glasses. Something like this had never happened to me in any montadito, better to change the format of the glass then and serve it in mini glasses and charge half. It's a shame."
ChIJAWQ-aAApQg0RkFHJAp71y3A,1,"Of course we ordered two Spanish-style coffees... Normal coffee. We have not ordered long coffee and then on top of making the mistake of putting too much coffee.. refuses to add a little milk.

This has never happened to me anywhere in the world.

I left a few days ago.. we ordered two coffees. It seemed like a lot of coffee to us... we asked the waiter for more milk and he said no))))) Come on, I've never been told that in any cafeteria in Spain. And I told him I can know why or what the philosophy is... he said don't let me and that's it.

It seems like very bad service to me."
ChIJ522iLropQg0Rgl3E0baRJfM,5,"We were recommended. Amazing place to have a drink, the food was very good and the value for money was too. We were very comfortable on the terrace and the surrounding atmosphere is very calm. The waiters very friendly. The potatoes with chimichurri and the empanadas surprised me."
ChIJ522iLropQg0Rgl3E0baRJfM,5,"Very good service and better food!! The freshly made homemade chimichurri has no description, you have to try it!!!  The bacon with spices is also very delicious. And it also has a very good price. It has its little terrace and is very quiet. 100% recommended!"
ChIJ522iLropQg0Rgl3E0baRJfM,1,"Like other reviews, terrible treatment by the owner or manager. The truth is that you have to be more polite with customers. And since I suppose that as usual you will say something about the education of others, I wish you a good day. But come on, less bullying with the clientele will be better for you, take it as something to improve. All the best."
ChIJ522iLropQg0Rgl3E0baRJfM,5,Carlos is a sweetheart. Beer and breakfast are cheap and plentiful. Be sure to try the chimichurri potatoes and the goat cheese and caramelized onion empanada.
ChIJ522iLropQg0Rgl3E0baRJfM,5,They have 1009 beer on tap which is very good
ChIJESvmCTIpQg0RSaxHqIcSVds,5,"The restaurant is very good, very new and very well decorated. The waiters are very friendly and attentive at all times and are always looking out for you. The food is very good and juicy, you can tell that it is homemade and that it is a good product."
ChIJESvmCTIpQg0RSaxHqIcSVds,5,Very delicious chicken fingers and VERY good price! Advisable
ChIJESvmCTIpQg0RSaxHqIcSVds,1,"The place is chic, but I don't recommend it for tourists.

I received a burger with uncooked meat inside

What appears as a menu in the pictures is not valid.

Bar not restaurant"
ChIJESvmCTIpQg0RSaxHqIcSVds,5,"This new venture in the neighborhood is great with a menu of the day with incredible value for money. I ate with my brother and we both ordered a fideu√° that was tremendous. And for the seconds, he had a chicken Milanese and I had a generous beef burger.

12 euros each with drink and bread included.

The best thing, really, is their friendliness. I wish you all the luck in the world, although you won't need it!"
ChIJESvmCTIpQg0RSaxHqIcSVds,5,Fui all√≠ a comer y tomar algo con unos amigos. Muy buena comida y atenci√≥n. Sin duda volveremos
ChIJ7UG2LwApQg0RevlLXohyZ_0,5,"The pizzas are delicious, thin dough and with many ingredients. During the week there is a menu that includes delicious homemade dessert. The charming owners. Be careful because you cannot pay by card!"
ChIJ7UG2LwApQg0RevlLXohyZ_0,4,Family business with lovely people. It was the first time we went and we were chatting with the owner as if we went there every week.
ChIJ7UG2LwApQg0RevlLXohyZ_0,5,Very nice place with very delicious pizzas at more than reasonable prices. During the week they have fantastic menus. Special mention to the homemade desserts and the Colombian lady who runs it who is heavenly. Highly advisable

ChIJ1RGdiKUpQg0RTs8BnBS1wYA,5,Incredible terrace
ChIJ1RGdiKUpQg0RTs8BnBS1wYA,1,"What a disappointment! I went with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãenjoying an afternoon on the terrace of this bar, accompanied by my dog ‚Äã‚Äãwho was sitting calmly in a corner without disturbing anyone. And what happened? They kindly kicked us out, as if it were a crime to bring a dog that wasn't causing any nuisance. The policy of not allowing pets on the terrace seems absurd and very unsympathetic to me. The staff's attitude was unfriendly and, honestly, left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't understand how a place can be so inflexible and unfriendly to dogs.
I hope they reconsider their policy, because this will only alienate clients who value more humane and flexible treatment."
ChIJ1RGdiKUpQg0RTs8BnBS1wYA,5,"It is a spectacular and simple place, with a very good neighborhood atmosphere and spectacular urban and mountain views!!
My friend Isam is a ‚Äúcrack‚Äù

ChIJsdy9XaUpQg0RQlpfOgxtP-w,5,"A hidden gem.  The typical neighborhood bar, a small family business where the couple and their son work.  Good homemade food.  Attentive and friendly service. It has a nice terrace.  Phenomenal quality-price ratio."
ChIJsdy9XaUpQg0RQlpfOgxtP-w,4,"üìå Good black coffee, the waiter who served at the bar seemed to know everyone and that creates a pleasant atmosphere üëçüèª"

ChIJeS40JawpQg0R0fwRKms-uqw,5,The restaurant was recently refurbished and looks brand new. The staff is friendly and the food is great.
ChIJeS40JawpQg0R0fwRKms-uqw,1,I‚Äôdint even get to eat here! The place is full of roach! I left without even order any food. It was disgusting.
ChIJeS40JawpQg0R0fwRKms-uqw,1,This place is not clean at all. Please don‚Äôt go here.
ChIJeS40JawpQg0R0fwRKms-uqw,4,Hong Kong phooey

ChIJN1m0bawpQg0Rg-4GtXdYof8,5,"Exceptional quality of fish and seafood, very fresh and well prepared. It is a place to eat delicious food at a good price. Friendly close attention. The place is a typical neighborhood eatery. It has a small terrace overlooking the street. Nothing fancy. But without a doubt what matters most, the food, the quality and the attention.

I want to return soon and without a doubt we will do it often!!

The tomato with bonito was incredible, the peeled tomato and tomato flavor!
The zamburi√±as were delicious, plus the detail that one fell to the ground and they served me another. The prawns mmmm delicious. The squid is very delicious, as is the mullet and grilled squid."
ChIJN1m0bawpQg0Rg-4GtXdYof8,3,"The food is good, but the menu is not displayed so neither is the price.
You come out with the smell of cooking, clothes and hair. They must not have a smoke outlet in good condition. It's a pain to smell like fried chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãall day."
ChIJN1m0bawpQg0Rg-4GtXdYof8,5,"For seafood lovers at competitive prices.

Torreznos

grilled shrimp
Bacaladitos

Cozy atmosphere. Small space but very friendly staff. More establishments with professionals are missed. Very good CPR. And we were lucky to park at the door. We will return."
ChIJN1m0bawpQg0Rg-4GtXdYof8,5,"As a child I went with my father, to a place of a lifetime, with the usual friendly and endearing treatment and with the quality that a father would give to his children. A traditional place with a quality above 10. An essential visit to one of the best aperitifs in Madrid!"
ChIJN1m0bawpQg0Rg-4GtXdYof8,5,"My experience, very good in all aspects, homemade food, impeccable and fast service, a marvel of all the delicious meals, with two menus at different prices, a 10."
ChIJEUQW7JcpQg0RsS3n--t-h9o,5,"Good burger and tasty meat. Small and cozy place.
When we arrived it was just open and they were at half gas.
If I go through the area I will repeat."
ChIJEUQW7JcpQg0RsS3n--t-h9o,4,"My food was quite good, there is a good contrast of flavors although particularly the burger I tried, which had raspberry jam, was excessively sweet, so much so that it covered up the flavor of the rest of the ingredients. The food in general was good, the service was good, although the waiter waited on us and never came back for the table, we had to pay at the cashier, and we were alone in the place, nothing, a small detail to improve. The place is also very small, on a busy day it seems difficult to get a table."
ChIJEUQW7JcpQg0RsS3n--t-h9o,5,"We loved the place! We couldn't take a photo before because it looked so good that we ate it üëÖüëÖ
Everything 10/10 we loved it, we will return for sure!"
ChIJEUQW7JcpQg0RsS3n--t-h9o,5,"Very secluded bar but with very good burgers in the Valdezarza neighborhood. We had a Detodito which is a dish in which there are wings (delicious), teque√±os, quite good and well filled with cheese, fingers breaded with quicos that give it a special flavor and crunch, and homemade and well-seasoned fries. The burgers are generous and very good in flavor. We had a Paradise, a New York (Smash) and Tatemada. Each one richer and stronger and with more fries. The brioche bread is also very good. There are Smash burgers and normal ones to choose from. You can see the photos. Small but quiet, clean place and good attention from the owners. I will repeat. 100% RECOMMENDED."
ChIJEUQW7JcpQg0RsS3n--t-h9o,3,"Not bad, delicious burgers. The potatoes are homemade.
The wings are good but they are not at all remarkable, I could make them just the same at home, I would not order them again.
In general it is fine, if you are close and want to eat, however it would not be a place where I would book or would really want to try, which today is what you expect with a hamburger restaurant. With this price (‚Ç¨18 per person) I have eaten much better in other places, but it is not bad. Plus it's terribly cold, there's no heating.
The service was very very good, the owner was very nice.
Out of 10 it would be a 7."
ChIJ12Bz3sIpQg0Rk0HMzDGOJlM,5,Very good Japanese food I like it a lot

ChIJQ6dFbxwpQg0RU4r4U05OsCs,4,"Affordable food on menu ..
Lazy servings...and unhappy staff"
ChIJQ6dFbxwpQg0RU4r4U05OsCs,1,"COCKROACHES IN THE LOCAL!!!
The name that attends, without speaking.
We ask him for food and he doesn't answer. He leaves the counter to grab potatoes from the freezer and after a while he jumps out and says what I'm going to give you. Very unfriendly. While you are eating he can't take his eyes off you apart from having dead cockroaches on the floor!!! They do not serve at the table despite being alone, and with nothing to do. Sorry yes, talking on the phone must be better than serving customers!
A place where we won't go anymore"
ChIJQ6dFbxwpQg0RU4r4U05OsCs,1,"A real shame, the site has not paid attention or paid attention to the instructions that we have told it, the small amount, not the following
On the plate came a skewer of meat and everything else on the bottom was a shameful salad.
The durum without anything just meat where that has been seen"
ChIJQ6dFbxwpQg0RU4r4U05OsCs,1,"I ordered a mixed kebah and they put pieces of roasted breast at the bottom, which was not meat from the rotating diamond, I don't know the name because we all know what the cut is like.
Ordering something and having it made with leftovers is something that is directly disgusting, the last time I order from this place again."
ChIJQ6dFbxwpQg0RU4r4U05OsCs,5,"A very well done chicken, it tastes good... The oil seems good, they are friendly and have a good price. They make special days, chicken with wire here no ehhhüòä Nur you are a great guy."
ChIJ7cmBCKwpQg0RKiPNMqBAY70,5,"A truly authentic experience. Great food at a low price, the waiter and owner were kind and enthusiastic, and the atmosphere was really friendly. Best place we've dined at in Madrid."
ChIJ7cmBCKwpQg0RKiPNMqBAY70,5,"Great food, local ambient.The owner wordless!!!!
Croquettes boletus 10/10
Bull tail with sauce 10/10
Lamb chops 10/10

Total experience, supreme!!!"
ChIJ7cmBCKwpQg0RKiPNMqBAY70,5,Honest home-made food and generous and beautiful people. Will be back soon!
ChIJ7cmBCKwpQg0RKiPNMqBAY70,5,"Delicious on an off-scale level ü§§. This restaurant is one of my favorites in Madrid and in the world. I have been more than 8 times and every time I have tried something new, I have always been surprised by the quality and flavor of their dishes.

It is difficult to describe the good recipe, combined with freshness and quality of raw materials that come together here and make all customers leave happy.

Mandatory recommendation to all my friends who visit Madrid üëçüèª

Octopus, Meats, Croquettes, Desserts, everything is good."
ChIJ7cmBCKwpQg0RKiPNMqBAY70,5,VERY GOOD and ECONOMIC homemade food!! the BEST CROQUETTES in Madrid! Spectacular close treatment. Highly RECOMMENDED!
ChIJN9q_9ropQg0RkLhTtX_t43c,5,It was awesome and delicious food...
ChIJN9q_9ropQg0RkLhTtX_t43c,4,"Fast food, convenient. Reasonable price"
ChIJN9q_9ropQg0RkLhTtX_t43c,1,Muynt msl
ChIJN9q_9ropQg0RkLhTtX_t43c,5,Nice food and valuable variety of food.
ChIJN9q_9ropQg0RkLhTtX_t43c,5,"I ordered a beef durum menu to take away and it was very good. Good size and flavor, it also comes with a little jar of sauce to add yourself to the potatoes to taste. Price 9 euros without vegetables"
ChIJR0NCj6UpQg0RNQk4gWf8pbs,5,"Family service and homemade food, it has an economical daily menu"
ChIJR0NCj6UpQg0RNQk4gWf8pbs,3,"The owner is very nice, but as an appetizer they don't have much variety of bagged potatoes and little else."
ChIJR0NCj6UpQg0RNQk4gWf8pbs,5,"Typical neighborhood bar where Pablo, the owner, will make you have a pleasant time while you taste his magnificent appetizers. During the week, homemade and cheap daily menu. You will not stay hungry."
ChIJR0NCj6UpQg0RNQk4gWf8pbs,5,"The horchata is very good on a very neat terrace in the middle of the street, it is very good."
ChIJR0NCj6UpQg0RNQk4gWf8pbs,5,A lovely lady serves you. I didn't eat but I had a delicious coffee. It is a place where you are comfortable. The name is well placed üòò
ChIJ6UEQ4bMpQg0RqXLjgAIl1SQ,5,"I found this place through Google Maps because I was working in the area that day and needed to grab something to eat. I approached, saw that the food looked very good and I decided to order a couple of dishes (I recommend the Meatballs. They are very good!)

But what was my bad luck that I just left my wallet in the other jacket and I realized it right there while they were preparing my tupperware.  Despite my stress, the good man who served trusted me and also gave me food. I didn't have to do it but thanks to that gesture it completely saved me from being able to eat that day.  Obviously, I returned the next day to pay what I owed and I took the opportunity to take it and try the Madrid stew they have (Very delicious too! It lasted us twice at home) Since I don't live in my town I haven't experienced that gesture of customer service so close Like a lifelong neighborhood resident! I will definitely return to try more dishes when I am near there again. Thanks for everything"
ChIJ6UEQ4bMpQg0RqXLjgAIl1SQ,5,"After several days trying different things on the menu, I can say that you can tell that the food is homemade, both in the prepared dishes (the meatballs in particular are very good) and the pizzas.
Regarding the chickens, they are also very delicious, there was already a need for a chicken grill in the neighborhood.
I leave some photos where you can see the food....
I'll be back!"
ChIJ6UEQ4bMpQg0RqXLjgAIl1SQ,5,"I visited the Saconia T√°per last week. Spectacular dishes, varied and very delicious food and great friendliness on the part of the employees. Highly recommended."
ChIJ6UEQ4bMpQg0RqXLjgAIl1SQ,5,"They make wonderful roast chickens and the pasta with vegetables is very delicious too, those are the two things I've tried"
ChIJ6UEQ4bMpQg0RqXLjgAIl1SQ,4,"In a takeaway place, they have empanadas that are very delicious, they also have prepared dishes that are tasty like lasagna. They treat you with kindness."
ChIJzU1LIlApQg0Rd-sZ0QLlAb0,5,"How refreshing to have amazing tasting vegan burgers in Madrid! I went to collect in the area of Plaza Castilla during lunchtime. They mainly do delivery but you can order to pick up too. The burgers are really good. Good portion size, the fries are amazing. Try the BBQ burger 100%!"
ChIJzU1LIlApQg0Rd-sZ0QLlAb0,5,These might be the best vegan burgers I have tasted in my life. I have tested three of them and they are really tasty and perfectly balanced in flavours and textures. It's really hard to find a really good vegan burger but this place does it. Their vegan mayonnaise with truffle is to die for. I totally recommend!
ChIJzU1LIlApQg0Rd-sZ0QLlAb0,5,"These burgers are insane, amazing taste and super plant-based meat inside!! I absolutely raccomend!"
ChIJzU1LIlApQg0Rd-sZ0QLlAb0,5,"Delicious burger, with a smile. Thanks!"
ChIJzU1LIlApQg0Rd-sZ0QLlAb0,5,"Everything is great.
Tiramis√∫ is fantastic."
ChIJCx5ZnAIpQg0RvvVHI_C01xE,4,Excellent!!
ChIJCx5ZnAIpQg0RvvVHI_C01xE,5,"Neighborhood bar with a fairly large terrace, friendly waiters, very good value for money, we ordered some delicious calamari as well as the croquettes, I highly recommend it, for each drink they give you a tapa which is good.
Without a doubt one of the bars to have a few beers in the neighborhood."
ChIJCx5ZnAIpQg0RvvVHI_C01xE,5,"I have been several times and the truth is that they are charming, they serve you with great education, kindness and closeness. They have a very nice terrace where you can sit and have your coffee/soda or whatever quietly. Really responsible and hard-working people. They deserve 5 stars, and if I could, I would give them more."
ChIJCx5ZnAIpQg0RvvVHI_C01xE,5,The owners are very professional and friendly. I have had breakfast there several times and everything was very good. I recommend it
ChIJCx5ZnAIpQg0RvvVHI_C01xE,5,"Excellent price quality.
We went to breakfast. The large coffee with milk and the very rich orange juice. The delicious and crunchy tomato toasts.
The service was very fast and friendly."
ChIJrQ4oM6kpQg0RRXPWnJKWD0g,3,"Small restaurant with good kitchen. Higher quality compared to its competitors.
I will back"
ChIJrQ4oM6kpQg0RRXPWnJKWD0g,5,"Excellent food, supreme quality...a recent discover"
ChIJrQ4oM6kpQg0RRXPWnJKWD0g,5,"Brutal, perfect, excellent meat, better environment. A must"
ChIJrQ4oM6kpQg0RRXPWnJKWD0g,1,Not great food
ChIJrQ4oM6kpQg0RRXPWnJKWD0g,5,"We ate extraordinarily well, the food was delicious and the meat was excellent. The treatment by the waiter Rub√©n has been unbeatable, very attentive at all times and he has even kindly clarified the traces of a product due to an allergy. 100% recommended."
ChIJNY4puHIpQg0RhFl7XBHH0DU,5,"Perfect pizza, short waiting time, english menu, unfortunately i needed to use translator to communicate with owner. Anyway, great food for great prize. One normal, 30cm pizza was like 12‚Ç¨"
ChIJNY4puHIpQg0RhFl7XBHH0DU,1,"They have some decent pizzas, and I was generally satisfied. Putting one star for this reason:

Ordered a pizza diavola which was literally inedible. It's meant to be spicy but even through the obscene amount of spicy sauce,I could taste very bad quality ingredients. It was sooo saucy and wack, I only manged to eat two slices and had to throw away the rest.

I couldn't sleep at night because of stomach cramps after eating barely two slices. I could go into more detail but you can imagine the rest. It was just BAD. I will never order from Pizzeria Carlos ever again, you're better off ordering pizza hut, papa john's or caesar's. This was close to the worst pizza I ever ate.

Who ever made it should be fired on the spot, I can not imagine someone making this and being satisfied with the result. Have they tried eating it themselves? Luckily I got my money back at least."
ChIJNY4puHIpQg0RhFl7XBHH0DU,5,Pizza is good. The delivery service was on time and friendly when they took the order. Definitely ordering pizza from them again. If you want a spicy taste ask for P√≠cara pizza.
ChIJNY4puHIpQg0RhFl7XBHH0DU,1,"Their pizzas are not bad although I like the ones they make at the vallehermoso location quite a bit more. Their service is awful, I programed a delivery with just eat and it arrived 45 minutes too early, so by the time our guests arrived it was cold. They blame the just eat app but this isn‚Äôt a problem with other restaurants so I would imagine it is a management issue‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a shame I cant order from a different location as this is the only carlos that ships to my address."
ChIJNY4puHIpQg0RhFl7XBHH0DU,5,"Great place, different pizzas and salads"
ChIJAyk-yQYpQg0R_Yt-S9Q-8Uo,5,"One of the best chinese restaurant i have ever been, the food is fantastic, i recommend you order the Chao la fan fried rice you should order 2 or more because 1 is not enough, i really like the pollo frito almendrado, i would definitely come back with my family, really enjoyed the foodüëçüòÅ."
ChIJAyk-yQYpQg0R_Yt-S9Q-8Uo,4,"Food was great, and very affordable. Large portion sizes for the price. We ordered four different entrees, two styles of rice, and steamed dumplings for around ‚Ç¨50. Lemon chicken was perfectly cooked with a light, crispy exterior. Beef dish was a bit mushy and salty, but otherwise we enjoyed everything."
ChIJAyk-yQYpQg0R_Yt-S9Q-8Uo,3,"We ordered from this restaurant from just eat. I found the menu prices to be very reasonable. The food arrived 10 minutes late, so not super prompt but certainly not a big deal. Overall I found the dishes to be of decent quality but lacking flavor. The eggplant with ground meat was lacking some soy sauce, chili and garlic, to be considered ‚Äúestilo chino‚Äù. The chicken with almonds had very few almonds but at least plenty of tender chicken. The beef in the beef with bamboo and mushrooms could have been higher quality. The 3 delights rice was missing some seasoning. The spring rolls were decent but too soggy, I would recommend packaging them in a different way so they maintain some level of crunch. The shrimp chips were a pleasant surprise as an extra in the order. I would order delivery from them again but I will be on the lookout for a chinese restaurant in the area that delivers and has more flavorful/authentic food that isn‚Äôt just bending over backwards to please spanish taste buds."
ChIJAyk-yQYpQg0R_Yt-S9Q-8Uo,3,"Good food, friendly service, zero atmosphere, all the staff were at a table chatting on the phone, I felt like I was getting in their way. I hate to see staff chilling in their restaurant, not sure why it's bugs me."
ChIJAyk-yQYpQg0R_Yt-S9Q-8Uo,4,Don't go for there lunch time (12:00-13:00)! You won't get the same quality of service and food like afterwards. also I don't recommend the menu. But the rest is amazingly cheap and super delicious! The portions are big and the service is friendly.
ChIJy2mRoakpQg0RdEglHq9j-MM,5,"Great service , amazing food , good prices , a place with identity and tradition"
ChIJy2mRoakpQg0RdEglHq9j-MM,4,A true local gem.
ChIJy2mRoakpQg0RdEglHq9j-MM,2,"Price!
We asked for a mix of seafood (not available on the menu) and they charged us almost 150 euros for a plate (king crab, barnacles, shrimps and gambas) to share between 3 people. The place is away from tourists areas and was filled with local people, I was not expecting this and I don't think the locals would pay this kind of price. The food was ok but we are very disappointed."
ChIJy2mRoakpQg0RdEglHq9j-MM,5,"A must to the ones who love seafood from Galicia.
Quality and price relation very high."
ChIJy2mRoakpQg0RdEglHq9j-MM,5,Very fresh and well cooked seafood. The service was fast and friendly as well. We had a wonderful lunch.
ChIJg7N8qwYpQg0RE7sYaQYF0Mk,5,"We ordered by Glovo, and really enjoyed it. The paella was tasty, and while it took an hour it.came hot and fresh and good. So was the Gazpacho, the flan and the fruit salad. We are very happy and will order again."
ChIJg7N8qwYpQg0RE7sYaQYF0Mk,5,"Ordered through Glovo and it was here in 45 min, quick and easy- delicious paella and gazpacho, I know some folks here said they had a bad experience but it all went smooth for us and food is well packed and full of flavor! Definitely recommended."
ChIJg7N8qwYpQg0RE7sYaQYF0Mk,5,"Fantastic restaurant, great portion sizes, very tasty and vegetarian friendly! 10/10"
ChIJg7N8qwYpQg0RE7sYaQYF0Mk,4,I enjoyed the dishes
ChIJg7N8qwYpQg0RE7sYaQYF0Mk,5,"Yesterday I ordered country paella for 4 pax. We are very fond of this food
It was very good, much better than in many other restaurants that claim to be paella specialists. Very good quality/price. Home service came punctual and friendly. Hot paella. Luis, who took note of the order, helped us with the order and was very kind.
100% recommended.
They already have 4 more permanent clients.
Thank you"
ChIJhdkkcKopQg0Rt8I8rMLOBpU,4,Cool.
ChIJhdkkcKopQg0Rt8I8rMLOBpU,5,"THEY HAVE CLOSED IT!!!!

They give some snacks that a gypsy wouldn't miss.
Economical and first class menus
Wifi.    FQAV9EXJXF6SZN
closed on mondays"
ChIJhdkkcKopQg0Rt8I8rMLOBpU,2,"The food is very good (the cook), the price is quite acceptable...but the service, especially the waiter, is terrible...you don't ask for water or the train, as well as the bread...etc..."
ChIJhdkkcKopQg0Rt8I8rMLOBpU,1,"A dry potato pancake... And a few depressing glasses of white wine with a splash of na. It is noticeable that no matter who new customers, the wine glasses of the usual ones were overflowing"
ChIJhdkkcKopQg0Rt8I8rMLOBpU,5,Very good menu. They should put someone else in the room. Very professional service
ChIJqdUTrqspQg0RuVhlTJgkd-U,4,"If you're in Barrio Tetuan in Madrid, definitely a go-to place for Kebab/Pizza if you want a yummy, quick dinner in a vibrant residential neighbourhood. This is a frequent place for me! I recommend the chicken kebab, but my favourite thing are their pizza's, they are so good! I usually go for Pizza Evin, which has the perfect mixture of veggies with chicken or meat or both! Even though I usually order to-go, they have indoor and outdoor (terrace) seating, the staff serve quickly, and it's children and pet friendly. However, it's usually noisy since the tables are on the pavement close to the street with the sound of music coming from the inside  speakers... If you go accompanied, it might be better to sit outside to at least hear yourselves speak... but at least it creates a good ambience! It's definitely a good choice! üëçüèª"
ChIJqdUTrqspQg0RuVhlTJgkd-U,4,"Nice place to have a break at night. Low prices, fest service and a good taste. It is suitable for company and even for small family dinner."
ChIJqdUTrqspQg0RuVhlTJgkd-U,5,"They put the sauces on the side without even being asked to do so, very thoughtful keeping my fries from getting soggy. Otherwise standard affordable kebabs, you know what you are getting."
ChIJqdUTrqspQg0RuVhlTJgkd-U,5,"Good pizza, had a durum d√∂ner kebab. Well balanced mixed but a potty he didn't ask for what sauce I wanted. I prefer my durum in a different way"
ChIJqdUTrqspQg0RuVhlTJgkd-U,5,"very nice food, I particularly love the pizza kebab. everyone is very nice there. it has a very cozy feel. it's really homely. I could give them the sixth üåü"
ChIJSTkCWwcpQg0ReGlVnCGkt88,5,"excellent sunshine and, homie crew. if u live near by this is the aperitivo place"
ChIJSTkCWwcpQg0ReGlVnCGkt88,5,Great local
ChIJSTkCWwcpQg0ReGlVnCGkt88,4,"Neighborhood bar without great fanfare.
Small place but excellent terrace. Good service, there is never a lack of an appetizer with the drink
They should be more aware of the cleanliness of the toilets and that there is no shortage of soap. They also have mojitos now, the mint one is magnificent."
ChIJSTkCWwcpQg0ReGlVnCGkt88,5,A very good bar. The owner is super friendly and helpful. Highly recommended.
ChIJSTkCWwcpQg0ReGlVnCGkt88,5,"Good terrace. The croquettes, the scrambled blood sausage, very delicious wings. Very good place to have tapas. Very friendly staff"
ChIJDYEsfgApQg0RskLSOVkV9IU,1,"The food reviews must be old, there was no octopus or other things, I must have left the moment I opened the door, a strange musty smell.
I went to this place because of the positive reviews, but there are few reviews so they will be from friends or regular customers."
ChIJDYEsfgApQg0RskLSOVkV9IU,5,"If you want to try the most exquisite Galician octopus this is the place!
And you can call and order it to go üëçüèª
And also try the donuts accompanied with Irish coffee.  üíØ Recommended!"
ChIJDYEsfgApQg0RskLSOVkV9IU,1,Don't go to breakfast. It's not his thing. Burnt toast. Sunflower oil in an EVOO bottle. Fatal.
ChIJDYEsfgApQg0RskLSOVkV9IU,5,"Good service, a nice person and the Galician-style octopus is very delicious. I recommend it."
ChIJDYEsfgApQg0RskLSOVkV9IU,5,"The food is a 10, especially the octopus. I will repeat for sure, the unbeatable treatment from Eduardo and √Ålexia"
ChIJXUGHvwApQg0R0zMaiXoUkaQ,5,"The lady in the country is super friendly. There's a lot of customers but she's still smiling doing her stuff. Also, a great place to meet up people."
ChIJXUGHvwApQg0R0zMaiXoUkaQ,4,"This place has very good collections of Sandwiches.. The quality of coffee is not that ""great"" but particular this branch has a beautiful atmosphere. Please enjoy the Sun in winter and enjoy your breakfast here üíñüíñüíñ"
ChIJXUGHvwApQg0R0zMaiXoUkaQ,4,"This great little cafe is well positioned on the main street in Tetuan.
Staff are friendly and menu offers a reasonable selection of quick and tasty sandwich and fucaccia products which are all reasonably priced."
ChIJXUGHvwApQg0R0zMaiXoUkaQ,4,Nice place to have a sandwich and coffee which was great
ChIJXUGHvwApQg0R0zMaiXoUkaQ,3,Not bad
ChIJS58RdgApQg0RZ44JgHX6Wig,4,"Very good coffee and nice baked goods, reasonably priced too."
ChIJS58RdgApQg0RZ44JgHX6Wig,1,"It‚Äôs the second time I go there and the waitresses are just plain rude. I tried to talk English with them and the reply was a really rude ‚Äúno te entiendo‚Äù so I continued the conversation in Spanish (which I‚Äôm not fluent but I speak it). As soon as you start to order they start doing other things so your order is bound to go wrong, which is what happened the last time. When I told her she got it wrong she rolled her eyes and insisted it was what I asked for, so eventually when she wanted to change it I just kept the wrong item.
It‚Äôs a shame because I actually like their Frappuccino and bread."
ChIJS58RdgApQg0RZ44JgHX6Wig,5,Very tasty and a great service. Take away and refreshing smoothies
ChIJS58RdgApQg0RZ44JgHX6Wig,4,"I like this place, coffees are nice, the service is fast, I love the empanadas, it‚Äôs very cozy and good quality for money"
ChIJS58RdgApQg0RZ44JgHX6Wig,5,Best cafe in Madrid - most friendly staff!
ChIJD_SmmwYpQg0RPKqE9DxtnlY,1,"This is the far most disgusting and dirty Burger King, the toilets are a mess, there is garbage everywhere on the floor and the entire location is full of smoke."
ChIJD_SmmwYpQg0RPKqE9DxtnlY,3,"The typical BK experience... Either you love it or leave it. The crew here are slow, though they are courteous and friendly. Bathrooms are clean. Food is good. the french fries were old but still edible."
ChIJD_SmmwYpQg0RPKqE9DxtnlY,5,"The crew named INDIRA, was nice and awesome! She look for my missing toy collection. Kudos! The place was relaxing and clean."
ChIJD_SmmwYpQg0RPKqE9DxtnlY,2,Staff are kind.. but some of the cleaners are so noisy when he is cleaning pushing or pulling the chair is making alot of noise is really paining the ear of customers while eating
ChIJD_SmmwYpQg0RPKqE9DxtnlY,5,"lovely stuff,  not so crowded, very reasonable price specialy with using the application discount and there are a variety of game options for kids"
ChIJQ1J94AYpQg0RXxsBkjLcHWo,5,"Amazing staff. A super nice lady from Bulgaria helped us a lot (we don‚Äôt speak a word of Spanish and she spoke Russian), she deserves a raise. The food was good and good prices. Nice and cozy, was not full."
ChIJQ1J94AYpQg0RXxsBkjLcHWo,5,"Simple Spanish Restaurant, normal atmosphere not a tourist trap, most of the people were Spanish when I was there, simple but very tasty food. More than reasonable prices."
ChIJQ1J94AYpQg0RXxsBkjLcHWo,4,Cheap local. Had a brilliant empanada on the way back home.
ChIJQ1J94AYpQg0RXxsBkjLcHWo,5,The perfect neighborhood bar and very welcoming to visitors. Excellent food. Attentive service. Thank you for a great visit.
ChIJQ1J94AYpQg0RXxsBkjLcHWo,3,Ok
ChIJwSiLzAYpQg0R3HYbbZZthF8,5,Delicious and authentic food
ChIJwSiLzAYpQg0R3HYbbZZthF8,5,Excellent food! Fantastic service! I recommend as the food is beyond this would with taste. Very affordable
ChIJwSiLzAYpQg0R3HYbbZZthF8,5,Excellent variety of delicious tapas with every drink!
ChIJwSiLzAYpQg0R3HYbbZZthF8,5,"Incredible food in quantity, price and quality."
ChIJwSiLzAYpQg0R3HYbbZZthF8,5,Very delicious food and friendly service.
ChIJ9QWedAgpQg0Rgtqefs1oeYQ,5,"Studied in Madrid 20 years ago and authentic Mexican food was severely lacking. El Tio Taco was absolutely fantastic and the food was richly and authentically flavored.

We started with nachos and guacamole that came with a perfect and smoky salsa then had rings tacos, ‚ÄúAztec‚Äù tortilla soup, veggie chilaquiles and beef burrito.

Everything super flavorful and perfectly spiced.

Place is informal and very relaxed but with worth seeking out if you are craving tasty Mexican."
ChIJ9QWedAgpQg0Rgtqefs1oeYQ,5,"As someone who grew up in a Mexican household, I‚Äôm always on the hunt for real, flavorful Mexican food in Madrid‚Äîand let‚Äôs be honest, most places miss the mark. But T√≠o Taco? Easily one of the best. The flavors are bold, the spice and heat in salsas actually exists (which is rare here!), and everything tastes homemade. The sopa azteca was comforting and packed with flavor, the fajitas were perfectly seasoned, the tacos are delicious and the margaritas? Just what you need to round it all out. If you‚Äôre craving real Mexican food in Madrid, this is the spot! Also, this place offers pozole, which I‚Äôve never seen on a Mexican restaurant menu here in Madrid!"
ChIJ9QWedAgpQg0Rgtqefs1oeYQ,5,"Incredible!!! Food was not only authentic but fresh had so much flavour. The service was fast and friendly. Good value for money.
Definitely recommend. Well done keep up the good work üëåüèº"
ChIJ9QWedAgpQg0Rgtqefs1oeYQ,5,"Wonderful restaurant with kind, Mexican owner with authentic food with Mexican music playing. I would recommend and would come here again."
ChIJ9QWedAgpQg0Rgtqefs1oeYQ,3,"You should go. Listen, bartender is cool, tacos decent but you aint in mexico (obvs), mezcal - go somewhere else. All in all decent place"
ChIJK2PT9gYpQg0Rr6-XNi0ikyI,4,"I had lunch menu once, the quantity is good. Very typical Spanish food at good price. There is a small terrace sometimes busy. The staff is professional and friendly. There could be some improvements: more staffing during rush hours to reduce the waiting time."
ChIJK2PT9gYpQg0Rr6-XNi0ikyI,3,"Everything was cheap, even the service and the location."
ChIJK2PT9gYpQg0Rr6-XNi0ikyI,5,Excellent staff and excellent food

ChIJn-DvKFUoQg0RBbNkCZLbfxw,5,"Great experience! We stayed in Bety Dreams apartments and we were invited breakfast in this restaurant.
We had dinner and it couldn't have been better, high quality home made food. T√≠pical Spanish dishes.  Delicious. Far the best in the area, near Santiago Bernabeu stadium."
ChIJn-DvKFUoQg0RBbNkCZLbfxw,5,"Very friendly, traditional bar and restaurant. Excellent service and good atmosphere. 100% recommended !"
ChIJn-DvKFUoQg0RBbNkCZLbfxw,5,"Good lunch menu with a large selection of dishes. Large terrace, but with a slight incline.
You might need a reservation for lunch on weekends."
ChIJn-DvKFUoQg0RBbNkCZLbfxw,5,I stayed in the Bety Dream and we had breakfast at the restaurant Mirador de Castilla and we were delighted.
ChIJn-DvKFUoQg0RBbNkCZLbfxw,5,Best Spanish food in the area. I visit this restaurant every time I go to Madrid.
ChIJK-lDqwEpQg0Rr0QywrpSbHU,4,Not a bad place. Been renovated and has a decent selection of produce shops. There's a Mercadona underneath.
ChIJK-lDqwEpQg0Rr0QywrpSbHU,5,Pretty good shop
ChIJK-lDqwEpQg0Rr0QywrpSbHU,5,A big variety of food
ChIJK-lDqwEpQg0Rr0QywrpSbHU,5,Good
ChIJK-lDqwEpQg0Rr0QywrpSbHU,5,"A market that is getting better and better! I have eaten Andean pastries, grilled chicken, smoked meats and everything is first class and the best is the service in each of the establishments!!! I will return"

ChIJj769Q6spQg0RHwbGyzj4g14,4,You will not expected this restaurant hidden among Tetuan streets. Perfect for family meeting. High quality national goods really well-cooked. The service is super kind and attentive. Do not miss their zamburi√±as and pulpo.
ChIJj769Q6spQg0RHwbGyzj4g14,5,"Food is excellent quality. The dados del campo and dados de mar are my favourite dishes. Although I have also had breakfast here on occasions lunch or dinner is better. Good value for money. Wine selection is also great and service is very attentive, discreet and fun! Highly recommended."
ChIJj769Q6spQg0RHwbGyzj4g14,5,very tasty food
ChIJj769Q6spQg0RHwbGyzj4g14,3,Ok
ChIJj769Q6spQg0RHwbGyzj4g14,4,Excellent
ChIJJUPBoKopQg0Ri6Wygdqmr-c,5,"Although the previous owner has been changed, now the food quality and servicing are getting better. Not like that, they are also trying to care for their customers to serve dynamic process through online and doortstep delivery system. As I heard from their manager they are making app for ordering food and offering latest discount. So I think it's a best deal for side way cafe."
ChIJJUPBoKopQg0Ri6Wygdqmr-c,5,"Everything is normal, but the food is excellent. If you like sitting in the sidewalk, drink, eat, and smoke this is a good spot."
ChIJJUPBoKopQg0Ri6Wygdqmr-c,5,I liked their mixed doner kebab so much
ChIJJUPBoKopQg0Ri6Wygdqmr-c,1,"Garbage scammer from Bangladesh.
Not real Turkish food.

Pizza is 0.2 mm thickness

ChIJJUPBoKopQg0Ri6Wygdqmr-c,5,It's very good and clean.and there service and behavior also very good.food was and testy
ChIJ2-pY36opQg0R2IBB-O2vOfk,4,"Delicious seafood restaurant in Tetuan. Traditional service and some good recommendations. The homemade empanada is perfect - they even had a lamprey eel one to try - and the lacon (ham) with potatoes and greens is a full dish of flavour. The only let down for me was the turbot fish which was much too small and honey a portion for the price. Otherwise, everything was good!"
ChIJ2-pY36opQg0R2IBB-O2vOfk,5,"Top notch service and amazing food. It was a little intimidating at first since I speak little Spanish. Even though the owner didn't speak much Spanish, we felt very comfortable, welcoming, and accommodated. It's definitely not a tourist place as it's tucked away in a very quiet neighborhood and the place was filled with mostly local patrons. They even offered us the ""special"" alcohol at the end of the meal.  Wasn't sure what that was but we enjoyed and drank quite a lot of it."
ChIJ2-pY36opQg0R2IBB-O2vOfk,5,"Be honest very nice place, and all like staff Senor Peppe, Albaro gave us nice gift üéÅüëåüèªüôèüèª
Thank you üôèüèª Gracias"
ChIJ2-pY36opQg0R2IBB-O2vOfk,5,"It was everything perfect.
Thank u Juanito :))"
ChIJ2-pY36opQg0R2IBB-O2vOfk,5,"A bit out of the way for tourists, but well worth the trip. The freshest seafood in a warm setting full of locals. Service is great and prices reasonable for the quality."
ChIJ89Mp86opQg0RZU7HRY1FjV4,4,"A classic Spanish tapas bar where ordering a drink comes with complimentary snacks. I ordered pulpo and calamares, and as I kept adding drinks, I got to try various tapas like torreznos and salchicha.

If you're looking for a tapas bar near Estrecho station, this place is worth a visit."
ChIJ89Mp86opQg0RZU7HRY1FjV4,3,Small neigborhood bar with a reasonably priced daily menu
ChIJ89Mp86opQg0RZU7HRY1FjV4,4,"Nice place to have a drink and proper meal. They serve good tapas. Nothing fancy, but really Spanish bar with good atmosphere.
Be back for proper meal."
ChIJ89Mp86opQg0RZU7HRY1FjV4,5,Great tapas bar at night. Would recommend for those in Madrid.
ChIJ89Mp86opQg0RZU7HRY1FjV4,5,Beautiful tapas. I love the ceramic beer jars.
ChIJR01-wAApQg0RA_ysFeFqScw,4,Went there in late evening. Food is local and simple. The grilled vegetables came with eggplants and raw tomatoes. Fish was fresh and good.
ChIJR01-wAApQg0RA_ysFeFqScw,3,"Food was pretty decent, and decently priced. Server seemed grumpy that we were not Spanish speaking. Very bustling area (sat outside), so depends if that‚Äôs for you or not. Definitely lively, but we almost got taken out by some by some kids on roller blades multiple times."
ChIJR01-wAApQg0RA_ysFeFqScw,5,I left feeling the love of a granddad feeding me. Ive never had a grandparent ü•π
ChIJR01-wAApQg0RA_ysFeFqScw,5,"An amazing place in which you can stop by and eat dinner away from the tourist traps. Great service, and great food. Highly recommended 5‚≠êÔ∏è"
ChIJR01-wAApQg0RA_ysFeFqScw,4,Good place for a ca√±a or a vermut. Good tapas. Nice staff.
ChIJPbvMiaspQg0RGyx_ClNp4WI,5,"I am from the United States and I was blown away by the food. Amazing food,incredible service, friendly atmosphere, highly recommended to travelers and locals who want a true Spanish experience. Can't wait to come back!!"
ChIJPbvMiaspQg0RGyx_ClNp4WI,5,Great atmosphere like a traditional cervecer√≠a de Madrid with a plus of unique plates and Great service.
ChIJPbvMiaspQg0RGyx_ClNp4WI,5,"Friendly service, tasty tapas and great wine."
ChIJPbvMiaspQg0RGyx_ClNp4WI,5,"The best place to have breakfast, The pan tumaca my favorite. And The patatas revolconas are delicious üòã"
ChIJPbvMiaspQg0RGyx_ClNp4WI,5,"Great local spot, perfect to try out Spanish tapas with beer. The place is small and the zone in general is not very inviting.
Would recommend going if already in that part and hungry"
ChIJzzA3tQYpQg0R3c_k0zRwB4E,5,"A top-quality, reasonably priced Galician spot in the heart of Tetu√°n. They offer set menus and a la carte dishes, but the star of the show is their seafood platter which is more than enough for two, includes a very agreeable ribeiro wine, and came with a starter of their renowned empanada (tuna pie). It would be hard to beat these prices anywhere in Madrid, with this meal for three including wine and dessert coming in at just 88‚Ç¨. Andori√±a has been a surprising discovery - we visited recently after years living in the area and will definitely be back."
ChIJzzA3tQYpQg0R3c_k0zRwB4E,3,"Had the 55 ‚Ç¨ menu for 2. Empanadas we‚Äôre very tasty, then lobster rice which turned out ok. Service, however a little antagonistic. Tried and done."
ChIJzzA3tQYpQg0R3c_k0zRwB4E,5,"A very good experience in this charming restaurant with a very familiar atmosphere and so much love for the customer.
We liked the Galician empanada a lot, as did the pancakes."
ChIJzzA3tQYpQg0R3c_k0zRwB4E,4,"Small place with tables quite close together. Homemade, abundant and good quality food specializing in fish and seafood of all kinds. The waitress was charming, always with a smile. There are several ready-made menus that are phenomenal. To repeat!"
ChIJzzA3tQYpQg0R3c_k0zRwB4E,4,"The food was excellent and abundant. What wonderful dishes from the Galician broth, to the chicken schnitzel, or the delicious stew and the excellent Galician empanada, a true delight from the gods. The unbeatable service attention. I am lucky to live nearby and be able to enjoy this excellent food of unbeatable quality. And the delicious natural desserts. You can see the excellent work every day. The atmosphere of the neighborhood. Sometimes I eat there. Sometimes I take it home."
ChIJM4gcRAQpQg0RGfaKjZi-eHs,5,"Delicious, tasty, authentic
and Traditional, service was great, steak was so good üëçüèª
Prices are adorable
High quality products
Well recommended"
ChIJM4gcRAQpQg0RGfaKjZi-eHs,5,"Hidden gem!!! Best food in Madrid. If you have people visiting, this is the place. Make reservations! Best place to eat in this area. True Spanish food!! Friendly and attentive spot! Amazing/ fresh food! Unsure why this place doesn't have 5 stars!
Get the meat Al parilla, asparagus, croquettes, pulpo, vegetables, gambas al ajilo,salad with goat cheese"
ChIJM4gcRAQpQg0RGfaKjZi-eHs,5,"Great place to eat.  Staff are nice. They speak english which is good when im dinning alone as I don't speak Spanish.
The salad was great as well as the pulpo.
Its soooo delicious. Yummy!!"
ChIJM4gcRAQpQg0RGfaKjZi-eHs,4,"Decent tapas bar, service friendly and fast, my partner and I had 3 tapas and left very satisfied, for ‚Ç¨20.  They charge for bread which was disappointing."
ChIJM4gcRAQpQg0RGfaKjZi-eHs,5,"Updated: 3 years later this restaurant is still my favorite in Madrid and has the friendliest staff. It is truly my favorite and everyone makes you feel at home! They reserved a table for my going away at the bar and were very flexible. The servers are incredible and the host- truly thank you will miss this place !

One of the best restaurants in Madrid. Soooo casera and homemade üôèfriendly service, amazing food!! Get the lomo, salad w goat cheese, pulpo and croquettes! The asparagus is amazing !! Love this place and the staff!"
ChIJ3S_krAUpQg0R_Bqjl0gCga0,5,"I always come back to this restaurant every time I come back to madrid. It's nice food and service. The meat and tartar de Queso, my favourite
Will be coming back! It's totally recommended."
ChIJ3S_krAUpQg0R_Bqjl0gCga0,4,"The beef was on the warm plate to cook on the table. Once I had it in Santiago but I did not understand it well.

This time I really ate perfect beef !!! I love it the way how elegant we can eat meat !!!"
ChIJ3S_krAUpQg0R_Bqjl0gCga0,5,Love the salad and the beef. Shrimp a tad bit too salty. Cheesecake amazing! Will come back
ChIJ3S_krAUpQg0R_Bqjl0gCga0,5,"Want to have a great meal and get the best service?

This restaurant is something else. A total must do while in Madrid and an iconic place.
First of all, the service is just one of a kind really. They are committed to serve you and take care of you in the full sense of it. They bring a good appetizer first thing and end the experience with an artesian sweet treat. Then there‚Äôs the amazing cuisine‚Ä¶ üòã to die for. Top notch quality, great portions and such a knowledgeable crew. This restaurant deserves 6 stars and you will be a fool not to try while visiting Madrid. There‚Äôs a good reason all those pictures are put up in their walls‚Ä¶ celebrities from both Spain and internationally have stopped here to delight themselves in an absolute food paradise. Will be back for sure!"
ChIJ3S_krAUpQg0R_Bqjl0gCga0,1,"Very poor service. A couple of us asked for a well done steak. first came pretty much blue, asked them again to make it well done, it came back medium. The rest of the table had since by then finished their meals so we declined a further try. Asked for a dessert and never got it also. If it were not for the large starters would of gone very hungry. Oh and they still charged for the steaks we did not eat, and no apology either.  Shame as  i had heard good things about this place."
ChIJNT5AzhopQg0R0hLqnWQTezI,5,We enjoyed every single dish we ordered but particularly the artichoke and the fabada asturiana was full of smoked flavors. The steak as well was perfectly cooked. It‚Äôs a great place to go with a bigger group to try a different dishes. The restaurant opens early which is great for those of us not quite used to such late dinners. Highly recommended!
ChIJNT5AzhopQg0R0hLqnWQTezI,5,"Really great food, amazing service from Clemenet & the team. Must try tartare & cheesecake. Beautiful decorated.
Thank you."
ChIJNT5AzhopQg0R0hLqnWQTezI,5,"Delicious traditional food of exceptional quality. A well deserved Michelin restaurant worth a visit. A part from the perfectly crafted dishes made out of fresh ingredients this restaurant is delivering a complete experience. Their service is at top level, including starters at the house, perfect timings for when serving the food, friendly and professional staff."
ChIJNT5AzhopQg0R0hLqnWQTezI,5,We went there for a group dinner and everyone enjoyed their dinner. It was easy to make a reservation and they were very responsive. Great service!  All the food was delicious and served in a timely manner. The owner was very attentive and friendly. This was a great place and definitely would give it a try.
ChIJNT5AzhopQg0R0hLqnWQTezI,4,Good option for traditional food from Asturias (North of Spain) in an elegant venue with classic service.
ChIJqdEPOxApQg0R-ZHyatOwuSQ,4,"We were trying to get a reservation at El Botin, but could not get one before our departure. So a friend suggested this restaurant. You enter through a bar before arriving at the dining area. There were several people at the bar eating their tapas with beer or other drinks. Only 3 tables were occupied so it‚Äôs quite a relaxed atmosphere. The restaurant was a bit chilly so I could not even take off my jacket.

Our waiter talked like a machine gun and although we all speak Spanish I had to concentrate to understand what he was saying. Fortunately, we knew what we wanted so that went fine. As shared appetizers, we took fish, anchovies, and peppers plus grilled octopus with mashed potatoes. They were delicious. The highlight for us, was of course, the cochinillo and it was perfect. Another member of our party took pork intestines which were also quickly eaten. The usual white wine and beer as drinks and flan casero for dessert. All in all, an ok experience if you want to eat suckling pig. Lunch for 3 amounted to 144 Euros which was reasonable."
ChIJqdEPOxApQg0R-ZHyatOwuSQ,3,Dishes are nice and big. Especially if you order to share dish. I found it a bit expensive.
ChIJqdEPOxApQg0R-ZHyatOwuSQ,3,"The decor is a flashback to the 1980. The food is ok√© but not special. We got charged for appertisers that we didnt order a 2,20 pp.
The staff was really friendly. Thats what made the evening. All together we paid 160 euro for only 4 main courses, 8 drinks and 4 coffees. Not cheap, friendly staff, therible decor and mediocer food."
ChIJqdEPOxApQg0R-ZHyatOwuSQ,5,"Great restaurant and service. Suckling pig is a must to try here and black pudding. No this is not a dessert. Asparagus was crispy, not overcooked."
ChIJqdEPOxApQg0R-ZHyatOwuSQ,4,"A pleasant repeat lunch experience at this Asador El Molino in Madrid.
Food: salad and cordero very tasty
Drinks: house red wine (Rioja) and water
Excellent bread made onsite in a wood oven
No desert o coffee.
Price per pax: 40 euros"
ChIJDRwPZQQpQg0RbcJmgO1SkVU,5,"Absolutely amazing! Service was just perfect, food was delicious and on top of that we tried there the best cheesecake of all. If I could, I would give more stars. It is also possible to come here just for a drink and small tapas. For dinner it is better to make a reservation as it could be completely full."
ChIJDRwPZQQpQg0RbcJmgO1SkVU,5,"Friendly English speaking service, cozy interior, excellent dishes. Entrecote and cheesecake were excellent. The restaurant was rather full, so it is better to reserve your table upfront. We enjoyed our lunch here and can highly recommend this place."
ChIJDRwPZQQpQg0RbcJmgO1SkVU,5,"Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere is amazing here. Alvaro was super attentive with us, also ensuring we had everything we needed. Highly recommend!"
ChIJDRwPZQQpQg0RbcJmgO1SkVU,3,It was terrible. I couldn‚Äôt chew and swallow it. It‚Äôs like a bubblegum. My aunt wanted to go here as she tried it before and loves it but we‚Äôre disappointed. Truly disappointed. It was a waste of money though the cheesecake is good.
ChIJDRwPZQQpQg0RbcJmgO1SkVU,2,"Food is good, there is no doubt about it (octopus and the tortilla is a great option) but do not go there if you would like a good service. Unfortunately the maitre is not only rude, but he is even able to ruin your day with the way of not caring at all about his work there something I do not expect for the price it costs. It‚Äôs a pity, I have been continuously and heavily disappointed by the same reason the last couple of times I have been here"
ChIJ66xQvhopQg0R14S8Cs0KBFg,5,"Nice restaurante with superb quality of the products, the service is very friendly and attentive, the pricing is fair. We enjoyed the stay from the beginning and reccomend anyone to visit"
ChIJ66xQvhopQg0R14S8Cs0KBFg,3,"Extremely busy place on saturday. Good quality food: sea food rice and lamb. Extreme disorder in the service, we were not able to order dessert after 25 min waiting for the right waiter to attend us. (No luck this was always the wrong one). Asked the bill and went out without dessert. I guess during weekdays, this is less erratic."
ChIJ66xQvhopQg0R14S8Cs0KBFg,5,"The service was excellent, they kindly explained some of the plates. And the food spectacular. One of the best restaurants that I have tried in Spain. The prices are really reasonable. You won‚Äôt go wrong when you visit them."
ChIJ66xQvhopQg0R14S8Cs0KBFg,5,"L'abbraccio is the best restaurant in Madrid. It all starts with the service, the whole staff transmit passion for what they do. The wonderful food is the perfect consequence of this. The best recommendation for those seeking tradition, fair price and an unforgettable taste experience."
ChIJ66xQvhopQg0R14S8Cs0KBFg,4,"The place was brightly lit and has nice, tasteful interiors for relaxed dinner talks. The sourdough bread, the empanada,  tuna con tomato and apple pie were good, but the  tenderloin was not as tender. The staff though were very efficient and truly warm and friendly."
ChIJRw7CFQUpQg0Rh_knfASFXyg,3,"This is interesting restaurant. Very popular among locals. But the service and food here mediocre.

But the service could be better. You feel yourself not very comfortable here. Like the stuff is making you a favour. We had a female waitress and she was rude, rough and tired.

The food is good but for the price and location and weak service it is not so good.

I would recommend you to visit another place."
ChIJRw7CFQUpQg0Rh_knfASFXyg,5,Amazing must see place - the prawns were delicious and if your cholesterol levels are under check take a nibble of the broken eggs with French fries.
ChIJRw7CFQUpQg0Rh_knfASFXyg,5,"Chulet√≥n and tuna tartar were delicious.
Shrimp and the clams and croquetas were okay (mid). Service was TOP. Def come back for the chulet√≥n ü•©"
ChIJRw7CFQUpQg0Rh_knfASFXyg,5,"It was my fourth time visiting the restaurant, and I have to say that it was as amazing as the previous times. The food, the wine, the staff, and the atmosphere were just perfect. Highly recommended. ‚úÖ"
ChIJRw7CFQUpQg0Rh_knfASFXyg,3,"Excellent wine selection, olives, sausages, and cheese platter.  Downhill from there. Not one staff person spoke English though they were friendly and did their best.  The bread was hard and sent back.  The potatoes were oily and salty.  The steak was served rare when medium was requested.  It was also sent back, butterflied, and then tasted delicious.  Crab croquettes were served when oxtail croquettes were ordered.  They were mushy.
The restaurant is not vegetarian friendly.  It seemed overpriced."
ChIJF-bmuxopQg0R7XOl_5HGRCU,3,"Certainly! Here's the improved version:

""The place has an amazing ambiance, and the food was delicious. Both the pasta and pizza arrived piping hot.

However, the reason for this rating is due to the bland service we received. Despite sitting outside, the waitress seemed to be having a bad day, showing no signs of friendliness or kindness when taking our orders. She also removed items from the table without asking for permission.

It's disappointing because a restaurant should provide a great overall experience, including service.

La Tagliatella looks great, but to achieve perfection, it needs a friendlier staff.

Thank you for reading this review."
ChIJF-bmuxopQg0R7XOl_5HGRCU,2,"Not worth the money. Abundant food on the plates, big portions, but not even the pasta is homemade, it's purchased in a store. No olive oil or similar on the table. The staff is very attentive and effective and the interior design is absolutely  astonising. But too pricy for the quality of food and the all in all impresion"
ChIJF-bmuxopQg0R7XOl_5HGRCU,5,I love the interior and decor of this Italian restaurant. It is so different and so rich in detail. Good prices for big portions of lovely italian food.
ChIJF-bmuxopQg0R7XOl_5HGRCU,5,"Very good please with great food foe any one in love with the Italian food, just visit this place. The sheep cheese salad ü•ó was super amazing mixed with pineapple and fresh tomatoes üçÖ, this was a salad to remember"
ChIJF-bmuxopQg0R7XOl_5HGRCU,2,Food is good but service could be improved. We had late dinner on a Saturday and felt rushed the entire time we were there... From the moment we ordered to the moment we left. Unprofessional staff.
ChIJc-56VgUpQg0Rpyh1N_qD68k,5,"Absolutely amazing place. Excelent services with attentive staff. The food was well done cooked. Not a cheap place but the quality of services and food worths. So if you want to treat yourself of others, you definitely need to pay them a visit."
ChIJc-56VgUpQg0Rpyh1N_qD68k,5,"Meat, meat, meat - all about a good meet here. But my vegan friends were able to get a separate vegan menu, and they did not look disappointed. On a pricier spectrum, and the service was a bit slow - but we did not come here to rush. The experience was delightful. I recommend!"
ChIJc-56VgUpQg0Rpyh1N_qD68k,5,"Hands down the most delicious food I had during my time in Spain! This restaurant in Madrid completely blew me away. The meat was perfectly cooked, the salad with burrata was so fresh and flavorful, and the artichokes were absolutely amazing.

To top it all off, the house dessert was incredible‚Äîespecially the lemon and cava sorbet, such a refreshing and elegant finish to the meal.

The service was just as impressive as the food. The waiters were attentive, friendly, and always there when we needed anything without being intrusive.

I would 100% recommend this place to everyone I know visiting Madrid. A must-try experience!"
ChIJc-56VgUpQg0Rpyh1N_qD68k,4,"Loads of food for a decent price.
Got a tasting menu which was way too much unfortunately & they do bring things way too quick.
But overall, good food, especially when you're hungry"
ChIJc-56VgUpQg0Rpyh1N_qD68k,5,"An Unexpected Encounter. While searching for a nearby restaurant close to our hotel, we stumbled upon one of the finest steakhouses imaginable, highly recommended by others. As we waited for the sumptuous morcilla de Burgos and the Galician Blonde ‚ÄúCowboy‚Äù steak (a full kilogram of pure flavor), we were treated to delicious chistorras and a rich p√¢t√© to whet our appetites. Everything was perfectly paired with a fine bottle of Protos red wine for an impeccable combination. The atmosphere, while not sophisticated, is full of character and feels exceptionally inviting. The experience is elevated by a sizzling hot iron plate brought to your table, allowing you to sear each piece of meat to your personal preference. Eleven out of ten."
ChIJOfIWABspQg0RFlOxqNyvMZE,5,"Cl√°sico omelette, caf√© con leche, and a bacon sandwich; all delicious!  Great staff and sat at the counter!"
ChIJOfIWABspQg0RFlOxqNyvMZE,5,"In my opinion, one of the best tortillas in Madrid, they offers you variations with another ingredients like: chesse, deer, morcilla..."
ChIJOfIWABspQg0RFlOxqNyvMZE,3,"Food was good. Service was good. Atmosphere was fun. Prices were good. Not much to complain about, the food just didn't blow my mind."
ChIJOfIWABspQg0RFlOxqNyvMZE,5,"Superb bar/restaurant, huge dishes, typical Spanish, homely cooking, unbeatable prices, great staff. I have now become a fan! Highly recommended."
ChIJOfIWABspQg0RFlOxqNyvMZE,3,Great attention but still Cafe Bar.  If you work around it would be an option for brunch (Spanish style = Pintxo + Coffe or Beer) or eventually an executive menu when you don't have time to go home
ChIJ8zIhVwUpQg0RH08RETEzJ4s,4,"I really loved this place, great staff all are so nice and welcoming , amazing food quality and portions in an incredible atmosphere that brings you back in time. The paella menu is so filling we had to take some back home in 2 people!I must admit this may ve been one of the best paella I d in madrid (marisco) so tasteful rich and ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù at the bottom. I highly recommend this spot, I wish in a nice day in their lovely terrace! Will be definitely back!"
ChIJ8zIhVwUpQg0RH08RETEzJ4s,5,"Highly recommended place for a good paella dishes at this place. You will get spread of appetizers, main course and desserts that are delicious. You surely will come out from this restaurant having food coma because the food so good and you can‚Äôt stop eating. The service by the crew was friendly and good."
ChIJ8zIhVwUpQg0RH08RETEzJ4s,5,Authentic place with tasty paella and no tourist crowds. Great if one looks for a real Madrid experience.
ChIJ8zIhVwUpQg0RH08RETEzJ4s,5,"The food here is great and the rice dish is unbelievably good. I ordered the Paella Negra and it was true to the tradition (I‚Äôve been to several Paella restaurants). Staff is helpful and friendly! I didn‚Äôt know the place‚Äôs rules (min two ppl) but yet, they welcomed me and the service was incredible. 100% recommend."
ChIJ8zIhVwUpQg0RH08RETEzJ4s,5,Best traditional rice dish
ChIJFy6SvAgpQg0R24FmupOvLgE,3,"Very local feel, generous portions, unfortunately the staff do not speak English (my fault for not learning Spanish) however they managed to explain to us that what we had intended to order would be too much (which he was right), so I appreciate his honesty.

There is no English menu, so clearly you need to be able to speak Spanish.. or be prepared to translate your menu.

Calamari was good, croquettes (we have had better around Madrid). Personally we thought they were just okay.  Grilled mushroom was too cheesy for our liking, however I‚Äôm sure others would enjoy.

I am sure other items on the menu are tasty, however this visit we did not leave completely satisfied ."
ChIJFy6SvAgpQg0R24FmupOvLgE,4,"I spent such a lovely Valentine‚Äôs dinner, first time dining here. The bar looked super busy, but the place features a big two rooms restaurant for reserved sittings which I found very intimate, besides the background music choice. Food was spot on delicious, probably the best pulpo a la gallega I can remember! The zamburi√±as we got weren‚Äôt that special to be honest, but I really enjoyed the gambas al ajillo, succulent and tasty!!
The waiter was friendly and professional, we also got free digestive at the end. Prices are fair for such food quality, highly recommended and will surely be back!"
ChIJFy6SvAgpQg0R24FmupOvLgE,5,"This was a very nice, traditional restaurant, the food is also delicious. We especially liked the empanada, it was perfectly crispy! One downside is that the stuff cannot speak English, they were however friendly and patient with us."
ChIJFy6SvAgpQg0R24FmupOvLgE,5,Authentic Galician restaurant in Madrid. The sea  food soup was out this world -- so delicious.  The pulpo gallego was excellent as well. We enjoyed being there and are planning to come back in the future when we are in Madrid. Compliments to Sami the chef and Santo our kind and attentive waiter.
ChIJFy6SvAgpQg0R24FmupOvLgE,2,"I couldn't get far with the service, no English menu, no WiFi. I had to get something simple in the end."
ChIJT28e3BopQg0RLtyJ1e-I2ZY,5,"Very nice restaurant with a refined decoration.
The dishes are very tasty and hearty. Most tasty paella ever tasted.
Staff are very nice , gentil and kind."
ChIJT28e3BopQg0RLtyJ1e-I2ZY,5,Absolutely delicious Spanish restaurant located at the Hotel Melia Castillo. The service was outstanding. Recommend the paella - we had the squid ink paella but there were others as well. The jamon iberico was outstanding. Recommend the grand mariner souffl√© for dessert. Very special restaurant!
ChIJT28e3BopQg0RLtyJ1e-I2ZY,1,"Disappointing. Situated inside the Meli√° hotel, L'Albufera is a posh paella-style rice place. They won the Sueca prize for the best paella in 2015, so our expectations were high. We usually go for the ""senyoret"", but the one they make here comes with chicken, which is not our thing. Instead, we ordered the vegetable rice, which we knew was a risky choice. What we were served, however, was worse than what we could have ever imagined. Not only did it lack salt, but the ingredients (artichoke, cauliflower and green beens) had almost no flavor. Our feeling was that they use low-quality produce because the tomato salad we had as a starter was similarly tasteless."
ChIJT28e3BopQg0RLtyJ1e-I2ZY,5,"This restaurant was recommended by a local Spanish friend as the best place for paella. We
had a delicious paella, the atmosphere was amazing and the staff was friendly and helpful. Thank you for the wonderful food and experience."
ChIJT28e3BopQg0RLtyJ1e-I2ZY,5,"I had a wonderful experience at Restaurante L'Albufera. The ambience was pleasant - it offers a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The service was excellent, with attentive and friendly staff. And, of course, the paella was absolutely delicious."
ChIJNT40iAQpQg0RECVK216OnHY,4,"La Maquina Original in Madrid is a true gem for anyone seeking an exceptional dining experience. From the moment you walk in, you‚Äôre greeted with an inviting ambiance that sets the stage for a memorable meal. The food here is simply amazing. Each dish is crafted with meticulous attention to detail, showcasing the best of Spanish cuisine. The flavors are authentic, rich, and perfectly balanced, making every bite a delight.

The service is outstanding, adding to the overall excellence of the experience. The staff are not only professional and efficient but also warm and welcoming. They go above and beyond to ensure that every guest feels taken care of, making the dining experience feel personal and special.

One of the most impressive aspects of La Maquina Original is the value. Despite the high quality of the food and service, the prices are very reasonable. It‚Äôs rare to find a restaurant that delivers such an exceptional experience without breaking the bank.

Whether you‚Äôre a local or a visitor to Madrid, La Maquina Original is a must-visit. The combination of amazing food, outstanding service, and wonderful value makes it a standout choice for anyone looking to enjoy a truly memorable meal."
ChIJNT40iAQpQg0RECVK216OnHY,5,"We had fantastic dinner. Everything was delicious and the service was prompt and friendly. We had delicious artichokes, oysters, my husband got grilled cod and I had the Bilbao style monkfish üòã all were well done üòã Jorge was a great host ü§© üíù thank you all üëèüëèüëè"
ChIJNT40iAQpQg0RECVK216OnHY,5,"Nice restaurant with lovely seafood, fresh ingredients and fantastic staff! I d really an enjoyable dinner I d recommend!"
ChIJNT40iAQpQg0RECVK216OnHY,1,"Last Wednesday I ate with a friend at your restaurant. The bill was for  little more than ‚Ç¨130, and I asked to be charged ‚Ç¨150 by credit card.
The waitress tipped in the sum on the machine, I tapped my credit card and PIN and it was paid.
I normally do not look too carefully before taping my pin. Assuming that the amount is correct.
However, this time, as I tapped OK I noticed that I had just paid ‚Ç¨450 instead of ‚Ç¨250.
I told the waitress, she apologized profusely, undid the wrong payment and I then paid the correct ‚Ç¨150.

This should simply not happen. This may have been a typo by the waitress but I cannot help thinking that it probably was not.

The next morning I wanted to report the incident to the restaurant and filled in their online form, but was unable to get it sent, repeatedly getting a message to ‚Äútry later ‚Äú. After a few days with this, I sent them an email. Still no answer at all.

This is simply not good enough.

If you eat here, the food and atmosphere is fine, but be aware when you pay."
ChIJNT40iAQpQg0RECVK216OnHY,4,A bit busy and noisy but great food and ok service. The monk fish is really nice and juicy and so is the squid. The hamon so so.
ChIJIfCbPAUpQg0RjjSI_io3Fps,4,"I came for the Paella.  Unfortunately I was by myself, and the Paella is for a minimum of two persons.

I tried the Russian Salad.  This was a plate of Tuna Salad with a layer of mayonnaise on top, not delicious, but ok.

I also had Gambas al Ajillo, which is Shrimp with Garlic.  This was very tasty and worth the stop.  It also came with toasted bread that was good."
ChIJIfCbPAUpQg0RjjSI_io3Fps,4,"The food quality is awesome. The top 3 fish restaurants in Madrid.
Atmosphere like furniture etc could be improved to match the vibe of the restaurant."
ChIJIfCbPAUpQg0RjjSI_io3Fps,3,"The lobster was super fresh. The shrimp on the other hand was so so. I'm a shrimp enthusiast so I know when my shrimp isn't the freshest. Service was good. What I disliked was the fact that the plate of seafood was 150 when the guy told me it was 75. He should've indicate it was per person. Overall, food quality is ok and a bit over-priced."
ChIJIfCbPAUpQg0RjjSI_io3Fps,1,"Terrible service, mediocre food. Our waiter was actually nice, but when we asked for anything another angry waiter would come saying no. They forced us to pay a menu for my wife, on the assumption she would eat part of my menu. And there was only one desert option, even though the menu said three. One of the worst experiences I had in Madrid, having visited 200+ restaurants."
ChIJIfCbPAUpQg0RjjSI_io3Fps,4,"Fresh seafood restaurant with shipments coming from around Spain every mornin. Coming here around 1PM to get started with beers and tapas. At 2PM, get seated upstairs surrounded with pictures of celebrities, the owner must have taken pictures with every celebrity visited here!

The highlight of the meal is the very high quality ham served with bread and extra virgin olive oil. The ham in Spain is made from pigs raised for 3 years, then marinate the meat in salt for 1.5 month, and air dry for another 3 years in a temperature controlled room. It‚Äôs a must order here. Paella is delicious with shrimp and lobster, also a must try at Portobello.

üç°For those who don‚Äôt know how to get when looking at a menu, orderüç°

ChIJXxQnBQ8pQg0RiKhbca_a1wM,5,Nice food and especially recommended Racion de Cochinillo!
ChIJXxQnBQ8pQg0RiKhbca_a1wM,2,21.10.2018: dun waste your time and money
ChIJXxQnBQ8pQg0RiKhbca_a1wM,4,Far away from tourist traps. Pretty much only locals are found here. It says it all. Good food. Good price. Friendly service. They even tried to speak English with us to help. Could not ask for more!
ChIJXxQnBQ8pQg0RiKhbca_a1wM,4,Delicious tapas
ChIJXxQnBQ8pQg0RiKhbca_a1wM,5,Good experience of authentic Spanish food that too at reasonable cost.
ChIJSzNGEQQpQg0RH-cBa_PzOfo,5,"We enjoyed our lunch here very much. Friendly service, menu in English, delicious tapas and good wine. Prices are bit higher, but it can be related to the size of the portions. As couple we took three tapas and it cost us space for the dessert. Nevertheless, the very nice owner of the place served us with a complimentary chocolate truffle. All in all, recommended."
ChIJSzNGEQQpQg0RH-cBa_PzOfo,5,"Great experience. A red wine was excellent as well as the meals we ordered. The portions are quite big, friendly service, cozy atmosphere. You can feel there like a local."
ChIJSzNGEQQpQg0RH-cBa_PzOfo,3,"Very average unfortunately. Selection of tapas style dishes not particularly exciting , or a that good ingredients. Lot better Ibericos for example & anchovies have been had. Wouldn‚Äôt return. Service ok and split portions for single person. But overall, wasn‚Äôt overwhelmed. La Cantina round the corner is a better bet."
ChIJSzNGEQQpQg0RH-cBa_PzOfo,5,This was some of the best tappas I've ever had. The waiter was extremely friendly. His English skills maybe weren't the best (and I have no Spanish knowledge) but in the end everything worked out. Will go here again to try some more tappas. Thanks!
ChIJSzNGEQQpQg0RH-cBa_PzOfo,5,"Excellent home made food, and the service is great; wednesdays is always ""coco madrile√±o""...
It was delicious I live having lunch, tapas and dining here.
And Emilio, the owner is great!"
ChIJLeNYlRopQg0Ri_oCCOmlBcQ,4,Expensive... But not sure whether it really scaled to taste..didn't like much..
ChIJLeNYlRopQg0Ri_oCCOmlBcQ,5,"I actually will give it another try‚Ä¶

I quite liked my first visit to this place. Unfortunately I was on the whole30 diet month and couldn‚Äôt have all I wanted. But the menu looked absolutely fantastic. What I had was of good quality and fresh products. Service was excellent so for the experience and quality I give them my 5 stars and I will try again and see what are those other yummy options on their menu."
ChIJLeNYlRopQg0Ri_oCCOmlBcQ,4,"Hello the staff are friendly and welcoming can speak English and Spanish , the food is good , sea food soup tomato tuna salad octopus grilled‚Ä¶. The only thing need to update his decor and ambiance it‚Äôs very classic not my favorite."
ChIJLeNYlRopQg0Ri_oCCOmlBcQ,5,"Popped in here, glad I did. Very friendly staff who despite saying they didn't speak English did much better than my Spanish. Nice quiet place. Good menu which is fortunately heavily seafood based but there is also a choice for meat eaters as well. The fried squid was excellent and the baby monkfish with grilled vegetables was super fresh. And looking at what other customers were eating, I could see satisfaction everywhere. Highly recommend."
ChIJLeNYlRopQg0Ri_oCCOmlBcQ,5,"I tried Sevilla branch before and it was amazing. This one no difference, Delicious food, friendly staff and nice atmosphere."
ChIJj236uBwpQg0R4nmrMfwr5ic,5,The servers are always nice. The ambiance is good for hanging out and chatting with friends. Some people do bring their laptops and work there (for me just that the lights are a little dim for reading/working) but you can get the window table to have more light.
ChIJj236uBwpQg0R4nmrMfwr5ic,4,"This place has certainly improved since I last visited about a year ago. This time I was greeted by a friendly waiter who prepared a table immediately for me. The order was taken very quickly and the food arrived within minutes. A delicious brunch which I thoroughly enjoyed. However.‚Ä¶ I really wanted to have a second Americano coffee, but it was almost impossible to attract the attention of the staff who seemed to be either Behind the counter talking to each other or had disappeared into the kitchen, and when they did appear, they rushed past so quickly. They did not hear me trying to get their attention. Because I had a few phone calls to make, I stayed at the table for about 10 or 15 minutes after finishing, but nobody came up to me to ask if I wanted anything else. Dirty plates remain on the table which is a real no-no as far as I am concerned. The staff should be looking at all times to see when the customers have finished, approach them a few minutes after take away the dirty plates and ask if they would like anything else. That said, the food was delicious, the coffee was hot and the fresh orange juice was very tasty. I will come back, but if the small things are rectified, and they are so easily rectified, then it deserves five stars."
ChIJj236uBwpQg0R4nmrMfwr5ic,3,Below the standard of Le Pain Quotidian. It is not well mantained (the toilets were not clean). The food is fine but missing the good details of LPQ. The service is poor as well.
ChIJj236uBwpQg0R4nmrMfwr5ic,2,"The worst service ever. I had ordered 2 plain croissants, paid and then told to wait aside for my coffee, 2 separate orders came after me and she gave them my croissants. By the time I got my coffee I asked her what about the croissants and she said they are out! But I ordered first!! Also, ordered a quiche as she told us it has cheese and tomato jam, (this was also written in the menu, made sure as we don't eat meat).When I started eating it I saw it had cubes of ham in it! The woman taking our order said it was vegetarian.. The quality of food is good and as expected at any Le Quotidien. However, the tiny cold cup of coffee for 2.6euro did not save my doomed breakfast."
ChIJj236uBwpQg0R4nmrMfwr5ic,5,"I spent my mornings having breakfast at Le Pain Quotidien whilst getting my work done.  The food was scrumptious.  The atmosphere was conducive for remote work and the service was always excellent.  Walking distance from the Tetuan Metro station - you should visit them for breakfast, lunch or dinner."
ChIJxyh2XA8pQg0RmPF5D-pMi3k,5,"we had initially bad luck with the waiter so things where slow. but then the owner took it on him self to make the expiriences good and man the meat was amazing and the the plate of sweats was super amazing.
i recomend this place for sure, it seemed like our waiter was new and nervous e coz all the others seemed much more active.
So yes if you want a non touristic authentic Madrid ambient this is the place and plaza to be.
highly commended"
ChIJxyh2XA8pQg0RmPF5D-pMi3k,2,"The food I had was not great  and overpriced in my opinion. The menu did not have prices on it and the starter recommended by the waitress was over 22 euro  (pulpa), and was not particularly good . Perhaps other dishes are good."
ChIJxyh2XA8pQg0RmPF5D-pMi3k,4,"The food is good, but not the money's worth. There are better options.
The bar is cosy, but the restaurant has the atmosphere of a railway station."
ChIJxyh2XA8pQg0RmPF5D-pMi3k,5,Great place to have typical Spanish food. The neighbourhood is a bit weird but if you turned to be in this part of the city defo worth it
ChIJxyh2XA8pQg0RmPF5D-pMi3k,5,"Went in hoping for a light meal of tapas, but we found out after sitting down (and having a tablecloth laid out in front of us!) that they only had a full-on menu and a raci√≥n menu (with lots of overlap between the two).
I felt bad ordering such ""normal"" foods at a dedicated Galician restaurant: fried king oyster mushrooms (setas empanadas con alioli), tortilla de patatas, and fried eggs with jam√≥n (huevos rotos).
Surprisingly, everything really exceeded my expectations - fresh and nicely prepared. The tortilla was the best I've had in my life, actually! We only ordered 3 dishes among 3 people, but walked out feeling like we'd burst.
The owner (?) was friendly, and chatted with us about the plate of spicy chorizo from Zamora that he offered us gratis. It was a really relaxed time.
I'll be back to try their actual Galician dishes!"
ChIJdbJMVAUpQg0RCRxBd3iG2ls,5,"We just loved it. So delicious everything. Pulpo and ternera gallega just perfect!
Croquetas so creamy and tasty.
Ca√±itas de crema for dessert riqu√≠simo.
Vino de casa Barallobre albari√±o great choice!
Customer service so attentive and pleasant. Very fast serving and cozy atmosphere.
Muchas gracias :)"
ChIJdbJMVAUpQg0RCRxBd3iG2ls,3,"We ate spanish omelete and buffalo cheese and tomato salad.
Food was good but the quantity it was very small.
Service was good except that we order water and they brought us a small bottle of water for 2,2‚Ç¨ and to the table near us they brought them a jar of water for free, it is good if they ask you to choose instead of them choosing what you want...."
ChIJdbJMVAUpQg0RCRxBd3iG2ls,5,I loved this food. The ternerilla is delicious
ChIJdbJMVAUpQg0RCRxBd3iG2ls,5,"The Croquetas of Ternera are amazing.
Great service"
ChIJdbJMVAUpQg0RCRxBd3iG2ls,5,One of the best Spanish omelettes that I've ever had. Service was good as well.
ChIJAffzOwQpQg0RL4NeGNVU7xQ,5,Small but very lovely place. Service was very pleasant and the food was tasty. I enjoyed my Iberian ham baguette. And the Callos con garbanzos was also very tasty. See you again.
ChIJAffzOwQpQg0RL4NeGNVU7xQ,4,It‚Äôs a concept restaurant version of 100 Montaditos. It‚Äôs fair but needs something more special...
ChIJAffzOwQpQg0RL4NeGNVU7xQ,5,"This place is a great option in the district of Tetu√°n. They are specialized in ‚Äúricos molletes‚Äù . The service is really good, they are very polite and efficient. :) I like it!"
ChIJAffzOwQpQg0RL4NeGNVU7xQ,5,"Great food and service, nice terrace!"
ChIJAffzOwQpQg0RL4NeGNVU7xQ,4,"Yummy molletes with andalusian toppings including my favorite, manteca color√°, in a pleasant setting near plaza castilla with patio seating. A good place if you're in the mood for something a little special for breakfast."
ChIJH78u4A4pQg0RV029aYkz6-I,4,"Traditional Spanish restaurant locating in a quiet area, outside of Centre.
Owner was nice but a bit pushy, we went at the wrong time, after lunch, the suckling pig was not as good as expected.

However, the owner was so nice to offer free liquor and dessert.

Price is on the high side."
ChIJH78u4A4pQg0RV029aYkz6-I,5,"Loved the food! Very good prices. It‚Äôs a small family-owned business, so you know you‚Äôll have an amazing service!"
ChIJH78u4A4pQg0RV029aYkz6-I,5,"excellent spot for real spaniard food. Cochinillo (pig) and cordero (lamb) are cooked in a wood oven. The owner is always on site, she is amazing, the staff is super friendly. Good value for money"
ChIJH78u4A4pQg0RV029aYkz6-I,5,"Best suckling pig I had in a while!
Olga, the owner is a delight and always eager to do her best for her customers."
ChIJH78u4A4pQg0RV029aYkz6-I,5,"This is very local and traditional place , not touristy. The service was amazing and food delicious. We had chorizo, cochinillo, lamb and ensalada de la casa. If you want to try something authentic and out of the tourist area I highly recommend it."
ChIJqzIWJgQpQg0RKz1b4OwkSdU,5,Clean and cozy resto with outdoor tables where you can enjoy the sun while having coffee/beer or meals...
ChIJqzIWJgQpQg0RKz1b4OwkSdU,4,"If you've been to 100 Montaditos you'll get the same experience here as you do at their other restaurants. There's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. They keep everything clean and the service is good but nothing to write home about. The tiny sandwiches are tasty and there are a ton to choose from, so there's something for just about any taste. Plus, they serve beer and a variety of sodas. I'd say it's a step above fastfood and definitely worth a visit, especially if you're on a budget."
ChIJqzIWJgQpQg0RKz1b4OwkSdU,5,Always a great place to hang out.
ChIJqzIWJgQpQg0RKz1b4OwkSdU,4,Very nice place to have small portions for a cheap price
ChIJqzIWJgQpQg0RKz1b4OwkSdU,3,Good place to have something quick and nice.
ChIJ3eumagQpQg0ROpRrOTVtaYQ,4,"Sushi is reliably ok, though not outstanding. Menu verges on the fusion-style Japanese/Chinese fare. The restaurant is roomy and a pleasant place to dine in. Service is reliably good. A bit pricey but they handed over 15‚Ç¨ discount for ‚Ç¨70+ meal, which was nice."
ChIJ3eumagQpQg0ROpRrOTVtaYQ,5,Mi favorito !!! Los camareros soy muy educados - very polite and lovely waitress and staff. Calm atmosphere i loved it I can‚Äôt express it. Amazing food will fill you it‚Äôs so tasty ! If u are a tourist in Madrid this is a must to come and visit ü´∂üèº
ChIJ3eumagQpQg0ROpRrOTVtaYQ,5,"Great price for amount you get. For their lunch special I paid 13.96 and got miso soup, a sushi roll and three pieces of nigiri, chicken teriyaki, and a choice of desert. I recommend for desert to get the ice cream. The matcha flan was a interesting dish to try but I did not like the mix of flavors. The chicken teriyaki was not the best so I recommend trying something else."
ChIJ3eumagQpQg0ROpRrOTVtaYQ,2,"2 stars only for the service because they were nice and they tried their best.
The food was bad (uramaki with rice not compact and salmon tartar blended, see photos).

We waited a lot and we left before even finishing the degustation menu. (Saturday at lunch time)

Really not recommended."
ChIJ3eumagQpQg0ROpRrOTVtaYQ,4,"Good sushi and service, a menu of the day is enough for a normal person but doesn‚Äôt have too many options"
ChIJYyWfQQQpQg0Rq8oLn8zX6GE,5,"The restaurant servers were cordial. Food came within a reasonable time. The furniture, wall decor, and overall space was well-thought out. I ordered Okra, Crispy Lemon Chicken, and Dumplings - all exceeded my expectations. I had a great time and enjoyed my experience at this restaurant."
ChIJYyWfQQQpQg0Rq8oLn8zX6GE,5,"One of the best meals out I've ever had. The staff were super friendly and attentive. The food was another level. We had dumplings to start, then udon noodles, soft shell crab & duck with almond sauce. To finish M, we had a green tea and coffee with ginger and coconut milk. Cannot recommend this place enough. We loved it. I would give this place 6 out of 5 if I could."
ChIJYyWfQQQpQg0Rq8oLn8zX6GE,4,"made my way there for lunch alone. The waiters were very attentive, friendly and polite.

Food wise the taste is ok but in my opinion I feel that it is a very watered down version of authentic chinese cuisine. Ordered the mutton skewers and it is lacking in mutton fat and cumin (most important spice for this dish). As for the spicy wontons, was not very spicy (probably to suit local palate), but the wonton skin kept disintegrating and easily. The seaweed & egg soup was ok.

Overall, will be back again to try the other dishes as I chose the simplest ones."
ChIJYyWfQQQpQg0Rq8oLn8zX6GE,5,"Frist time to dine at this very nice restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised about the great service and delicious food which was served. Whether you're vegan, vegetarian or meateater, every one can find plenty to eat. Free startes were roasted salted edamame, what a wonderful surprise! Without a doubt, we will be back. Public parking next door makes getting there easy peasy.üëç"
ChIJYyWfQQQpQg0Rq8oLn8zX6GE,5,"Amazing in every way!! The kindest staff ever, food is so good you can't stop ordering! Do not miss the gyoza and the ribs! Also, do not leave without trying the baked pineapple with pepper sauce and their ginmoji (gin mojito) which are to die for! We will come back over and over again. Highly recommended!"
ChIJFcvOkwQpQg0RILf1Dfw-0lM,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Sabor Gaucho, and it was truly a standout experience from start to finish. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere set the tone for a warm and welcoming evening. The vibe was perfect‚Äîideal for families, friends, or anyone looking to enjoy a lively yet relaxed meal together.

Having visited many Brazilian steakhouses across the U.S., I can confidently say that Sabor Gaucho is one for the books. The service was nothing short of excellent. The staff was attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure our experience was flawless. It felt as though every detail was carefully thought out to make guests feel valued and comfortable.

As for the food, it was exceptional. The salad buffet offered a fantastic selection‚Äîfresh, vibrant, and diverse. It perfectly complemented the main courses, which were cooked to perfection. Each cut of steak was flavorful, tender, and expertly prepared, showcasing the culinary skills that Sabor Gaucho is clearly known for.

To round it all off, I indulged in one of the best caipirinhas I‚Äôve ever had. Balanced, refreshing, and perfectly made, it was the ideal accompaniment to the meal.

Whether you‚Äôre planning a special occasion or just looking for an incredible meal with friends or family, I wholeheartedly recommend Sabor Gaucho. It has raised the bar for Brazilian steakhouses, and it‚Äôs a dining experience I won‚Äôt forget anytime soon!"
ChIJFcvOkwQpQg0RILf1Dfw-0lM,1,"Made a reservation over the phone with Sabor Gaucho, arrived to be told I hadn't done so. When I pressed redial, the phone rang on the receptionist desk. Still he denied I had a reservation.  Amazingly my name was in his book , oh"" thats a different person"" he claimed. Full up tonight, can't help you! I was furious but what could I do except leave this awful review , which I've never done before.
Thanks Sabor Gaucho for ruining my night and embarrassing me in front of my work colleagues. I wouldn't go there again if the food was free."
ChIJFcvOkwQpQg0RILf1Dfw-0lM,5,"Excellent service. Lots of options for the buffet and the meat quality is good. Highly recommend the picanha option, very juicy and tender. The tropical fruit juice is great too."
ChIJFcvOkwQpQg0RILf1Dfw-0lM,5,"Great food, If you want a fancy restaurant with quality food that will satisfy your appetite, this is the place! Very good, thanks!"
ChIJFcvOkwQpQg0RILf1Dfw-0lM,4,"Overall good. Meat quality good, not exceptional. Waiters super nice, good atmosphere, good starters and meat is rolling quite often.
For me the rate should be 3.9"
ChIJhT8kIAIpQg0R81PQDAsVrFo,5,"We ordered Tacos Dorados both beef and chicken, Maduro(banana with fried cheese), and Volc√°n. SO GOOD really recommended to try this restaurant!"
ChIJhT8kIAIpQg0R81PQDAsVrFo,3,First time visiting the place. The food is average. A bit sad to have my avocado not as pretty as my friend‚Äôs‚Ä¶ some darks areas.  I didn‚Äôt eat it for sure.
ChIJhT8kIAIpQg0R81PQDAsVrFo,5,"Awesome and authentic Nicarag√ºense restaurant! Approved by my Nicarag√ºense wife üòâ.
Authentic and extremely well tasting food!
Tacos dorados just to die for üòç.
Plato Fuerte a well balanced mix of Nica tastes. Ohh the chicken marinated in achiote was just amazing!üòã

Today they had a special that the wife ordered in a jiffy! Nacatamales which also we're awesome!

As for dessert, she choose tres leches which also was very yummy üòã.

Of course I ended with a Flor de Ca√±a 7y and a coffee.

Well worth the 15‚Ç¨ taxi fare from Gran Via, and highly recommended!"
ChIJhT8kIAIpQg0R81PQDAsVrFo,4,"Food was really good I felt like back home in Nicaragua. Only thing I didn't like was that the chicken in the volcano plate had bbq sauce which is not that nicaraguan or latin. They had pupusas which are Salvadoran but I  love and that you also find in Nic. Staff was not really that talkative, which is ok if you're like me and don't care bc you only want your food to be good."
ChIJhT8kIAIpQg0R81PQDAsVrFo,1,Food is expensive and not that delicious.
ChIJ9RC9YBkpQg0RPL1JhDKMkzc,3,"If you go there, you'll feel like you're in Texas. There are lots of decorations, a lunch menu, and the service could be better. It's not the friendliest place, but the food is decent for the price.
Give it a try. You might get lucky, and you'll be treated fairly."
ChIJ9RC9YBkpQg0RPL1JhDKMkzc,4,"Been here several times because, despite their known reputation, quality is constant. Good products, simple elaboration.
Not going for 5 stars, and this is very subjective, because depending on the staff, your customer satisfaction will vary. This should be improved if you want to be top class."
ChIJ9RC9YBkpQg0RPL1JhDKMkzc,5,"Best place in Madrid for eating a quick burguer with friends or family. The meat is supreme quality!
Always better if you book a table because it is really popular, even more on weekends"
ChIJ9RC9YBkpQg0RPL1JhDKMkzc,3,"If you‚Äôre an American feeling homesick, I recommend giving Alfredo‚Äôs a try. They serve burgers, chili, and Budweiser, and you‚Äôre surrounded by American flags (not really supportive of the Confederate flag they have hanging from the ceiling but to each his own). That being said, I‚Äôm afraid the quality of food here isn‚Äôt to my ‚Äúfoodie‚Äù standards. I ordered the Goat Burger and had high expectations for the goat cheese and caramelized onions. It was good, just not as good as I had hoped. Be careful with how you like your meat cooked here. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúpoco hecho‚Äù kind of girl and boy did Alfredo‚Äôs take me seriously! It was nearly steak tartare on a bun (this isn‚Äôt a complaint, I absolutely love raw meat). But if you order your meat this way be prepared for a cool center."
ChIJ9RC9YBkpQg0RPL1JhDKMkzc,5,Sin duda la Mejor Hamburguesa de Madrid! Best Burger in Madrid hands down! With great service!! Call before to reserve!!!
ChIJfUIagAMpQg0RRYLx9K82nJc,4,"Overall experience was Impeccable‚ú®
Everything we ate was delicious and presented beautifully. First of, they give you a curated menu, some with pictures of each dish you‚Äôre going to have prior, so that you know what you‚Äôre eating next. The food had a combo of Asian and Spanish taste bud,
They also were very keen to our dietary restrictions +
we enjoyed everything! Considering it‚Äôs a 3 star Michelin restaurant by one of the best chefs in the world it was absolutely an experience worthy trying in Madrid.
The service was good and all the waiters spoke good English."
ChIJfUIagAMpQg0RRYLx9K82nJc,4,"Amazing presentations, impeccable attention to details down to the shoes of the waiters. Very nice ambiance and amazing flavours. The only problem I have is that the food is on par with most michelin restaurants I have visited , but the price is just not worth it. Same quality and bold flavour combinations you will get in many michelin star restaurants for half the price. 450 euros ( drinks not included) per person for the menu is not justified."
ChIJfUIagAMpQg0RRYLx9K82nJc,5,"Hands down the best meal and restaurant experience we‚Äôve ever had, everything was just perfect!

It‚Äôs hard to describe in words this amazing experience and beyond delicious food. Every single bite was just incredible- we spent the night looking at each other in disbelief, we just couldn‚Äôt believe the flavors, the elaborate work behind, the fabulous descriptions, the service and all the details.

I don‚Äôt love meat and asked for it to be skipped on my dishes and the alternatives I was given were just as elaborate and as beautiful and tasty as the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù menu.

We came in thinking that this was going to be something we would do once in a lifetime and left looking forward to repeating regularly. Definitely worth the Michelin stars and then some.

Dabiz, wow! üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèª"
ChIJfUIagAMpQg0RRYLx9K82nJc,5,"The dishes were flavourful and very playful.  I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the setting  just because it is difficult to get attention from service team but it does give a feel of privacy, and it does reflect the chara of the chef very well.  There were a lot of food but every dish was nicely explained throughout graphics and words which make the experience more enjoyable.  This is probably one of the more bold ones in terms of flavour and he did it superbly."
ChIJfUIagAMpQg0RRYLx9K82nJc,5,"African, Indian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc, nameless cuisine all merged well in different dishes.

The only thing is that English of waiters are not as well.

The meal is expensive as well yet to me it worth the price

All stories and techniques well illustrated. The chef is so original.

Wok is well used, adding extra flavour to the dishes."
ChIJp8gPSR8pQg0RvT2oZU4_wtM,5,"The truth is that it has had worse times, but lately I am very happy with the attention shown by both the waiters and the new manager.
I love the food, and although in spring/summer the terrace is incredible for dining especially, also now in winter and with how good the area is getting for going out, I find it a highly recommended place to have dinner and have the first drink. Normally we order a group menu which is well priced and you try a little of everything..."
ChIJp8gPSR8pQg0RvT2oZU4_wtM,4,"The best thing without a doubt is the terrace, very quiet despite the bustle of the area and with a very good atmosphere. The food, almost all portions, very good at an acceptable price. It is a good option for dinner and having the first drink chatting with your partner or friends. Yes, it is always better that you book, because if not you may have to wait a long time."
ChIJp8gPSR8pQg0RvT2oZU4_wtM,3,"El Escondite is one of those trendy restaurants that is worth trying... but just once. The prices are not at all adequate for the quantity they offer. The quality is good and the place is very cute. It is set in a black and white decoration and, if you can be on the terrace, even better. It gets packed on Friday and Saturday nights so I recommend going on a Thursday or Sunday."
ChIJp8gPSR8pQg0RvT2oZU4_wtM,3,"Restaurant in Alberto Alcocer with a young atmosphere and a very large terrace, ideal for a group of friends. Reservations are made so you make sure you don't run out of space in this trendy area lately.
I recommend taking dishes to share if there are many of them or taking the menu for two.
Of the starters, I liked the cheese balls and the quesadillas the most.
The portions are on the large side so it is better not to go overboard as the desserts are very worth it, especially the Maria cookie cake that is surprising."
ChIJp8gPSR8pQg0RvT2oZU4_wtM,4,"I recommend the Burgers, I think the best time to go to dinner is Summer (and if it is in August better due to the number of people left in Madrid) for its terrace.

The food and the place is very modern, the worst thing is the price.

Try to make a reservation, since without one you can end up waiting hours to be seated.

Greetings to everyone"
ChIJRZOQ2xgpQg0RGODGOU4e1yo,5,"One of the best restaurants that I have had the pleasure to visit. The food and the service are outstanding. The dishes are fresh, simple and tasty, in specific the huge tomatoes from the Pepa orrchard. The wine selection is very good and you get the professional advise from a local sommelier. Hugely recommended!"
ChIJRZOQ2xgpQg0RGODGOU4e1yo,5,"A very relaxed and enjoyable evening. Quality local produce served in generally fairly simple ways. The fresh tomatoes with burrata were delicious. The fried whiting was cut into large chunks and deep fried just enough to be cooked and was very fresh and delicate. The sirloin steak was cut into small cubes and served in an Asian style ginger, sesame, soy sauce, was very tender and meaty. Roasted artichoke was creamy. Only some of the staff spoke English but we managed, and they do have an English menu online but it seemed a little different than the Spanish version which was confusing. The only thing that was a little disappointing was soggy fries in a couple of dishes."
ChIJRZOQ2xgpQg0RGODGOU4e1yo,4,"Enjoy my stay and food here. Fresh tomato is must try here, octopus was also very good. Level of English low, therefore 4 stars. But communicative however"
ChIJRZOQ2xgpQg0RGODGOU4e1yo,4,I have been coming to this restaurant for many years since they first opened and today for the first time I was really disappointed we made our reservation several days before in person abd asked for the main room seating and when we arrived we were moved to the back room our view was of the espresso machine snd no ambiance followed by terrible service and since we ordered the monkfish they showed us the whole fish then by the time they separated the portions it was almost cold we then asked for mayonnaise olive oil and lemon 3x before we got it hence the fish was cold the fried potatoes came out 10 min before so they were cold by now as well we asked for a glass of water and we had to ask several times before it was served the desserts were overly sweet and the  Arroz con leche was very liquid as well disappointing the fish was fresh and cooked well and the gazpacho and other starters were very good but thats the only redeeming factor when we complained to the manager on our way out he said we should have called him but he never stopped by to see how we were ... Im sad and disappointed
ChIJRZOQ2xgpQg0RGODGOU4e1yo,5,One of the best options in Madrid right now. The kitchen is based on high-quality products and ingredients. Meat and fish are all fresh and the menu has many choices. We found the tuna and the sirloin excellent. The staff was very nice and attentive. An important thing was that the chef came over our table to check everything was ok and bought a couple of wine glasses for us... That's worth mentioning as it reflects that every detail is important for Pepa.
ChIJJ0DSOh8pQg0RR5NQ1eyd-Y8,5,"With a relaxed dining vibe and stunning presentation, the langostino is a must-try!"
ChIJJ0DSOh8pQg0RR5NQ1eyd-Y8,5,"It was an amazing atmosphere for a dinner out, the food was excellently delicious as well as the hospitality. I %100 recommend it."
ChIJJ0DSOh8pQg0RR5NQ1eyd-Y8,2,"The food that was good, was great. All food was fresh. Sushi and appetizers were great. Other than that, the food was terrible. Super small portions and horrible seasonings are combined with excessive prices for no reason. If you want something that looks like Japanese food but tastes absolutely nothing like it, this is your place. If you are just looking for nice people, good drinks, and no food, this is your place. Do not try the teppanyaki. It is not like anywhere else."
ChIJJ0DSOh8pQg0RR5NQ1eyd-Y8,5,"Absolutely love this restaurant! Best food, nice deco and great service. Very reasonable price too. We go often."
ChIJJ0DSOh8pQg0RR5NQ1eyd-Y8,4,"Nice and cozy place. Love the modern interior.
The food was great, service was excellent. Went there once, for dinner with group tour. We had teppanyaki table."
ChIJLWGeQhkpQg0RCEREqV9tnRU,5,"As someone else noted, bread and sausages are extra charges but I will still take them. The roll is crispy on the outside and light in the middle. Came out hot! Definitely try it. The sausages are wonderful too. If she didn't bring it out, I would have missed there Tony sausage. Delicious.

I had the bacalao for my main meal and the gazpacho with it. It's a lot to eat. Not only did it look pleasing, the tomato sauce under it is piping hot! And I love the julienned seasonal vegetables. Overall I recommend you try the Spanish food here."
ChIJLWGeQhkpQg0RCEREqV9tnRU,4,"Although it's on the pricy side, I would say that the experience was worth it. The dishes were excellent, without a single exception, while the beverages were also good. Although the staff didn't know English at all, after some Google Translate and some bad pronunciation, we were able to oder everything that we wanted. It's quite a shame that they don't know a word in English, but they were as helpful and nice as they could in this situation, so I won't deduct a star because of that, but you have to keep it in mind if you're a tourist. And one more thing, it's not nice to bring something to the table without asking and then charge you for it."
ChIJLWGeQhkpQg0RCEREqV9tnRU,5,"This restaurant deserves so much praise. Upon entering, I was warmly greeted by Gabriel who was so kind and made some excellent recommendations based on individual preferences. When told that I would like to experience the local cuisine, he took the time to explain which were some good options and why, what they contained and how they were made. The service was so smooth, personalized and overall an enjoyable experience. The food was excellent and the ambiance very pleasant. The restaurant is close to Cuzco metro station and offers 20% discount for airline crew. An absolute must try! Enjoy!"
ChIJLWGeQhkpQg0RCEREqV9tnRU,5,"This restaurant is a must if you like spanish food!
Is quite popular amongst locals,which means they are great at what they are doing.
They have different dishes that can be combined in a daily menu,so that you enjoy a bit of everything.
The sea bass, caesar salad and grilled artichokes have stuck with me since I first visited this place!
Totally recommend it"
ChIJLWGeQhkpQg0RCEREqV9tnRU,3,Atmosphere ok. Slight confusion when ordering but that was probably partly language barrier with my mediocre Spanish. Also charged extra for bread and sausages brought to the table without asking or notifying us of cost. Highlight was dessert
ChIJdamg2R4pQg0RZ9DmGIIEDIM,5,Amazing find!!  Everything was super fresh and very flavorful!!  The oysters were beautiful and perfection!!  The barnacles were definitely a high point.  I would come back to try other offerings!!
ChIJdamg2R4pQg0RZ9DmGIIEDIM,5,"It was a great restaurant. We both had the fish (different types) and it was amazing. Very tasty.
We were also verywell treated and the service was excellent."
ChIJdamg2R4pQg0RZ9DmGIIEDIM,5,Local people will probably kick me for revealing this but I‚Äôve not had a better meal in  Spain ever. Taste was really out of this world. Jamon and all the seafood was just magnificent. That is topped with amazing service. Wow!
ChIJdamg2R4pQg0RZ9DmGIIEDIM,3,The starter was more salty and oily than I am used to. The hake stuffed with crab was a little disappointing. The service staff was helpful to bring a iPad which showed pictures of the desserts when we were studying the menu. :)
ChIJdamg2R4pQg0RZ9DmGIIEDIM,4,"Went for a business dinner during a trip to madrid late winter.  Can only recomend the place if you are in for a serious dinner with serious food.
Everything we had was TOP:
haddock pintxo, pan seared sweatbreads, percebes, vieras, cocotxas.  Ribera del Duero house wine."
ChIJG9hl9xApQg0RBRqTfVu0jHo,5,"Food is so delicious, reasonable price in a very cozy atmosphere! Superb lechon Ala Madrid Spain. Special thanks to Pancho a very attentive server in providing a good service."
ChIJG9hl9xApQg0RBRqTfVu0jHo,5,"Today I'm going here with my husband and my kids, we really like the lamb, the meat is really soft and the skin is really crispy, for sure we will come back again! Is the best of the best lamb we ever taste in our life!"
ChIJG9hl9xApQg0RBRqTfVu0jHo,5,Rarely I have seen such a personal level of attention which was paid to me. Ordered their famous combo with Lamb. Excellent preparation with more than enough quantity for me. Highly recommended for visit.
ChIJG9hl9xApQg0RBRqTfVu0jHo,5,Very good food. We got a bunch of plates to the center and tried a lot of them. Exelent service and for the cuality of the food it is a good price. Juicy meet/10 will be back... soon.
ChIJG9hl9xApQg0RBRqTfVu0jHo,4,"One of the ""Asador"" reference sites in Madrid. Excelent service, good selection of meet, solid wine selection with some very well priced gems. Good overall experience and recommended."
ChIJbwYkOh8pQg0R04Fg4JKBw0g,5,"family owned, extremely friendly people. we were 7 and served in no time with great care. Food is simply incomparable, fish were made super tasty, steak exactly to our suggestion. highly recommend."
ChIJbwYkOh8pQg0R04Fg4JKBw0g,5,"In love with this restaurant!!! Traditional and not very modern atmosphere, but it doesn‚Äôt lose any sleep... food is AMAZING! All the dishes are top ranked, definitely I‚Äôll repeat!"
ChIJbwYkOh8pQg0R04Fg4JKBw0g,5,Cute terraced restaurant with homey but really well executed dishes and great service. Came here for dinner and had to come back the next week because I couldn‚Äôt get the salpic√≥n out of my head!
ChIJbwYkOh8pQg0R04Fg4JKBw0g,5,"Unpretentious yet elegant. The terrace for a summer night is a must. Food was simple and absolutely delicious. Tomatoes are a must, sweet and fresh."
ChIJbwYkOh8pQg0R04Fg4JKBw0g,5,"Excellent food in a cozy ambience, completely family run restaurant. Service was great and they were extremely helpful despite some language barrier since we do not speak Spanish."
ChIJYUghHxkpQg0RLPuxInpbo1E,5,"Well, a great restaurant where you know you can find real & authentical food from Spain. Most of the people there were locals who are frecuent customers.
Customer service was exceptional and I left whit the intentions to come back in my next visit to this amazing city."
ChIJYUghHxkpQg0RLPuxInpbo1E,5,"Very good foods, you have to try solomillo de buey con foie, it's very tasty. Very nice and good services. Un 10!!‚Äã"
ChIJYUghHxkpQg0RLPuxInpbo1E,5,Traditional Spanish food. Tasty and good service. I can recommend.
ChIJYUghHxkpQg0RLPuxInpbo1E,5,Great food for a slightly higher price but totally worth it. Went there late at night right before they closed and were able to sit us down. Great wine as well.
ChIJYUghHxkpQg0RLPuxInpbo1E,5,"Great food and great service, a great choice if you are ever around!"
ChIJLe1MiBkpQg0RaEX0n3DCmKs,4,"We really enjoyed our gambas Al ajillo and pimientos de padr√≥n con jam√≥n. The ham was delicately placed over roasted, salted padr√≥n peppers. The Shrimp were soaking in a garlicky, glorious, hot olive oil bath. They are more expense (around 20 euro each) than a fried calamari or a patata bravas that you could get for half the price , but worth it for the quality of the food. Our waiter seemed a bit distracted despite us being one of the only customers at the early hour we ate. He seemed to think we weren‚Äôt ordering enough, but we really came just for tapas and not a full meal."
ChIJLe1MiBkpQg0RaEX0n3DCmKs,5,"The waiters were incredibly friendly, and the food was delicious‚Äîespecially the cachopo with fries. We had a great experience!"
ChIJLe1MiBkpQg0RaEX0n3DCmKs,5,"Great place for a meal, especially outside with the cooling mist spray for hot summer evenings. The gratis crab salad is a nice opener, and the crab croquetas are awesome, but this is an Asturian locale so the hot stone cooked chuleton is the main attraction. It does not disappoint, arriving just plopped on the stone, raw to rare, with nothing but salt shavings.

Good enough to tussle grandad‚Äôs remaining hair."
ChIJLe1MiBkpQg0RaEX0n3DCmKs,5,"Manolo is an excellent service he made our day ask for him!!! is cook to call before for reserve

The food was amazing, the fabada was good and the rice pudding!!"
ChIJLe1MiBkpQg0RaEX0n3DCmKs,5,"We enjoyed a very delicious lunch here. We ordered the mejillones, the huevos revueltos, setas and pulpo to start, then we ordered the merluza and cachopo for the main dish. Absolutely delicious!"
ChIJO7uqEBopQg0RTCVZJZOPHS4,5,"Just had lunch here. Excellent food, exquisite service, great place. Highly recommend!"
ChIJO7uqEBopQg0RTCVZJZOPHS4,5,Great place to have lunch. Menu of the day is always various and delicious. Nice price-quality match.
ChIJO7uqEBopQg0RTCVZJZOPHS4,5,"We were eating dinner there last night , I think the meat cooked excellent .we liked it ,salad was very good too, waiters were very good ..
I will go there later for testing other food ....
I love there"
ChIJO7uqEBopQg0RTCVZJZOPHS4,3,"Decent value for money if you're looking for an economic lunch, especially for a weekend (15‚Ç¨ menu del d√≠a). Lots of choice, but better quality alternatives elsewhere."
ChIJO7uqEBopQg0RTCVZJZOPHS4,4,The food is good  and they have a surprising selection of lots of different rums! Also there is usually the possibility to have the selection of the day cocktail at a cheaper price.
ChIJ6XXuGhopQg0RGRwc22DjgRg,5,Excellent food and amazing place with pleasant and refined details while being very modern at the same time! The waiters make an effort to speak english and to understand you too but you really have to know some basics and know what to order in Spanish in order to survive! We had an amazing night and I will definitely go there again when I fly to Madrid next time!
ChIJ6XXuGhopQg0RGRwc22DjgRg,5,"What a wonderful experience. Best Argentinian beef in Madrid. Service was top notch, our server Oscar was super friendly and informative. He was patient and provided my wife and I with excellent service. We received many complimentary items such as desserts and drinks. Very impressed with this place, highly recommended.
Thank you Oscar! You made our Madrid getaway even more special."
ChIJ6XXuGhopQg0RGRwc22DjgRg,5,"One of my favorite restaurants in Madrid. I dine there at least once every visit. Friendly staff, wonderful food, great wine selection. and a beautiful atmosphere make dining there something special anytime.  I highly recommend De Maria. They will exceed your expectations."
ChIJ6XXuGhopQg0RGRwc22DjgRg,4,"I have been here and to the other ones several times, my experience has always been excellent, however the one at Felix Boix yesterday was pretty average as they were busy and could not attend properly. I asked for my stake to be done in a certain way and it was completely ignored by the staff...
Even the quality was mediocre which is extremely rare at De Mar√≠a especially given the price you pay..."
ChIJ6XXuGhopQg0RGRwc22DjgRg,1,"Food is not bad, however service is terrible, they charge $20 for bread you dont even order.  So many other great options in this area to eat and experience better service.

Would NOT recommend."
ChIJ9RC9YBkpQg0RruaSQUvhgDI,5,"Our visit to Restaurante Sacha in Madrid was nothing short of extraordinary, thanks to a recommendation from a chef friend. We were welcomed personally by Sacha himself, who is as warm and charismatic as the stories suggest. Without a formal menu in hand, he asked about our likes and dislikes and curated a personalized tasting menu paired with outstanding wines.

Each dish was a masterpiece, but the standout was the sardine‚Äîunlike anything I‚Äôve ever had. The Falsa Lasa√±a de Txangurro was also a revelation, with perfectly balanced flavors that left us speechless. The service, ambiance, and, most importantly, the food exceeded all expectations.

I wholeheartedly encourage anyone visiting Madrid to experience Sacha. You won‚Äôt be disappointed, and, like us, you may find yourself with a new favorite restaurant in the city."
ChIJ9RC9YBkpQg0RruaSQUvhgDI,5,"Quaint restaurant inside a garden in the middle of the block. Once inside you feel like you‚Äôve stepped back in time. The service is very professional and the table is pristine. After we ordered our food. We looked around us and absorbed the history on the walls and decorations. The food came 15 mins later and we all enjoyed all the plates. The soft omelette was easily one of the best we‚Äôve had in Madrid. The steak was really good too. Lamb chops, fish with prawns, garlic soup, and ravioli was good. Overall this was one of best lunches in Madrid as we were fortunate to get reservations. Don‚Äôt skip on this restaurant."
ChIJ9RC9YBkpQg0RruaSQUvhgDI,5,"We took a 30 minute Uber ride to dine here and what a great decision.  Clearly we were dining in a restaurant where everyone knew everyone.  It was a little tricky to find, since it's on the first floor of an apartment building, but it was worth the effort on a rainy night.  The food is superb.  The menu is in Spanish, but they were nice enough to help us translate when Google failed us."
ChIJ9RC9YBkpQg0RruaSQUvhgDI,5,"10/10 meal!

We had the False Lasagna, fried artichokes, omelet with blood sausage, lamb chops and the sting ray. Everything was insanely good.

Really appreciated that the servers and kitchen adjusted the portions for sharing. We were a group of three and they split everything before hand so we were served our own plates of everything.

A little out of the way as we were staying in Barrio Salamanca but totally worth it."
ChIJ9RC9YBkpQg0RruaSQUvhgDI,5,"What a truly incredible dining experience! The staff and service are very attentive and top notch and the food was beyond excellent. We were able to get a lunch time reservation and enjoyed the omelette, entrecotte, and stingray. They were all delicious but the omelette and stingray were the star of the show. The omelette was perfectly cooked (just barely set) and the crispy potatoes balanced perfectly with the blood sausage and peppers, while the stingray was tender, rich, and so flavorful.

The menu was only in Spanish but between some basic translating, reading other reviews, and some great suggestions from the staff we put together a great little menu. We‚Äôll absolutely have to return on the next trip to Madrid!"
ChIJWyAnHBEpQg0R4fRzobQH7iw,4,"A great little place to get yourself a to go sandwich. I only stopped in for a minute to pick up one of the cheese sandwiches which was recommended to me. It was exactly what I needed at that point, a nice, quick snack after walking around all day. There‚Äôs a few spots around Madrid, so if you come by one don‚Äôt hesitate to come in and try it out, it has an old Madrid feel to it as well. It‚Äôs cheap and good, you won‚Äôt go wrong here."
ChIJWyAnHBEpQg0R4fRzobQH7iw,5,"I had dark chocolate cappuccino and dark chocolate taza pequeno‚Ä¶ they are so tasty and yummy.. highly recommended

Drank it to give a fair review üëçüèº"
ChIJWyAnHBEpQg0R4fRzobQH7iw,5,"Amazing coffee, and staff. It‚Äôs a good environment to use laptops, however the internet is slow, and sometimes not working."
ChIJWyAnHBEpQg0R4fRzobQH7iw,3,"They don't pick the dishes from the tables, at least when I went it felt pretty McDonald's-like.

The sandwiches are too small for the price. Please consider coming here. It's good for a date tho."
ChIJWyAnHBEpQg0R4fRzobQH7iw,4,"It was a good experience to stop at Rodilla in Plaza Castellana, next to our hotel. I went there for breakfast on Christmas day, everything was good, coffee and pastries. Friendly staff and customers as well. I like it that it was open on Christmas day. Thanks!"
ChIJRyCU8RkpQg0RFOEoC32xt-M,5,"Lovely place with great hamburgers!
I really love the decoration and seems it is 30 years like this!
I tried Nati Burger especial and Mexican Burgers which were delicious and so big portions, as starter I enjoyed the Buffalo wings.
They have various beers as well.
About staffs I should say they are so nice üòä
Consider the place has terrace as well."
ChIJRyCU8RkpQg0RFOEoC32xt-M,5,Wonderful place!!! Everyone should come here to have a hamburger!!! It was amazing and the service was top notch
ChIJRyCU8RkpQg0RFOEoC32xt-M,5,"Had been visiting this place since late 70¬¥s , when there were not many choices to eat real hamburgers in Madrid and in the neighborhood. Since then it was a great place to meet for beers in the hood and the best hamburgers in Madrid. The staff had been the same  forever and always friendly as Pedro the front barman.  Recently new owners started running the place,  and it was  hard to beat the old traditional hamburguers and hot dogs, but they  did it.  Now the bar inside has more light and they opened  a much bigger terrace. Even that is in north side of Madrid, it is worthy to go there and enjoy it ."
ChIJRyCU8RkpQg0RFOEoC32xt-M,5,The burgers are fantastic here! We got the Nait burger and did not disappoint! Fun vibes and super nice waiters!
ChIJRyCU8RkpQg0RFOEoC32xt-M,3,"Nice place. Meat is OK. Lots of burgers, but you really depend on the sauce which essentially kills the taste of the burger per se. Good for children and informal meetings with friends. Good service"
ChIJV-5PKhkpQg0R5hiZ5y4XLU8,5,"Quality has a price guys‚Ä¶

If you‚Äôre thinking you are going to get away without paying for it, you better go to a Burger King‚Ä¶ Guys, this quality doesn‚Äôt happen often. This place has the fresh, most delicious sea food and fish you can get around the city. The selection is carefully taken care of to deliver first class products on your table. And that has a price. I don‚Äôt get some of the reviews here complaining about the price. You pay for what you get. And you get the best products. Less is more here. There‚Äôs no fancy sauces hiding the lack of flavor that you get in other places. It‚Äôs basic products with the full flavor and some olive oil that accentuates the original flavor of the food. Nothing more needed.
Will be back, totally recommended and totally deserves 5 star review."
ChIJV-5PKhkpQg0R5hiZ5y4XLU8,2,Unfortunately slow and the staff was not attentive even though our party arrived early and there were not a lot of people. The white wine was not properly chilled by time we got our appetizer and entrees. The food was good and the place is nice. If they would care for a better service it would be better. I guess they are famous enough to care.
ChIJV-5PKhkpQg0R5hiZ5y4XLU8,4,Worthy for a date dinner
ChIJV-5PKhkpQg0R5hiZ5y4XLU8,5,"Fantastic seafood and meat options.
Great service and reasonable prices for the quality.
Staff are multi lingual and patient with those with specific dietary needs
Excellent wine selection"
ChIJV-5PKhkpQg0R5hiZ5y4XLU8,5,"Very nice restaurant. The food were amazing. Super delicious. We sat inside for lunch and the ambience is very nice, good service.

Will come back."
ChIJ06p3WBApQg0RurAcbra13o0,5,This is the best place if you want to drink some cold ones in a budget. The food is also good for the price.
ChIJ06p3WBApQg0RurAcbra13o0,4,"Great place for a casual, cheap breakfast especially on a Sunday when most cafes are shut. Two cortados and two tostados for 5 euros. Filled with south americans going to the local market so had a lively and froendly atmosphere."
ChIJ06p3WBApQg0RurAcbra13o0,3,"Service was quick. This is definitely fast-food.

Food was not great at all, even though I ordered twice. Quality of most of the ingredients were okay (except for the salmon that was really good with the cheese). Cheese on top of fries seemed atificial. Chicken wings came out cold and tasted so-so.

I don't recommend the Sangria at all.

Guess it was overall okay for the cheap prices. Definitely better than McDonalds!

They need to work on the cleanliness and sanitation. This place has lots of traffic and seems pretty dirty after most people eat.

View of the Torres Kio was super nice outside! This saved the experience! The only thing is that there were homeless people asking you for money or food. Was pretty uncomfortable."
ChIJ06p3WBApQg0RurAcbra13o0,5,"Don't go here if you don't want to get drunk, beer is too cheap and good"
ChIJ06p3WBApQg0RurAcbra13o0,4,Cheap snacks and beverages. Good for a quick beer in the evening.
ChIJIfhoQxApQg0Re_ViEiQpf_U,5,The burger and the potatoes was delicious üôÇü•∞üòé
ChIJIfhoQxApQg0Re_ViEiQpf_U,4,"Everything was good, taste customer service, the guy at the counter explained everything to me in english and replaced my non alcoholic beer with normal beer which i had originally wanted but made a mistake while ordering. The only thing that i am not satisfied with is the food portion."
ChIJIfhoQxApQg0Re_ViEiQpf_U,1,"Please Use a GLOVES when preparing a food. .   It's disgusting seeing a staff preparing your order (burger) just using her hands without any gloves. , you don't know if it's clean or not. .  üôÑ"
ChIJIfhoQxApQg0Re_ViEiQpf_U,5,"Offers all the food, services, and prices expected of a Burger King. I have visited multiple times and service was reasonably quick even during busy hours. The inside has adequate seating and a comfortable atmosphere."
ChIJIfhoQxApQg0Re_ViEiQpf_U,5,Was amazing food in the place and also the service
ChIJyduziRkpQg0RHPRZoJF3bxY,5,"Very professional service. Waiters were attentive and friendly.
The food was delicious, very good quality and everything was well prepared."
ChIJyduziRkpQg0RHPRZoJF3bxY,5,"Best Asturian restaurant in madrid by far ,
The terrace it‚Äôs very comfortable.
The owner it‚Äôs always there checking that everything it‚Äôs great"
ChIJyduziRkpQg0RHPRZoJF3bxY,5,"Asturian Quality Restaurant. probably the best Rice Pudding I have ever had, Cachopo was delicious. Unbeatable service and pleasant ambient gives you a perfect meal."
ChIJyduziRkpQg0RHPRZoJF3bxY,5,"Great place for lunch! Elegant, vegan friendly, heated terrace... we enjoyed ourselves here."
ChIJyduziRkpQg0RHPRZoJF3bxY,4,Excellent food and wine selection. The grilled asparagus was spectacular and a presentation that I'd never had before. Also had fresh tomato salad and asparagus. Tremendous. A lovely pinot noir cava was very tasty. One entree that was not fantastic was their cordon bleu. Otherwise the service and the atmosphere very nice other than the old school jazz playing in the background.
ChIJRxLcG3AoQg0RvV57_UAOKX0,1,A shame of a place. This is food for 6 people. ‚Ç¨35 each. The cost included a limousine ride that never took place. The reservation was made for a specific time where we were never informed of the dinner times. Upon arrival they inform us that there is no longer kitchen service and therefore we cannot dine. TERRIBLE PLACE. TERRIBLE SERVICE FOR THE PROFIT. You have to have a lot of nerve to charge what they charge for such a shameful service.
ChIJRxLcG3AoQg0RvV57_UAOKX0,5,"I had been to this legendary restaurant many years ago. I thought the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãphones at the tables was super fun and this time I had a great time talking with my friends and those I didn't know. Although I have to say that they have improved in the performances, the chichiliders are great, I laughed like I hadn't in a long time. And the food, after all, we went to dinner, does not detract from the whole. Adequate quantities and very high quality. The prices are very good for the type of restaurant. I will repeat for sure!!!"
ChIJRxLcG3AoQg0RvV57_UAOKX0,5,"It is an incredible place, you have to book before going because it is usually always full. Their food is Mexican and it has something very original and that is that each table has a telephone with which you can communicate with any table. You will have a great time especially if you go with friends, for a bachelor/ette party, a party. Laughter is guaranteed and who knows, maybe something will come up between calls. There is also some show during dinners. I recommend it 100%"
ChIJRxLcG3AoQg0RvV57_UAOKX0,1,"A horrible bachelorette party, suffocating heat, terrible food, I don't recommend it to anyone.
Bad organization. I'm not repeating or crazy. The performances are very very shabby. One of the dinners going on at the premises.
They take you down to eat the ""body"" of one of the actors from a plate in a room that looks like a very shabby dentist.
So it is normal for them to earn money.
For what they give it's not worth it. Very bad and hot beer."
ChIJRxLcG3AoQg0RvV57_UAOKX0,5,"I went repeatedly because I loved the show they gave during the entire dinner. They made you get involved in every part of the show!!!! It was very cool!! The artists are called Chichileaders, even once dinner was over the entire restaurant participated!!! I had a great time, I laughed a lot and above all I would repeat and I'm telling you, I did repeat! 100% recommended."
ChIJpRPksxkpQg0RPNjuphNasFk,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at El CACIQUITO in Madrid, and I must say it was an unforgettable experience. Located in the heart of the city, this cozy restaurant serves up some of the most delicious and authentic Spanish cuisine I've ever had the pleasure of trying.

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere, complete with traditional Spanish decor and a lively ambiance. The service was top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff who were happy to answer any questions I had about the menu.

But the real star of the show was the food - oh, the food! I ordered the **Pollo al Ajillo** (garlic chicken) and it was cooked to perfection. The flavors were bold and rich, with just the right amount of spice to leave me wanting more. I also tried the **Patatas Bravas**, which were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, with a tangy sauce that added just the right amount of kick.

If you're looking for a truly authentic Spanish dining experience, look no further than El CACIQUITO. With its delicious food, warm atmosphere, and top-notch service, it's a must-visit destination for anyone traveling to Madrid."
ChIJpRPksxkpQg0RPNjuphNasFk,5,Delicious entrees expertly prepared. Exquisite service that perfectly paces the dining experience so that you don‚Äôt ever feel rushed. A wonderful place to bring clients for entertaining.
ChIJpRPksxkpQg0RPNjuphNasFk,5,"Relaxed atmosphere with nice interior decorations and lively bar. Delicious food with Argentinian style grill. We shared canilones, ceviche and carillera and everything was really good. The service was quick and attentive. We finished with the Tiramisu that was fantastic."
ChIJpRPksxkpQg0RPNjuphNasFk,5,Had 4 nice beers and dinner. Burger was good not great. Very chill atmosphere sitting outside.
ChIJpRPksxkpQg0RPNjuphNasFk,1,"One of the worst restaurant experiences. My whole family all ordered steaks and we asked for medium, they were all fully well done. when we asked for new steaks they messed it up once again giving it fully rare. The waiter and the manager were extremely rude and completely unapologetic. They even begin shouting in Spanish. Absolutely horrible experience would definitely skip coming here."
ChIJk-C1HSQpQg0R4HGNBn2T1kg,5,Local hidden gem! Delicious food and amazing service
ChIJk-C1HSQpQg0R4HGNBn2T1kg,5,Seafood is really good and very nice atmosphere üëåüèª
ChIJk-C1HSQpQg0R4HGNBn2T1kg,5,"I came to this restaurant back in October when I had a layover between flights looking for some quick, but delicious food.  I was so beyond delighted, not by how fresh and good the meal was, but how kind and generous the staff was.  I do not speak one work of spanish, but the owner and staff went out of their way to help me through the menu and bring me a variety of dishes (many that I didn't even order), just to make me feel at home.  It was such a memorable experience, and I am so grateful that for my first visit to Spain (even it it was only for 3 hours) I was greeted with so much kindness."
ChIJk-C1HSQpQg0R4HGNBn2T1kg,5,"The main reason for visiting this place is sea food. Its fresh and well prepared. The menu offers fish, shellfish and crabs, but they do have a meat section. Starters can be both meat (with great jamon) or fish (its probably best to go for mixed plate, you will get to taste the most). The waiters are not fluent in English, but they will give you the menu in English and do their best to serve you. The interior is not really a design artwork, but you will feel cosy and nice."
ChIJk-C1HSQpQg0R4HGNBn2T1kg,5,"For the first time in my life I tried paella, wonderful experience very delicious food and service of the waiters at the highest level, I highly recommend this restaurant"
ChIJzY-4Mi4pQg0RhSy_plM6928,5,"Great local restaurante madrile√±o with a over 50 year history. Both owners are still present. Very attentive service. Famous for their ensalada rusa and the paella. Make sure you have a reserva. Busy place for lunch. 3 people having 2 starters, paella for 2, drinks and coffee for ‚Ç¨115,- is ok Price."
ChIJzY-4Mi4pQg0RhSy_plM6928,5,"This was the best paella I ever had in Madrid, and this is my third trip to this beautiful city. You know that you are not great restaurant when  most of the customers are locals who knows good/topical food. The customer service was exceptional. For sure I will be back to try another paella."
ChIJzY-4Mi4pQg0RhSy_plM6928,5,"Amazing arroz (paella) in Madrid.

From the moment I arrived, the service was truly the very best.
Special shoutout to Jose and Andrea, along with the rest of the amazing team ‚Äì they went above and beyond and made me feel genuinely special.

The atmosphere is authentic, filled with locals ‚Äì always a good sign. It‚Äôs away from the touristy area.
Reservations are a must, and now I understand why.

And the food? One of the best paellas I‚Äôve had in Madrid ‚Äì maybe even in all of Spain.
This restaurant specializes in arroces (rice). Amazing socarrat.

Can‚Äôt wait to return. Highly recommended!"
ChIJzY-4Mi4pQg0RhSy_plM6928,5,"Samm is a truly extraordinary place, by the locals for the locals, since many years, quite outside of city center.

It is all about Paellas, the best of the best, served with kindness and passion in a very pleasant and vibrant atmosphere!

One of those few restaurants i'm constantly dreaming to go back to üòãü•∞üëè"
ChIJzY-4Mi4pQg0RhSy_plM6928,5,"The paella senyoret had the best socarrat.
Service was great. Setting is good for family gatherings on a weekend. Will be sure to visit this place again when we return to Madrid"
ChIJtX2O-TopQg0RwbzxSQ5Zvxo,3,"The rooms are clean and have everything really necessary, but the interior looks like it was made from materials found in a landfill. They look like the nightmare of an architect who read a book about upcycling before bedtime.
The staff is very friendly and helpful though. But you have to speak Spanish to talk to them.
You can reach everything easily from there since you have buses and Metro close by."
ChIJtX2O-TopQg0RwbzxSQ5Zvxo,5,"Other reviews have been really down on this place, but I'd like to reverse that trend if possible.  We stayed here for one night when we arrived late into Madrid, and we had an early-morning train out of Chamartin (ten minutes walk) the next morning.  It's also a five-minute walk from the north exit of Pio XII metro station.  For our needs it was perfect - small and basic for sure, but clean with comfortable beds, and all plumbing worked well - including the shower which had great pressure and temperature.  My advice would be not to stay here if you need a lot of space or luxury, because you simply won't get those here.  But if you need something basically decent, convenient to transport, and way more affordable than most places in Madrid these days, then this is your spot.  Pleasant and friendly receptionist at check-in as well."
ChIJtX2O-TopQg0RwbzxSQ5Zvxo,2,"Rooms are ugly, the bed is not comfortable. The only good thing about the hotel is the location. You get transport easy"
ChIJtX2O-TopQg0RwbzxSQ5Zvxo,5,I was very happy with my stay at this hotel. All of the staff were friendly and very accommodating. I stayed in this hotel a week while in Spain and would choose it again.
ChIJtX2O-TopQg0RwbzxSQ5Zvxo,4,"Ideal location, very good price, room comfortable."

ChIJ16OuLyEpQg0R6C9nh383Qf0,1,"I reserved a kettle by phone and I went to pick it up the next day...they didn't have it, they had sold it... Luckily, in the same market I found the Hnos G√≥mez chicken shop and I was able to buy it there. A shame, very good website and positioning but the service in my case was bad."
ChIJ16OuLyEpQg0R6C9nh383Qf0,1,"I've been calling the phone for 3 days and they don't pick up, in fact they hang up on you, they should have a little decency and answer the phone, even if it's to say that they don't want to make orders.
I don't give you a 0 because it doesn't stop, but that's where your business goes down."
ChIJ16OuLyEpQg0R6C9nh383Qf0,5,We bought a 6kg turkey. for thanksgiving and it turned out great. Shipping was very fast. I recommend it
ChIJ16OuLyEpQg0R6C9nh383Qf0,5,"What incredible service and quality.  Within a couple of hours the products were on their way via refrigerated transport and arrived in perfect condition.  I wasted days searching locally with no luck.  I recommend everyone to contact ""the foie corner"" if you need anything, and don't waste your time elsewhere"
ChIJRVusRCEpQg0R3oIpSRRSa-w,5,Surprisingly the food is nice. We love the oxtail dish. Nice teraza area for chill with friends. I think the place need extra staff during busy time.
ChIJRVusRCEpQg0R3oIpSRRSa-w,4,"Great sandwich with Jamon Iberico along with a good beer. Ordering would be more easy if they could have an english menu for tourists, but the food was good in overall. The olives from the house were also very tasty"
ChIJRVusRCEpQg0R3oIpSRRSa-w,5,"Extremely friendly, English menu is a big plus, authentic food. When I came the second time the beer and welcome tapas were brought in less then a minute ;)"
ChIJRVusRCEpQg0R3oIpSRRSa-w,4,Excelent prices for kind of fast food. Kind and nice serving.
ChIJRVusRCEpQg0R3oIpSRRSa-w,4,Good products and service
ChIJ1QymnyEpQg0RqS3iBPK0IMQ,5,"There is nothing quite as opulent as a long lunch. Dinners are all well and good, but lunch‚Äîproper lunch‚Äînow that‚Äôs the real indulgence. The kind that stretches into the afternoon, where the wine keeps flowing, the conversation sparkles, and the food, ideally, makes you wonder why you‚Äôd ever eat anywhere else. Nuevo Gerardo is exactly that kind of place.

From the moment you walk in, you know you‚Äôre in for something special. The seafood is proudly displayed on ice‚Äîgleaming, fresh, as if it had just leapt from the ocean and onto the counter. The room is sumptuous yet effortlessly welcoming, all polished wood, crisp white tablecloths, and that unmistakable hum of contented diners who know they‚Äôve made the right choice. Sunlight streams through the windows. The waiters, seasoned professionals with the kind of charm that can‚Äôt be taught, glide between tables, ensuring glasses are never empty and nothing is ever rushed.

And then there‚Äôs the food‚Äîethereal, on another plane entirely. The prawns are so sweet and fresh you‚Äôd swear the sea was lapping at the doorstep rather than hours away. The jam√≥n ib√©rico is the sort of thing that makes you briefly consider moving to Spain, just so you can eat it daily without judgement. And then comes the lobster paella‚Äîa golden, glistening masterpiece, the kind of dish that makes you want to weep for all the substandard rice-based atrocities you‚Äôve eaten before.

The year has only just begun, but if I have a better lunch than this, I‚Äôll be a very lucky man. If you‚Äôre in Madrid and want to ruin all future meals, come here‚Äîbecause after Nuevo Gerardo, nothing else will ever measure up."
ChIJ1QymnyEpQg0RqS3iBPK0IMQ,5,"The place is great, from decoration to delicious food. We loved the ‚Äúarroz negro‚Äù and the ‚Äúpulpo a la brasa‚Äù, but everything we tasted was really good.

Also the staff is really professional and helpful."
ChIJ1QymnyEpQg0RqS3iBPK0IMQ,5,Fantastic fish restaurant. Everything was perfect!
ChIJ1QymnyEpQg0RqS3iBPK0IMQ,2,"Good food and paella, but was a biter sweet experience! shrimps super expensive and the lack of clarity from the waiter was really awkward at the end.. we paid for a dozens of shrimps (12 gambas)125‚Ç¨. If you ask for a starter plate at least explain to the customer how much its going to paid."
ChIJ1QymnyEpQg0RqS3iBPK0IMQ,5,Nice place. Great food!
ChIJeb67liEpQg0RenPtp7FnmS4,5,Mina was a great host! And food was delicious.
ChIJeb67liEpQg0RenPtp7FnmS4,5,"I stopped here for something to eat and was very impressed; so many delicious options to choose from. While it is a little pricey, you get what you pay for here. Often ""gourmet"" burgers might be tasty, but they are usually dripping with fat; these were deliciously moist without being messy to eat. The only negative is the roadside location, but I appreciate this isn't a quick fix."
ChIJeb67liEpQg0RenPtp7FnmS4,5,"The Restaurant let us very late Inside, so WE can eat in calm, was very very good!
Thank you!

10/5 Stars"
ChIJeb67liEpQg0RenPtp7FnmS4,5,"Just incredible. Food and service. A must go. Needing somewhere to eat nearby and looking at reviews headed to the restaurant, it was super busy the guy was super friendly and offered outside with a heater on to keep warm and wait for a table, as soon as a table was available the guy got us inside to keep us from the cold while they got the table ready, after sitting it felt like the food came instantly and it was incredible, one of the best burgers I have ever had. I have travelled a lot and this is a good one. Deffo worth a try. We randomly looked for it so make a reservation as we found out after they are always busy and from the food, there is no surprises for that so book a reservation and just let the tastes buds go wild."
ChIJeb67liEpQg0RenPtp7FnmS4,3,"I‚Äôve been eating at Goiko for a few years - every time I visit Spain. It‚Äôs being my favorite burger place for a long time.

Unfortunately, the burger I ate today - a year since the last one I‚Äôve had - was not as good as other years. They seem to be reducing the portion of the meat and other ingredients to save in costs, resulting in a lower quality product. Take a look at the picture of the burger I got - the bread was way big for the meat, and overall looked unappetizing.

Unsure if this happens as the result of change in ownership, or if it‚Äôs an anomaly from this specific location. I‚Äôll miss the good old Goiko üò¢"
ChIJkQyN8iEpQg0RRUdt0edYMxo,4,"Update: on my second visit this location was much cleaner. They outside patio seems to be sometimes enclosed and sometimes open. There are ceiling fans to help keep you cool.

It's McDonald's what are you expecting?

I think the burgers are a little worse than in North America. Probably healthier, but also less tasty. However, you can order a beer with your meal unlike in North America, so that makes up for most of it.

The seating area accessible through the restaurant was nice - outdoors but covered. The seating area by the sidewalk was a disaster with garbage and trays everywhere.  There is no air conditioned indoor seating.

There are kiosks for ordering if you're not confident in your Spanish."
ChIJkQyN8iEpQg0RRUdt0edYMxo,4,"Wonderful staff , limited menu selection , no fillet-o-fish on offer . Incredible service and excellent seating. Probably the cleanest macdonalds I‚Äôve ever been to ."
ChIJkQyN8iEpQg0RRUdt0edYMxo,1,"I ordered from them in Glovo and just send me the drinks, two menus missing, they failed to put then in a paper bag, they need to be checked out."
ChIJkQyN8iEpQg0RRUdt0edYMxo,1,"In the menu there's not fish, there's not onion ring, in the bathroom there's not paper and it's all dirty! Bad experience."
ChIJkQyN8iEpQg0RRUdt0edYMxo,4,"Food amazing and fresh! Staff a bit rude. They didn't let us dine inside, even though it was raining outside."
ChIJ3TvKrSYpQg0RGPpWSl3Tahg,5,"Great local cafe, low prices, cozy interior. Decent croissants and good coffee"
ChIJ3TvKrSYpQg0RGPpWSl3Tahg,2,"Place is fine, generally quiet. Same nice sandwiches and in other locations. But they have now blocked all electric plugs, no way to charge phone or computer, que a cheap attitude."
ChIJ3TvKrSYpQg0RGPpWSl3Tahg,5,"Good place to take fresh sandwiches!!!!!
You should go there!!!"
ChIJ3TvKrSYpQg0RGPpWSl3Tahg,4,ok
ChIJ3TvKrSYpQg0RGPpWSl3Tahg,5,Great croissants
ChIJ16OuLyEpQg0RpaSMioFdq8M,5,"Enjoyed a wonderful meal with excellent service by the owner.  Made us feel very welcome with an appetizer of burrata & tomatoes, truffle mortadella & a lovely margherita pizza.  Wine was fabulous as well.  Wish it wasn‚Äôt our last night in Madrid!  Thank you!"
ChIJ16OuLyEpQg0RpaSMioFdq8M,5,Been a client for many years now. Great Italian home made pasta and desserts. The owners run the place and are the most kind type of people. You can have your meal there or buy the pasta and sauces to cook at home. The four cheese sauce and the tiramisu are amazing!
ChIJ16OuLyEpQg0RpaSMioFdq8M,5,"Fresh, authentic, delicious food. Lasagna was good size and delicious! Very friendly owner."
ChIJ16OuLyEpQg0RpaSMioFdq8M,5,Incredible Italian food! Can‚Äôt wait to go back :)
ChIJ16OuLyEpQg0RpaSMioFdq8M,5,Reasonable prices and great pasta in the middle of the market. I would highly recommend!
ChIJx6OuLyEpQg0Rr3VvqNs0dFY,3,"Store specialized in gourmet products, specializing in the typical Santa Teresa yolks from √Åvila or quince sweets.

They have a bar and tables to have a drink there. I haven't innovated much and I've ordered coffee with milk and toast with tomato. Delicious product but they charged me ‚Ç¨3.40 and it seems excessive to me.

Maybe I would return for a quince paste-type treat that I review on our breakfast website, but I will explore other cheaper options for breakfast in the Market."
ChIJx6OuLyEpQg0Rr3VvqNs0dFY,5,Everything is great. I will return
ChIJx6OuLyEpQg0Rr3VvqNs0dFY,5,
ChIJPf3o0SYpQg0R6nmL6nmIDeQ,1,The waitress was really great - but everything else was just terrible. Ordered 2 bbq ribs and a whole chicken meal for our group of 5. The chicken came and it was just not done - at all - RAW - the chicken legs were pink. We sent that back and changed the order to ribs for everyone - the first 2 were finished by the time the other ribs came - pale looking slathered with bbq sauce on top - cold in the middle - the grilled corn sides - completely cold all 3 of them - terrible experience and waste of money!
ChIJPf3o0SYpQg0R6nmL6nmIDeQ,1,"Stay away from this place if you don't want to ""poison"" yourself -- not literally, but maybe if I ate my salad, I could have been.

My salad was beautifully covered with cubed mango and avocado but when I dug deeper ready to savor my meal, rotten salad leaves were hiding underneath. I thought there wasn't much, just one or two but no. So I left without eating dinner abd my husband completely losing his appetite, as well.

His chicken smelled mouth-wateringly delicious but the texture felt like it was re-heated once or twice. How do I know? I have reheated some chicken at home and it tasted like flip-flops!

The rice, even though my partner loves fried rice an the like, was left unfinished. He said it tasted like it was reheated, too. So there you go, a restaurant that shouldn't have been given license to open.

The kitchen staff couldn't care less of what happened/our complaint and even wanted us to pay for the salad. Thanks to Marian, who was actually a good waitress -- friendly and warm and patient, she managed to make the kitchen staff see logic -- so the salad was excluded in the bill.

In a nutshell, if you want to burn your money, have the worst dining experience and possibly a good food poisoning, then this is the food chain for you. This is yet the worst restaurant we've been to ever! Zero star? No. -1 star!!"
ChIJPf3o0SYpQg0R6nmL6nmIDeQ,3,"Place it's ok and the food too. The service is a bit poor actually. We sat inside because we have been told the only available table was booked( no one actually ever came to claim it) I asked for the chimichurri chicken and it took quite a long time even if it is precooked. Again, the food it's ok, the real turn-off is leaving the place and smell like grilled  meat."
ChIJPf3o0SYpQg0R6nmL6nmIDeQ,5,Tasty food and great service. Been here with family and we all enjoyed the experience. Highly Recommend.
ChIJPf3o0SYpQg0R6nmL6nmIDeQ,5,A great place for breakfasts with a good selection of choices. The food was also very tasty
ChIJtfgePSQpQg0RQWumstr-w_E,5,"Absolutely good!
I highly recommend this restaurant, and you need to try all tacos and also suchi and makis are great and delicious.
You have the posibility to choose one from each to try all.
Book it in advance and select the prior salon."
ChIJtfgePSQpQg0RQWumstr-w_E,4,"Conveniently located in nueva espa√±a, this large asian fusion restaurant is nicely decorated and popular with young and not so young crowds. Food is very good, especially the slow cooked right off the bone ribs. Some dishes are glazed with too many sauced but overall its a good pick for a romantic or a friends dinner"
ChIJtfgePSQpQg0RQWumstr-w_E,4,"Amazing experience. Fusion, creative cuisine with good ingredients and unexpected combinations. Most of the dishes have half portions available.
Service was attentive. Average prices."
ChIJtfgePSQpQg0RQWumstr-w_E,5,"I was taken to this nice restaurant to celebrate my birthday and it was 100% my match as I loved everything about it; an asian fusion restaurant beautifully decorated with a good variety in their menu, but I must highlight their  bao‚Äôs ü§§. The desserts and wine selection were also very good and the service was excellent. I‚Äôm dying to come back soon :).

I recommend it üëåüèº"
ChIJtfgePSQpQg0RQWumstr-w_E,4,"I'd describe this restaurant as a gastronomic experience. There's so many different options in the menu that you'll be delighted to try any of them!
We had nigiris, cubana, octupus salad (the star of the meal! Amazing: freshness, texture and creamy in just one spoon), huevos a baja temperatura (this one is more risky, it's a whole egg fried with bread on its outside and served in bed of creamy potatoes/cheese/truffle/, something that I could not really identify. You're supposed to slice the egg and mixed it all very well and then serve it). We also ordered both baos from the menu."
ChIJtUn1XSYpQg0RtmlUVSjLfo4,4,Good seafood restaurant in up and coming hispanoamerica district in madrid. Food was very good just a tiny bit below top notch. Ironically what i liked the most was the beef steak which was cooked to perfection: tender crispy in the outside and juicy. The restaurant itself sits in a covered cabin on the street itself but the atmosphere feels very nice. Price was about ‚Ç¨50 per person. Very good for groups and to share platters. You can park for free in the area outside of normal business hours. It can get busy at some points during the weekend but generally its fairly easy to find a parking spot.
ChIJtUn1XSYpQg0RtmlUVSjLfo4,5,"We dined here during a recent trip to Madrid. The seafood is fresh and delicious, simply cooked, fairly priced. Friendly, helpful service comes free. We'll be back.

January 4 2023
We ate here again during a recent visit to Madrid. We were delighted to re-visit Norte Sur Costa Rica. The roasted fish for two was superb, as were all our dishes. Table service, as ever, was friendly and expert."
ChIJtUn1XSYpQg0RtmlUVSjLfo4,4,"Really good balance between price and quality! Fresh seafood cooked beautifully, very nice service!"
ChIJtUn1XSYpQg0RtmlUVSjLfo4,4,Very good meat and fresh fish. Best preparation is grilled. Also like the cheese  flan
ChIJtUn1XSYpQg0RtmlUVSjLfo4,5,Awesome food at great prices. Expect to spend around $30 per person to have an incredible meal
ChIJq1IbKh8pQg0RQVpR-ifA6jg,1,"Worst Lizarran experience I ever had. I know Lizarran from. North Spain, but this one in Madrid is just sad.
30 minutes and not a single Pincho came. We asked before if they would come and they said yes."
ChIJq1IbKh8pQg0RQVpR-ifA6jg,3,"A chain establishment with a typical range of tapas and drinks.
The food is below average: strange combinations and everything is cold at a rather high price for such establishments."
ChIJq1IbKh8pQg0RQVpR-ifA6jg,5,Great food with great price! I ordered the menu of the day which included 3 tacos but I thought it was too much and I said I wanted only 2. The waiter made sure to let me know if I still wanted the third one he would make it after. Adorable staff and amazing place
ChIJq1IbKh8pQg0RQVpR-ifA6jg,4,"Nice place to grab a quick bite and a beer.  The food is nothing fancy but the staff was super nice and the atmosphere was very relaxed, it was a good mix of people from sports fans to business travelers.  Relatively inexpensive and worth a quick drop in especially if you are trying to figure out your night might take you."
ChIJq1IbKh8pQg0RQVpR-ifA6jg,5,I liked it for a couple of beers and Tapas on a hot day. Very cold and decent price beer. If you get the smaller beer ( ca√±a) you get a tapa with it during happy hour ....all for less than 2 euro. Sidewalk and indoor tables.
ChIJT1bE1B4pQg0R568UPwbZwoE,1,"Booked this place based on a recommendation well in advance only to be called with 3 hours to go that they now have a group booking and can‚Äôt accommodate us inside. Might have been fun in the summer but not while having to shelter from April hail showers. Abstain, abstain, abstain."
ChIJT1bE1B4pQg0R568UPwbZwoE,5,"Last night in Madrid and we were looking for a nice place near our hotel.  Pablo, our waiter , went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience!  We had amazing food and a great evening.  I highly recommend making reservations! ¬°delicioso!"
ChIJT1bE1B4pQg0R568UPwbZwoE,3,"Tortilla was meh, Solomillo was also so-so.

But happy to be here just for the Jam√≥n and wine! Mostly weekday lunch crowd of friends and family."
ChIJT1bE1B4pQg0R568UPwbZwoE,5,"Wonderful- fantastic tasting, great food , perfect service and the best : you can taste by Glas the best wines ranked n the top 25- went again the next day -"
ChIJT1bE1B4pQg0R568UPwbZwoE,4,"Excellent restaurant with well trained staff,
Good choice of menu dishes and wines ,
I had excellent croquettes very light and full of flavor  , then the classic broken eggs with hand cut ham , very good bread and a refreshing dessert , I can see why it was full for lunch."
ChIJ3VA-3h4pQg0RHYqgWgcIiPI,5,"I was the only customer at 13.30 lunch on a Sunday. The cecina was the best I've ever had, really good. For the main, I had the 40-day aged steak recommended to me by the Maitre (shout out to him, I was doubtful between the 40 or the 90 day aged steak). The meat was very tender, juicy with lots of fat, and not weirdly funky like i know some aged meats are. Please be aware that the chuleta is huge, I ate alone and the smallest chuleta that day was 950 grams üòÜ, but you can ask to take it away if you can't finish it. For dessert I got the tiramisu, which was prepared directly in front of you by the waiter."
ChIJ3VA-3h4pQg0RHYqgWgcIiPI,5,Great food.  I totally recommend the tacos and the beef I had!
ChIJ3VA-3h4pQg0RHYqgWgcIiPI,5,"Truly fantastic restaurant. Service was top class, and food blew me out of the water. Would recommend anything on the menu - especially the tomato tempura."
ChIJ3VA-3h4pQg0RHYqgWgcIiPI,5,"Rocacho in Madrid is amazing! The food is delicious, especially the grilled meats, and the service is fantastic. It's a great spot for any night out, and I can't recommend it enough!"
ChIJ3VA-3h4pQg0RHYqgWgcIiPI,4,"Very good restaurant and the staff speaks English, which is always nice. We were with 3 and I think we could've done with one starter less. Burratte is good, not runny on inside, though, but HUGE. The shrimp carpaccio is amazing and tastes very much like good shrimp. The anchovies are spectacular, really give those a try! The steak was great. It was 1,5kg, it was too much for us, but the taste was unparalleled. It's a little expensive, but that's expected."
ChIJ94mmxB4pQg0RcOjrET6F-KA,5,Amazing food and great service! Yes you do pay the price but it is definitely worth it and is most likely the best sushi I‚Äôve had!
ChIJ94mmxB4pQg0RcOjrET6F-KA,4,"We came in for lunch. The sashimi is an exquisite delight, melting in your mouth with fresh flavors. The spicy tuna tartar offers a modern twist, although we found it to be rather too salty than spicy. The lobster tempura is with light, crispy batter. The jabali gyoza is my personal favorite, and the caldo is a delight. We also had their Rocher 99 and cheesecake 99. Attentive staff and meticulous presentation complete an authentic dining experience.

Price ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨"
ChIJ94mmxB4pQg0RcOjrET6F-KA,5,"At Sushi 99, the melt-in-your-mouth tuna nigiri and vibrant rainbow rolls blew me away. Each bite was a burst of fresh, flavorful ingredients, showcasing the quality and expertise of the chefs. The attentive service and tranquil ambiance made for a truly relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. The extensive wine list, with the help of a knowledgeable sommelier, allowed me to find the perfect complement to my meal. Sushi 99 is a must-try for anyone seeking an exceptional sushi experience in Madrid."
ChIJ94mmxB4pQg0RcOjrET6F-KA,5,This is seriously one of the BEST sushi bars in the world. The fish is all top quality and extemely fresh. The service here is also top notch. They really take care of all the small touches as well like taking and hanging your coat. It is a bit expensive but totally worth it.
ChIJ94mmxB4pQg0RcOjrET6F-KA,5,"Extraordinary, Michelin star worthy, and the best service of the chain. High prices, but the quality is good."
ChIJESvJPyYpQg0RIg_68_GQJ5I,5,"Authentic delicious damascene food with wonderful staff. Highly recommended. I loved the fattoush and the kibbeh labaniyyeh. Very clean and aesthetic place, true to the damascene spirit."
ChIJESvJPyYpQg0RIg_68_GQJ5I,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at La Damasquina restaurant, and it was an experience worth sharing. As an Indian trying Syrian cuisine for the first time in Madrid, I was both excited and curious about what awaited me. The restaurant exceeded all my expectations, delivering not just a meal, but a memorable culinary journey.

The food at La Damasquina was exceptional. Each dish was a delightful blend of flavors and spices, offering a perfect introduction to Syrian cuisine. From the rich and savory appetizers to the deliciously crafted main courses, every bite was a testament to the chef's expertise and passion for authentic cooking. The dessert was a sweet revelation, ending the meal on a high note.

What made the experience even more special was the amazing service. The owner himself greeted us warmly and took the time to explain each dish, making sure we felt comfortable and welcomed. It was clear that the food was prepared and served with love, adding a personal touch that is rare to find.

The ambience of La Damasquina is another highlight. The restaurant offers both closed and open seating areas, catering to different preferences. The indoor area is cozy and elegantly decorated, while the outdoor seating provides a charming atmosphere, perfect for a pleasant evening.

La Damasquina is a gem of a restaurant that I highly recommend. The combination of delicious Syrian food, outstanding service, and a lovely ambience makes it a must-visit. Whether you are a seasoned foodie or someone looking to try something new, this restaurant promises a delightful experience that you won't forget.üòä"
ChIJESvJPyYpQg0RIg_68_GQJ5I,4,"The food is just like what you‚Äôd get in the best restaurants in Damascus or Arabian city.
‚Äù  the authenticity of the cuisine is amazing, ‚ÄúWe have lived and travelled through the Middle East and enjoy Syrian food while listening to Omkaltom and classic Arabian music.

The quality of this food was high: wonderful smokey kofta and shesh, excellent shawarma , and the dessert of the Nabulsian konafa  all were moist and tasty with a well-balanced ingredients.‚Äù

The attentive staff, led by host Safy, ensures that every guest feels welcomed and satisfied."
ChIJESvJPyYpQg0RIg_68_GQJ5I,5,Food was delicious. The Muhammara was amazing and one of the best I‚Äôve had. Next time I am back in Madrid I will go again
ChIJESvJPyYpQg0RIg_68_GQJ5I,5,"The food was delicious and they have special Syrian good plates, at the end we take wonderful tea"
ChIJha_qCscpQg0Rbeox7USgZFw,1,"We try to eat in this branch today it tooks more that an hour to serve our order which is only 1 mediana pizza.o bottle of fanta and 1 bottle of water,"
ChIJha_qCscpQg0Rbeox7USgZFw,1,"Very expensive to stay hungry.
I suggest to avoid it in big angle"
ChIJha_qCscpQg0Rbeox7USgZFw,5,Super Spanish pizza -BABA
ChIJha_qCscpQg0Rbeox7USgZFw,1,"Maaaaan, trash food, trash fit, trash everything, the worker was rude, thats why dominos will always be better, smoking on that telepizzas pack."

ChIJu4YzISYpQg0RbB5Q4etTJpM,5,"5 stars for this place. I was recommended by a friend and they didn't disappoint. Friendly staff, very meticulous while recommending and giving explanations on the menu, possible combinations, wine...etc
We tried various dishes, being the steak tartare my favorite (with a spicy touch). Also the rice and the tuna were superb.
Quality/price relationship is also fair
Well done team El del Medio"
ChIJu4YzISYpQg0RbB5Q4etTJpM,5,"This was my second visit and I was very satisfied; small place is truly exceptional. The intimate setting feels familiar, the service is professional and friendly. Reservations are a must due to limited space. The dishes are delightful , with well combined ingredients and a harmonious blend of flavors. With so many great options, it's hard to pick a favorite, I recommend to share and enjoy the variety!"
ChIJu4YzISYpQg0RbB5Q4etTJpM,5,"One of the most interesting new openings in Madrid this year. Innovative, delicious food, familiar atmosphere, and Carla Bruni‚Äôs music in the room (what else?)"
ChIJu4YzISYpQg0RbB5Q4etTJpM,5,"delicious food, it's really a gastronomic experience"
ChIJu4YzISYpQg0RbB5Q4etTJpM,5,"Exceptional dishes, excellent service. A must visit place. There are very few tables, reservations neccessary."
ChIJD0-oZxkpQg0RthCdBdq7ops,5,Rubaiyat is a must-visit for meat lovers. The quality is out of this world! Each cut was cooked to perfection and the flavor was incredible. The service was attentive and the atmosphere elegant. Highly recommend!
ChIJD0-oZxkpQg0RthCdBdq7ops,3,"I would have given them 4 maybe 5 star because the meat was delicious and the food over all is good, the starter might needed more seasonings BUT my issue was the service, I had to ask for things twice and 3 times, I like my steak with mustard, it took me to ask 3 people to get it.
The desserts are too heavy, average.
The decor and ambiance were lovely.
I thought it was a bit expensive for the amount of food we ordered."
ChIJD0-oZxkpQg0RthCdBdq7ops,4,"Everything worked out perfectly‚Ä¶ till the bill came‚Ä¶üòµ‚Äçüí´ü§ë

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it is not that they overpriced (well‚Ä¶ slightly with the meat‚Ä¶ but it was fantastic anyways so happy to pay it) my issue is that as a customer, I like to make my own choices. Again, nothing wrong with quality and quantity; but in Spain; it usually is common that certain places bring a small tapa before you get in serious eating business‚Ä¶ we call it: ‚Äúopening the stomach or mouth‚Äù - ‚ÄúPara abrir boca‚Ä¶‚Äù so here they bring the mix platter and some amazing cheese fluffy small breads that are fantastic, but disguised into a tapa kind of deal that later you will have to pay for. And again, it‚Äôs not the price of it, it‚Äôs the principle of me having a choice whether I want it or not since am paying for it. Get it? At least ask if we want a tapa to begin with or not so I can choose.
Other than that, this is a fantastic place. Great ambience inside and outside on the summer terrace, big tables, comfortable chairs and nice light all around.
Service is good, friendly and profesional. Not excessively friendly, not too distant just the right attitude.
Then there‚Äôs the food. We had (besides the appetizers that were imposed to us) a great starter with a perfectly made king crab cannelloni and a great Master Beef piece, 40 days aged and a hot stone after it got a bit chilled. We ordered the mash potatoes with truffle and they brought the puffed fries. All this with great Ribera wine and wrapped up with the cheese cake and guayaba ice cream that is to die for."
ChIJD0-oZxkpQg0RthCdBdq7ops,3,"Very good food, you can‚Äôt fault it. Prices are somewhat surprisingly higher than you‚Äôd expect, not a major issue but you can safely assume 70-100 per head with no wine. Ambiance is nice enough and relaxed. It‚Äôs a nice experience. Service is really below par. Almost impossible to get anyone to listen, very very slow. Frankly unacceptable given the large premium they charge on a good but not ‚Äòmind blowing‚Äô meat meal. Would I go back? Meh. I can think of better places like Le√±a. Pity. This place has good potential."
ChIJD0-oZxkpQg0RthCdBdq7ops,5,"Great meat cuts and very consistent quality and service. Their cheese bread is to die for.
The Rubayat chain is one of my favourites in the world, a must go when I'm in Madrid, Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo."
ChIJ60ZqWhkpQg0R7BdQICQX-oI,4,Nice and cozy restaurant. Good place to have a quick lunch in the weekday. They have menu del dia with good selection of dishes.
ChIJ60ZqWhkpQg0R7BdQICQX-oI,3,"This place was a very mixed bag, a lovely atmosphere and an excellent location away from the road. The food was good, but the staff didn't seem to want to be there, and the service was very slow. The music was a little too loud, and at one stage was briefly turned up extremely loudly for some reason. Overall a shame as the detractors mean I'm unlikely to try again if in the area again."
ChIJ60ZqWhkpQg0R7BdQICQX-oI,1,"I read that the service is not good here but I wasn't expecting it to be as bad. First of all, they don't speak English at all. Trying to order in Spanish, I ended up scolded for my bad knowledge of Spanish. You can't expect smiles or even a neutral attitude towards the clients. Our experience here was a bad one, thus I can't recommend this place even for a coffee. There are plenty of other places to go that offer stellar service when compared with this one."
ChIJ60ZqWhkpQg0R7BdQICQX-oI,5,Great place to spend a lunch tea or dinner with you partner or friends
ChIJ60ZqWhkpQg0R7BdQICQX-oI,1,"The waitress never smiled. We were served a burger that had a huge raw piece in the middle. Not evenly cooked. She took it away and bought back the same burger that had been microwaved. Whole experience was shocking. Had we better Spanish language we would have complained. Instead we are leaving a bad review. Shame on you Nouba.   Madrid deserves better.
Visited 1/8/23 13.30"
ChIJa5k7mBkpQg0RrO1WzxwbBss,4,Food is expensive but soooo good. The area os beautiful and good service. Food portion good
ChIJa5k7mBkpQg0RrO1WzxwbBss,3,"Service was terrible here. It seemed like the waiter didn't want to be there. It's a shame because the place is nice.
They have 4.4 stars so maybe it was just a bad day!"
ChIJa5k7mBkpQg0RrO1WzxwbBss,5,"Was there for an organised evening event. Good service, reasonable prices. Great tapas was provided, mini chorizos, tortilla, morcilla.  Lots of choices of spirits."
ChIJa5k7mBkpQg0RrO1WzxwbBss,4,Great and cozy. The waiter is so polite and nice.
ChIJa5k7mBkpQg0RrO1WzxwbBss,5,"Good service, reasonable drinks, expensive tapas though"
ChIJj6FEkBkpQg0RKXfNJMHZBSY,4,"I never knew there existed Australian themed restaurants in the world, especially not in Madrid. Nevertheless, here we are.

This place is huge with two floors of seating and numerous amounts of tables. The menu del dia is well-balanced with a little something for everyone. They serve Chicken Marsala and Chicken parm to name a few. However, it‚Äôs still a restaurant in Spain so they also serve salmorejo and other Spanish food items.

Overall, the service was great, the atmosphere was welcoming, and the food was delicious. I will definitely be back."
ChIJj6FEkBkpQg0RKXfNJMHZBSY,1,"Totally disappointed. Nothing to do with Australia. Only the flag and boomerangs in the entrance. Horrible regaetton music. Very loud. Nothing Australian on the menu. Just a bunch of random food.
Will not go back and of course I will not recommend it.
Please change the name and don‚Äôt deceive people."
ChIJj6FEkBkpQg0RKXfNJMHZBSY,4,Nice place with a great decoration and good (yet not outstanding) food for reasonable prices. Had ribs for 19‚Ç¨.
ChIJj6FEkBkpQg0RKXfNJMHZBSY,5,Amazing atmosphere . The food is amazing. Surprised to find such a good place in the neighbourhood.
ChIJj6FEkBkpQg0RKXfNJMHZBSY,5,"We had a wonderful time having lunch here at Binju, Cristina and Stephanie were both amazing and super friendly staff. The vibes are amazing and the food delicious!"
ChIJd73N1BkpQg0R6XoMjZIZJJ4,5,We loved the experience. Frequented by locals which was refreshing. Can recommend Ib√©rica pork shoulder a la plancha. We will definitely want to return but with a bit more Spanish lingo.
ChIJd73N1BkpQg0R6XoMjZIZJJ4,5,"The food was incredible. We ate at the bar, and service was very spotty as it was crowded. That said, the atmosphere and food more than made up for it, and once an order was in the food came out quickly."
ChIJd73N1BkpQg0R6XoMjZIZJJ4,5,"The place has a good vibe, great for a summer evening. The highlight was definitely the bienmesabe order, the fish was so juicy and perfectly seasoned."
ChIJd73N1BkpQg0R6XoMjZIZJJ4,4,"Well, the waitress was a little weird...
She looks bored and rude..but late other waitress was very nice..
Nice place"
ChIJd73N1BkpQg0R6XoMjZIZJJ4,4,"Solid restaurant close to the Cuarto Deposito - excellent salmorejo and croquetas, entrecote and burger was soso. Also had the rabbit cops which were good"
ChIJX5c-UdMuQg0RyeV69z7QT8I,4,"Overall, the ambience of the restaurant is great. With the garden‚Äôs tropical Thai & Balinese feel. The service is great with all the Filipinos camareros and cook. The food is good and tasteful especially the Mango sticky rice."
ChIJX5c-UdMuQg0RyeV69z7QT8I,5,"Absolutely amazing. The flavors are complex and deeply developed. Their sambal is tradicional and packs a welcomed punch (careful, it‚Äôs real hot not just ‚ÄúMadrid hot‚Äù). The basil chicken was a hit for us. Also, you can‚Äôt miss the green curry.

The prefix menu is the best way to experience a little bit of all of the highlights"
ChIJX5c-UdMuQg0RyeV69z7QT8I,4,"The atmosphere is very good, the restaurant has a good atmosphere. There is a lot of sweets, and even in end of July, they are almost full for dinner.

The food was good. Nothing very special, the pad Thai had too much oyster sauce. The green curry was very good, however I think the rice accompanied was slightly undercooked. Definitely wood recommend the Nua Kratiam, absolutely amazing. 4/5 because not every dish is good.

The service was good. I would say even too fast. We ordered everything to share, they brought everything at one time, and there was no space on the table.

So a good 4/5"
ChIJX5c-UdMuQg0RyeV69z7QT8I,4,Fabulous ambience and decor. Little Thailand within Madrid. Thai sticky rice & mango was our favourite. Pad Thai was amazing too. Chicken satay had a strong flavour of coconut milk.
ChIJX5c-UdMuQg0RyeV69z7QT8I,4,"Went with my husband, two kids, and the family dog.  The restaurant is beautiful, and the outside area one of the nicest I have seen in Madrid.  The staff are super friendly and the service five stars.  They even brought our dog a bowl of chicken!!

I felt the food was a mixed bag, however.  The green curry and fish with tamarind sauce were really nice.  The Pad Thai, however was way too sweet and the papaya salad quite far from the traditional one - felt like it needed quite a bit more lime and flavour.  The prawns on all of those were really fresh and well cooked  though.  The many and sticky rice was superb! Overall, we would come back and probably try a few more of the curries."
ChIJx_uVajIpQg0RK9CsDrorf5g,5,"Cozy and nice local place, perfectly served by people thar have been there for a long time and know how to do things properly.
Menu is limited, but it is because whoever comes to this place know what they want: good quality grilled food!
It has a very good outside terrace."
ChIJx_uVajIpQg0RK9CsDrorf5g,5,"I traveled from Barcelona to Madrid early in the morning.I was in a urgency, but I couldn't find the toilet and wanted to pay for use it.  The boss is very enthusiastic and provided free help. Thank you very much!Wish you have a good business."
ChIJx_uVajIpQg0RK9CsDrorf5g,2,Too old and dirty atmosphere
ChIJx_uVajIpQg0RK9CsDrorf5g,5,Excellent food and service and a lovely terrace. Great place for families
ChIJx_uVajIpQg0RK9CsDrorf5g,4,"Nice & friendly place, good food, excellent customer service"
ChIJtXZMcS4pQg0RrUcOu5Ld7S0,1,"Very disapointing experience. The club is totally closed for non -members. You can not even visit the courts. It is not possible to rent a court. On the entrance there is a safety Control like in a prison and they don't let you in (""only for members""). Don't go there !!!"
ChIJtXZMcS4pQg0RrUcOu5Ld7S0,5,Best tennis club in the heart of Madrid
ChIJtXZMcS4pQg0RrUcOu5Ld7S0,1,"I would not recommend this club to anyone who is concerned about the safety of their children. We found our 4 year old daughter walking alone on the street outside the club after her lesson. The tennis club and tennis school, which are 2 separate organizations, kept blaming each other. When we began to complain, as any parent would in our situation, we received an email saying that our daughter was kicked out of the school, because we caused a scene. Clearly, can‚Äôt trust this place to look after your children."
ChIJtXZMcS4pQg0RrUcOu5Ld7S0,2,"My one attempt to play tennis in Madrid and found out after 2 busses and plenty of walking that its private and I can't even pay for a lesson. So, my bad for not calling first, and screw this place anyway! The guy at the desk was a jerk."
ChIJtXZMcS4pQg0RrUcOu5Ld7S0,2,"Very old fashioned, definitely needs some investments in new equipment and cleaning service - it is very dirty. Great location though..."
ChIJS2GzFNQuQg0RGZ31OUNgwEc,5,"After so many years, they continue with good quality and their prices have not gone crazy like most places.

The empanadas and the skirt steak were the best and the biffe de chorizo was good ( that's what I asked and the quality was ok but a little cold on the inside). The staff was amazing and so is the set up of the restaurant."
ChIJS2GzFNQuQg0RGZ31OUNgwEc,1,"Very rude staff. The quality of the meat is absolutely unacceptable - if this place considers itself an Argentinian restaurant, you should be ashamed of what is provided there - the steak was salty, dry and not tender (I had to put a lot of effort into cutting it).
The desserts were ok. But please don‚Äôt call yourselves an Argentinian steakhouse, that‚Äôs offensive to the Argentinian culture."
ChIJS2GzFNQuQg0RGZ31OUNgwEc,2,"Waiters seemed too distracted to give tourists some attention. Courses which normally take a few moments to prepare landed our table after long 40 minutes with no apologies. Sauce had to be asked for, and additional bread costs 2‚Ç¨50c. We ordered food for 3 and were served for 2. Beer is unusually expensive, 5‚Ç¨ a mug!
Not recommended."
ChIJS2GzFNQuQg0RGZ31OUNgwEc,4,"Went when quiet but fantastic rib eye, lovely outside table and really enjoyed the the wine. Would definitely return"
ChIJS2GzFNQuQg0RGZ31OUNgwEc,5,A little bit expensive but worth the experience.
ChIJjbMvqzEpQg0RcgVx5HQ_3Rs,4,It was a delightful night. We went inside to see a big cosy restaurant. When we seated ourselves we were greeted by an awesome ‚Äòcamarera‚Äô is how you say it in Spanish. After placing our order we got our delicious food accompanied with a great smile. The food was as said very delicious for a good price. We wanted to try the tiramisu but we were so full of the delicious food we ate so we didn‚Äôt get to try it. Someday I will return for the tiramisu.This said I would 100% recommend this restaurant if you want good food with a fast service for a good price.
ChIJjbMvqzEpQg0RcgVx5HQ_3Rs,3,"Variable food quality depending on dishes. The pizza is OK, but not amazing. Milanese was not OK. Service is good and the place is decent inside. Not a lot of choice in that area, so is more than acceptable for lunch."
ChIJjbMvqzEpQg0RcgVx5HQ_3Rs,5,We just went for coffee to this place when they were about to close but they were very nice and patient to serve us and waited patiently for us to finish the coffee. Very kind and nice staffs. Highly recommended.
ChIJjbMvqzEpQg0RcgVx5HQ_3Rs,1,"The worst food I have ever had! Unfortunately one of the few places around to eat, but I would advise to leave it if possible. It's Expensive and almost mockingly ridiculous how they serve the dishes!!"
ChIJjbMvqzEpQg0RcgVx5HQ_3Rs,1,"Sad, unneccesary, expensive for ridiculous portions. Don't order panzerotti, two thin, empty sheets of pasta with tons of nothing-but-cream sauce for 12‚Ç¨!!! Stupid place."
ChIJ-xSGrS4pQg0RE3V6a0Hz5OU,1,"I used to go here some years ago, and it was a very good place to go with kids. But right now is awful. The tables are super dirty, full of sand.
The food has very bad quality, and the worse‚Ä¶ the price.
Everything is super expensive and if at least was cheap‚Ä¶.. but in fact is more expensive than a michelin star restaurant‚Ä¶ You can check the bill I have upload.
The kids are not good there anymore because there are too many and you need to be with them all the time‚Ä¶
For sure I won‚Äôt come back here and I would not recommend even to my worst enemy."
ChIJ-xSGrS4pQg0RE3V6a0Hz5OU,4,"Always a great option for lunch with a ""meal deal"" where you can have an appetiser, main meal, and dessert for about EU17.

Today I had a beef milanese filled with cheese and jamon and French fries as side.

For dessert I had watermelon and appetiser salmorejo."
ChIJ-xSGrS4pQg0RE3V6a0Hz5OU,3,Great place to go for drinks. The food is decent nothing out of this world. But if you are looking for a place for sunny days on the terrace with a cold drink while the kids play. This is it. Super family friendly. There‚Äôs a changing table in the bathroom. Lots of kids there so makes it easy for them to enjoy themselves as well.
ChIJ-xSGrS4pQg0RE3V6a0Hz5OU,3,"This is a great place to book for large family/friend groups although quite expensive for very normal food. Roasted artichokes (4) at 18‚Ç¨ for example. The bill soon mounts up. I like the interior but on a warm day the terrace is large with a children‚Äôs play ground making it popular for families with young children. However, I‚Äôve noticed lately that some members of staff are incredibly rude. On our last visit, the waitress was asking for our drinks order and when one of the guests did not answer immediately, she waved her hand in my friend‚Äôs face and said ‚Äòhello??? what do you want to drink?‚Äô Later we asked for a picture of our group & the same waitress very grudgingly obliged only to take a picture when we weren‚Äôt ready & fling the phone back to my friend. We were pretty unimpressed. Other waiting staff were pleasant although over taxed. Either they need to employ more waiters/tresses or change some of the staff."
ChIJ-xSGrS4pQg0RE3V6a0Hz5OU,5,"Amazing terrace in the sun. Playground for the little ones and a park where the older kids can play with a ball.
Good chicken fingers with honey mayonnaise .
Drinks served with aperitivos.
Good customer service.
We will be back!"
ChIJj1peSi0pQg0Rxo8UYCLTV1s,4,A safe bet for a casual Chinese dinner. Several years coming to this place. Always meeting the expectations. Good food and great price.
ChIJj1peSi0pQg0Rxo8UYCLTV1s,3,"I know this place as from 1999.
It is nice, typically ""Chinese for Spain"" food.
The men√∫ for 15.50 EUR is good."
ChIJj1peSi0pQg0Rxo8UYCLTV1s,5,One of the best Chinese Restaurants in Madrid. It is always good to come and and so far we never got disappointed. The spring rolls are amazing as well as the fried rice with chicken. The price is unbeatable.
ChIJj1peSi0pQg0Rxo8UYCLTV1s,2,"Food way too oily and not spicy enough. I ordered a dish with chicken and it was supposed to be spicy, however it was only overly salty and waaaay too oily. The service was nice, can't complain about that, however, if you really enjoy more authentic Chinese food this is definitely not the place for you."
ChIJj1peSi0pQg0Rxo8UYCLTV1s,5,Delicious and affordable food with good vegetarian options. Staff were very helpful and tried their best to communicate in English and understand my bad Spanish. It helps that the menu has English translations too!
ChIJ36wXGyQpQg0RkDgfrtsuLss,4,Good place for the afterworks beer
ChIJ36wXGyQpQg0RkDgfrtsuLss,5,"Always busy, nice atmosphere"
ChIJ36wXGyQpQg0RkDgfrtsuLss,5,"Best beers in Madrid, plenty of tapas that come with the beer.... quality of beer is great. Slightly lighter in alcohol content, perfectly tapped ...you can drink many and feel perfectly ok !!! A must"
ChIJ36wXGyQpQg0RkDgfrtsuLss,5,"Must go. Great food. Really good service with English speaking staff, English menus etc.
Great vibes too, we went for both lunch and dinner."
ChIJ36wXGyQpQg0RkDgfrtsuLss,5,This is our favourite bar in the barrio. They have a long very loyal group of clients that come here frequently to have drinks and/or an aperitivo. The waiters are exceptionally nice and the service is usually fast.
ChIJB3XOkdQuQg0RhQl10mj_Zmg,4,"Very pleasantly surprised at the freshness and very nice presentation of the fish we had for dinner......and the wine was yummy, too! Small but comfortable bar, good service, too."
ChIJB3XOkdQuQg0RhQl10mj_Zmg,4,Food is at a very good price but the bar doesn't feel very premium.
ChIJB3XOkdQuQg0RhQl10mj_Zmg,3,"Nothing fancy, pretty average place. Coffee is not good but passable"
ChIJB3XOkdQuQg0RhQl10mj_Zmg,3,A typical bar for the city with the food and the tapas.
ChIJB3XOkdQuQg0RhQl10mj_Zmg,5,Nice
ChIJpVdBXtgoQg0RqY50OxMvPDE,4,"We had a quick stop here to eat some tapas & have a glass of wine during our stopover flight.
The service was really good, they were friendly and fast."
ChIJpVdBXtgoQg0RqY50OxMvPDE,5,"Very cozy. We went to eat and ordered croquettes and cachopo, everything was delicious and both the cook and the waiter were very friendly. We even had coffee again later in the afternoon! I'm sure we'll go back there"
ChIJpVdBXtgoQg0RqY50OxMvPDE,5,"Croquettes, Torreznos, Cachopo - phenomenal"
ChIJpVdBXtgoQg0RqY50OxMvPDE,5,"Magnificent attention from Daniel. Good meats, excellent cod and homemade desserts. Very nice place. In short, highly recommended to enjoy quality at reasonable prices."
ChIJpVdBXtgoQg0RqY50OxMvPDE,4,"We went to their terrace on a sunny Sunday and it was divine. The best, the scrambled egg, potato and chorizo. It has a wide variety of tapas and dishes at a reasonable price."
ChIJOwM69NQuQg0RYVNk8rpeMBw,4,"Good Chinese restaurant, impeccable service and food quality.  The main salon is cosy but could do wiry some refurbishment. Varied menu, better stick to Chinese rather than Thai or Japanese. Loved the curry masaaman beef"
ChIJOwM69NQuQg0RYVNk8rpeMBw,3,"Menu degustaci√≥n: It includes pechinese duck (first time I see it included in such a menu), really good starters, below average sushi. It's ok, nothing so special. Elegant layout."
ChIJOwM69NQuQg0RYVNk8rpeMBw,5,"We had a great dinner here, very friendly and lovely staff, some English speaking staff which was helpful. The food was amazing and worth every euro. The service was very prompt aswell."
ChIJOwM69NQuQg0RYVNk8rpeMBw,5,"Good choice of dishes from both Japanese and Chinese cuisine. Buffet menu available all day from Mon -Friday is nice.

Costs about ‚Ç¨15-20 per person including drinks."
ChIJOwM69NQuQg0RYVNk8rpeMBw,5,"What a lovely culinary experience. Food was delicious, huge portions and very reasonably priced brought by a very helpful waitress.   Would only suggest they advertise their position more as it was so badly lit outside we walked passed it twice."
ChIJbe6lxiYpQg0RvMKW9bcqViw,4,My fruity salad was a perfect explotion of flavours. 10/10
ChIJbe6lxiYpQg0RvMKW9bcqViw,4,Friendly Service. Standard VIPS food.
ChIJbe6lxiYpQg0RvMKW9bcqViw,3,"I love vips and I almost try every plate,but,this time as I mentioned I want well done cook,my burger was not cooked properly and the chess cake was very cold inside and hot outside."
ChIJbe6lxiYpQg0RvMKW9bcqViw,1,"Worst burger restaurant I have ever been. For the second for no bacon burger and they bring with bacon. Very slow and they never do well done cooking. Normally, I try to avoid negative feedback but this experience can not be tolerated."
ChIJbe6lxiYpQg0RvMKW9bcqViw,5,A good place to have breakfast and dinner. Local and international cuisine. Tasty local starters and main one as well. Reasonable pricing.
ChIJRcJZGNUuQg0RheXyMnaQjjE,5,"This shushi chain is one of my favourites, not only because of the food but also the prices are good. They also have ‚Äònew in‚Äô products every now and then so you can always try something different. Last time I ordered the new Sanbei Shushi starter and it surprised me with flavours and textures, was very nice. I use to order online and they are so fast delivering. Thank you for having such a good serviceh."
ChIJRcJZGNUuQg0RheXyMnaQjjE,2,"Too much rice in makis. Usually I can eat a lot, but it is the first time I can't eat all because of the rice and so few ingredients which don't taste good... I won't order again."
ChIJRcJZGNUuQg0RheXyMnaQjjE,2,"Sushi is ok, although rice seems not so well prepared. Noddles are low quality."
ChIJRcJZGNUuQg0RheXyMnaQjjE,2,Poor quality sushi
ChIJRcJZGNUuQg0RheXyMnaQjjE,5,"High quality food, on time!!!!!"
ChIJS2zsTSEpQg0RSupTC7MJylE,5,"The best hamburger ever. And I‚Äôve tried the (supposedly) 10 best hamburgers in New York...
The ‚Äúmorcilla‚Äù croquettes absolutely delicious; the cocido looked amazing.
And the waiters absolutely great. Very nice, helpful and accommodating. And absolute must if you‚Äôre in the area."
ChIJS2zsTSEpQg0RSupTC7MJylE,5,"The place where busy, really busy, a lot of big tables with entire families eating in the place. We arrived without reservation and almost end of the Lunch service, and they found a table for us the attention was really good considering the fact that they were packed. Really generous portions, we order the Arroz Caldoso with Bogavante and we couldn't eat it all, it was more than sufficient for 4 and we were only three.
Definitely a place to repeat sometimes soon."
ChIJS2zsTSEpQg0RSupTC7MJylE,5,Classic Spanish/Madrile√±o dishes done very well
ChIJS2zsTSEpQg0RSupTC7MJylE,3,"First night in so needed something close by. Our waitress spoke great English. Food was good, friends said their croquettes were amazing, a goats cheese salad looked fab. Few drinks and desserts without breaking the bank."
ChIJS2zsTSEpQg0RSupTC7MJylE,5,"I can't leave Madrid without have a dinner in Casa Pello.
Delicious food."
ChIJF3w_xiYpQg0RFtdEiAhsiTQ,2,"If you‚Äôre travelling from North America and you miss The Olive Garden because you have no taste buds left, come here.
Staff is nice, but food is same quality as East Side Mario‚Äôs/Sbarro/Olive Garden.
Pre made frozen mediocrity. I‚Äôm giving it a 3 because the staff is nice, but it‚Äôs a zero gastronomic experience.
I was in a hurry and made a terrible choice to eat here."
ChIJF3w_xiYpQg0RFtdEiAhsiTQ,4,"If you like Italian food, you will find good and many alternatives. Prices for main course with non-alcoholic beverage range ‚Ç¨16/18 per person"
ChIJF3w_xiYpQg0RFtdEiAhsiTQ,5,Lovely Service and amazing food! Super recommended! Will be back many times :)
ChIJF3w_xiYpQg0RFtdEiAhsiTQ,5,Jesus was an amazing waiter he was doing an amazing effort to explain us the menu and gave us incredible recommendations. Highly recommended.
ChIJF3w_xiYpQg0RFtdEiAhsiTQ,5,"This delightful Italian restaurant is situated close to Columbia metro station along with a host of other restaurants and cafes.
Staff were friendly, welcoming and engaging.
Good length menu with plenty of tasty options. Salads and pasta dishes were very well sized, which we finished off with delicious desserts."
ChIJN-1AeigpQg0RYFX1L1Cx-II,2,"V overpriced 16‚Ç¨ menu del d√≠a.  Grated carrot out of a jar. Salty reheated roast chicken.  Industrial cheesecake.
Friendly staff was a plus."
ChIJN-1AeigpQg0RYFX1L1Cx-II,5,"Good menu , perhaps too crowdy"
ChIJN-1AeigpQg0RYFX1L1Cx-II,5,"Great restaurant. A menu of 10, very well presented, good product with friendly treatment that makes you feel at home. Congratulations on a job well done"
ChIJN-1AeigpQg0RYFX1L1Cx-II,5,"I have breakfast there every day. The staff is very friendly and polite. The potato omelette is homemade and is simply spectacular. They have a menu of the day in which on Thursdays there is always cooked food (which is brutal). It has an outdoor terrace with braziers under the tables, for when it is cold, and separation with screens between them."
ChIJN-1AeigpQg0RYFX1L1Cx-II,3,"I go almost every week because I study nearby, the blonde lady who serves is very friendly, but today the man served me and he was rude for not calling him something else.
I was at the bar waiting while talking on the phone and I saw that the man came to put a coffee, seeing that no one was serving me I took advantage and asked him if he could please put me one, to which he sarcastically replied ""well I don't know, I don't know if he can""... he gives me the coffee without sugar or anything and I tell him that I pay with a card, he goes to look for the dataphone when he literally had it in his face and I tell him ""it's here"" and about what he is charging me I ask him If he can add sugar and he tells me ""because you can't order everything at once""... I was like mmm okay. I had the coffee because I had already paid for it, but I didn't lack the desire to have left immediately.

From my point of view:
1. I asked him if he could give me some coffee as well, as if to say: can you help me? Since the bar was a little full and I thought that maybe the man would prefer to finish serving the other person (according to me being empathetic). But not so that he responded to me like I was stupid.
2. I think it should be the person serving who should worry about serving, ask how they are going to pay and put the sugar, right? If he had done his job quickly I wouldn't have had to tell him things little by little. And if you don't want to work, dedicate yourself to something else."
ChIJaWpEoSgpQg0Rz5jdB5CS--E,5,"Excellent service, neibourhood and a nice place to watch football or something enjoy a at the terraza"
ChIJaWpEoSgpQg0Rz5jdB5CS--E,4,"Good value for money for breakfast and tapas.

ChIJaWpEoSgpQg0Rz5jdB5CS--E,4,"Nice prices and flavours, but the service is a bit slow."
ChIJaWpEoSgpQg0Rz5jdB5CS--E,4,"Ni neighborhood bar, excellent beer and wine, free appetizers, nice patio, good place to watch football."
ChIJBWE0oSgpQg0RYvzj4EwfsYI,1,"We went on a Thursday morning for breakfast and we sat for 15-20 minutes and no one came to serve us.
There were hardly any people so it is not understandable
We were served before by a lady selling lottery tickets that the waiters
I will not return"
ChIJBWE0oSgpQg0RYvzj4EwfsYI,4,"Very delicious food, excellent atmosphere and good service...it is not expensive üòä"
ChIJe7fACmMpQg0RUX98A2erEtw,5,"Beautiful place! Decor gives a nice young vibe. We went around 11 pm, sat outside and they put the heaters on to keep us warm. We tried their margaritas and they were delicious. Ordered Nachos and enjoyed them. Good portion too. On top of that, we had a v good server. Kind and friendly! Would love to go again"
ChIJe7fACmMpQg0RUX98A2erEtw,5,"Amazing experience! We went there today for lunch at the terrace. Food, service from Al√≠ and ambiance were great! Really enjoyed Gracias Padre at Calle de Costa Rica. We‚Äôll be back very soon!!"
ChIJe7fACmMpQg0RUX98A2erEtw,5,Great staff. The place has great food for the value and the waiter Juan Carlos is a real charm.
ChIJe7fACmMpQg0RUX98A2erEtw,5,"Great Mexican Restaurant in Madrid! Loved the ambiance, We ordered the nachos, the frozen margarita is a must! Totally recommended"
ChIJe7fACmMpQg0RUX98A2erEtw,5,"Amazing cocktails... And food is great too...
Los camareros son muy divertidos."
ChIJ-2Xr3zIpQg0R6pjGmLGKeOc,2,"The service was not good.
The waiters were busy arranging the table and the TV to watch the football match at the Terraza."
ChIJ-2Xr3zIpQg0R6pjGmLGKeOc,5,"Very comfy place with delicious food, we ordered patatas bravas, hamburger (really recommend) and tortilla espanola:) The service was excellent 6/5!! I would definitely come back hereü§ó"
ChIJ-2Xr3zIpQg0R6pjGmLGKeOc,5,Excellent service! Jessica was amazing. She manages so well the local. I went with a group of friends and we spent a good time!  I recommend to try Cachopo Asturiano and Croquetas Portobello. I also tried Tarta de Queso Casera. There are many options of Tortillas.
ChIJ-2Xr3zIpQg0R6pjGmLGKeOc,5,"It is a very good atmosphere, a quiet place to enjoy drinks from a variety of choices, The staff are friendly, The service was quick and the food was good.
A place to visit again."

ChIJbzFpIiYpQg0R1-CJSafU724,5,"Look no further, the best tapas, the best portions, typical dishes of our land in the best atmosphere, stop by and tell me what you think.
A super nice atmosphere and very good customer service. Beautiful place, I recommend it."
ChIJbzFpIiYpQg0R1-CJSafU724,4,"They treated us very well, we spent an afternoon drinking with my friends, good atmosphere, simple."
ChIJbzFpIiYpQg0R1-CJSafU724,2,"First of all, if they are offering grilled meat, when making the reservation they should inform you that you can only eat on the terrace or in an interior room, not that you arrive and are surprised that you cannot eat. what you went to try because your reservation is not in the right place. And not only that, but when you have chosen what to eat after not being able to eat meat, they tell you that they can move you. Very dizzying. Otherwise the food without more... I would not return."
ChIJ6QQKwTkpQg0RWq2joGEUr0g,1,Tacos were very bad. They put ketchup on them.
ChIJ6QQKwTkpQg0RWq2joGEUr0g,5,"Very good service and food just like the images, exquisite flavor, you can see the dedication in the preparation and treatment of the diners"
ChIJ6QQKwTkpQg0RWq2joGEUr0g,1,"A horror. Loud at night, they don't let the neighbors sleep a wink. Regrettable clientele. We're tired of kids drinking like there's no tomorrow and disturbing the neighborhood."
ChIJ6QQKwTkpQg0RWq2joGEUr0g,5,"We spent the penultimate night before saying goodbye at the airport to a person we love and remember every day from here, and the atmosphere of the place and especially the owner and staff turned the night into a joy that we will always remember, some mojitos, a Macallan and a Red Velvet marked the end of our dinner and the beginning of a future, all our love from Zaragoza and Santiago de Chile. Thank you."
ChIJ6QQKwTkpQg0RWq2joGEUr0g,5,Excellent designer covers
ChIJRXVnESYpQg0RzdV2X0a33Bw,5,"The food was great here. Fusion of Spanish and Asian food here as they have a Spanish chef and a Chinese chef per other reviews.

My personal favourite was the croquetas and the chipirones, whilst my gf loved the alitas pollo Frito in salsa coreana.

Service was good and attentive and there was plenty of interesting dishes on the menu, so I hope to come back again soon to try other dishes

P/S The bread and Jamon they served after taking your order was also very good too"
ChIJRXVnESYpQg0RzdV2X0a33Bw,5,Amazing! Recommend 100%
ChIJRXVnESYpQg0RzdV2X0a33Bw,4,"Ir was ok, good service"
ChIJRXVnESYpQg0RzdV2X0a33Bw,4,"We ordered menu of the day:
8Ô∏è‚É£ Bye rice. Recommended choice of the first

7Ô∏è‚É£'5Ô∏è‚É£ Sirloin with Roquefort sauce
7Ô∏è‚É£ Cachopo
8Ô∏è‚É£ 3 chocolate cake
8Ô∏è‚É£ Tiramisu"
ChIJRXVnESYpQg0RzdV2X0a33Bw,5,"A restaurant where you eat very well. Highlight the broken eggs and grilled squid. The boletus croquettes are quite delicious, the teque√±os come in a considerable portion and the prices are moderate. The service is very good, they are fast in their service and very friendly.
Also say that the ham muffins with tomato and potato omelette are very delicious and filling."
ChIJh12gFQApQg0R97bQnRmGqpU,5,"Fantastic Omakase and a great way to immerse a little in Japanese culture (while dining in Madrid).
The start is a bit slow and the experience will be influenced by the rest of the people there (8 pax in total)."
ChIJh12gFQApQg0R97bQnRmGqpU,5,"This has to be the best Japanese restaurant that I have eaten in in Madrid. Fantastic food. Great concept. Only open since May 2024 - so get in before it becomes impossible to book. Only up to 14 diners.  Expensive but really worth it - a
Mixture of GREAT food and the
Japanese experience."
ChIJh12gFQApQg0R97bQnRmGqpU,5,"The best omakase in Madrid! Recently opened, amazing experience all around, expect to be impressed with top quality and craftsmanship and just 12 seats! MUST TRY!!!"
ChIJh12gFQApQg0R97bQnRmGqpU,5,Absolutely fantastic. Authentic experience with the best Japanese food. Always a small group of diners with everything well explained in detail. Just amazing - this restaurant is going places.
ChIJh12gFQApQg0R97bQnRmGqpU,5,A wonderful and truly memorable journey through Japanese cuisine!
ChIJtyn6Wn0pQg0Ru2sKfKtStC8,5,Super delicious! Recommended to ask it warmed up üôÉ
ChIJtyn6Wn0pQg0Ru2sKfKtStC8,5,A lot of varieties and really good taste!
ChIJtyn6Wn0pQg0Ru2sKfKtStC8,5,"Very good empanadas, very very delicious. The guy who serves is a CAPO, very gentle and friendly. Really a great guy. Each empanada costs more or less 3.50 EUR, they vary a little depending on the flavor, but there are promotions if you buy boxes of 6 or 12."
ChIJtyn6Wn0pQg0Ru2sKfKtStC8,5,"I discovered them last night while walking with my family and everything went very well for us.

The empanadas are very delicious, both in flavor, texture and size. The dough seemed to me to be at its ideal point, normally you find some places that are very dry, or the edges are very thick, here the 5 that we ordered were perfect. The price/quality/size ratio is very well achieved.

The place is very well designed, nice, small, well branded, ideal for an empanada place without having to incur such high rental costs.

The service was very good, the girl who attended us was very attentive to us (Sat Nov 03 at night).

Recommendation: make the spicy meat empanada a little more spicy üòâ

I didn't know this brand and I just saw that they have several stores. They really have a well-made and franchisable concept. I hope they continue like this."
ChIJtyn6Wn0pQg0Ru2sKfKtStC8,5,"The empanadas are delicious!
It also has meat and chicken from HEURA!

The place is beautiful, it also has a terrace to eat there and the girl who served me was charming

I will repeat!"
ChIJhS6scFspQg0RpAh4lZAJM9Q,5,"authentic traditional fusion food, good prices atmosphere and service"
ChIJhS6scFspQg0RpAh4lZAJM9Q,5,"Everything was very good, we took advantage of a sushi offer and they really surprised us, we ordered a boat and we thought... we will eat all this and in the end it was so good that next time we asked for 1 boat each ü§§. Everything felt very fresh, 100% recommended for every sushi lover"
ChIJhS6scFspQg0RpAh4lZAJM9Q,5,"I loved it! Good music! Good atmosphere, Sara's service impeccable! Very kind and attentive! The sushi was delicious! It's been a while since I ate sushi with such enthusiasm! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'll be back soon!"
ChIJhS6scFspQg0RpAh4lZAJM9Q,5,"A very nice place, incredible service, and excellent food, 10 out of 10, we tried sushi and the pepito and we loved it‚Ä¶
We found the prices incredible for the quality.
We return 100% not only for the food but for the attention ü•∞"
ChIJhS6scFspQg0RpAh4lZAJM9Q,5,Rich and different! I don't know if I liked the Venezuelan or the Japanese more! Everything delicious and very good service! It's the second time I've come and it won't be the last!
ChIJaRDFRSYpQg0RucsxjGOt2PY,4,"Altho the bar is pleasant enough, there's not much space inside.But as long as the weather is good ..as is normal in madrid..it has an ample street corner terrace facing on to a circular street garden, a couple of blocks from the Colombia metro station."
ChIJaRDFRSYpQg0RucsxjGOt2PY,5,Good place to share a time with your friends and beers!
ChIJaRDFRSYpQg0RucsxjGOt2PY,5,Best place in town
ChIJaRDFRSYpQg0RucsxjGOt2PY,5,"A place with a very good atmosphere, to have beers, wine and exquisite toasts. I have it next to my house and it's a rare week that I don't visit it. Highly recommended!"
ChIJaRDFRSYpQg0RucsxjGOt2PY,1,"A disastrous experience. Avoid this place at all costs.
I have had the misfortune of visiting this ‚Äúbar‚Äù, and I put it in quotes because I doubt that you can call a place where dirt, arrogance and aggressiveness reign that way. Not only are the owners incredibly rude, but they go so far as to intimidate customers with violent attitudes. I witnessed how one of them threatened to attack a person for simply complaining about the service.

The food is absolutely disgusting. I found several hairs on the plate and, when I discussed it with the staff, the response was a mixture of ridicule and contempt. There is no hygiene or the slightest respect for the client. The entire atmosphere gives off a murky aura, and it is not difficult to notice that those responsible for the establishment have serious problems with substances. His erratic and aggressive behavior, together with lost looks and out-of-control attitudes, leaves little doubt about it.

I don't understand how this site is still open. A danger for anyone looking to have a pleasant time. Anymore."
ChIJex98WyYpQg0RtHdIsyBJ5fY,5,"Cool bistro/taberna style restaurant in Madrid (near Plaza Rep√∫blica Dominicana) offering a busy and friendly bar area and a bit more formal seating dinning room. The cuisine is Spanish with a twist of modernity and influence from
international ingredients. Tapas, salads, meats and even desserts are excellent. Frequented by locals."
ChIJex98WyYpQg0RtHdIsyBJ5fY,4,"The first waiter was strange. Did not understand the order / did not know Spanish that well.
But the food was very good!!! Jam of bellota , everything - delicious!"
ChIJex98WyYpQg0RtHdIsyBJ5fY,4,"The food was delicious.
The first waiter - did not understand well..."
ChIJex98WyYpQg0RtHdIsyBJ5fY,5,"The food was tasty, my mistake for forgetting to ask to have the meat well done üôà. The desert deserves 10 stars! ü§ò"
ChIJex98WyYpQg0RtHdIsyBJ5fY,5,Excellent tapas and steak! I recommend!
ChIJF9ocMdguQg0RI_t687jxaLk,4,"Nice restaurant! We came inside as it was a hot day today and wanted some AC. This place is a very typical Spanish restaurant - no gimmicks for tourists, just regular food spaniards normally would eat. Quality was pretty good, I loved the salmorejo and the wings were quite tasty. The flan was far from the best I've had but still enjoyable, and the whole meal was certainly very well priced (even more considering 2024 prices!). So, overall, pretty good food at a great price. I'd recommend trying it out!"
ChIJF9ocMdguQg0RI_t687jxaLk,5,Really nice local restaurant with surprisingly good meat!
ChIJF9ocMdguQg0RI_t687jxaLk,3,Cozy bistrot feel. Great entrec√¥te. Generous calamar and dishes.
ChIJF9ocMdguQg0RI_t687jxaLk,5,"The non-vegan Vegan!
Strolling along a Madrid suburb at dusk on a gusty autumn evening we chanced upon this exceptionally good restaurant near our lodgings. Here we were greeted by an informal, friendly atmosphere and although they were already heavily booked, they managed to acommodate us nonetheless.  The abundant plate of grilled vegetables and patatas bravas we ordered were the best l have ever tasted, which says a lot about the chef's skills. The entire staff were highly professional! ln my opinion this is a place worth going out of one's way for!"
ChIJF9ocMdguQg0RI_t687jxaLk,4,"The meat is great, one of thebest entrec√¥tes I've had. But the only seating space they have is a heated terrace with people smoking all around, and that's not great in 2024."
ChIJUex5OdIuQg0R3xZEU6uGhaA,5,"Fresh food, cooked to order. ‚Ç¨20 choose and eat as much as you want. One rule, please eat. Wonderful food, tastes incredible, huge selection. Lovely staff. Been here many times. Never disappoints."
ChIJUex5OdIuQg0R3xZEU6uGhaA,2,"Chinese buffet restaurant with table service.  A wide variety of dishes are offered, mostly chinese cuisine. The japanase (i.e. tempura) or thai dishes (pad thai) do not have the genuine taste expected.  The Dim Sum is good. Sunday flat fee is 15,90 euros but does not included desert, drinks nor coffee.  Actual price paid per person was 26 euros. I would probably not return."
ChIJUex5OdIuQg0R3xZEU6uGhaA,5,"Food was great, served quickly, staff nice and efficient. I tried 4 different things from the menu and everything was delicious."
ChIJUex5OdIuQg0R3xZEU6uGhaA,4,Good ambient nice staff. Good choice of men√∫s. Well prepared dishes enough quantity. I will come back
ChIJUex5OdIuQg0R3xZEU6uGhaA,3,"Before it was good and not expensive.
Now is too expensive for the quality that they offer.
I was coming back often when the menu was 15‚Ç¨, now I wont come back aymore"
ChIJN6BputcuQg0RuN5LubJZtuI,5,"One of the few sushi restaurant in Madrid that I like, the ingredients are super fresh, the portions are large and the waiters are very gentle!! They will introduce you to the dishes and recommend the best of them! It's very tasty! Recommended!"
ChIJN6BputcuQg0RuN5LubJZtuI,5,"There are a lot of options to eat, the place is decorated in a beautiful way. Chill atmosphere to get dinner and chat with friends and family"
ChIJN6BputcuQg0RuN5LubJZtuI,5,"I'm giving Kichi the highest rating because they have great sushi. It's very hard to find well made sushi, with great tasting fish and shrimp. Not one piece was any different from the other in quality and I couldn't resist going here every night of my stay.

Thank you!"
ChIJN6BputcuQg0RuN5LubJZtuI,4,"We had a very good meal over there. We both ate gouyza (or something like that) as a primary course that are a kind of pasta squares filled with meat and served with acid sauce and as a main course noodles with vegetables and ducks meat and it was really delicious!! The only thing I have to commit is that at the end the meek was a bit too fatty for us..
The air temperature was a bit fresh at the beginning because we were sitting in the corner of the restaurant, but after a while the waiter brought a mobile heater to our table so this problem was solved ;)
I can really recommend this restaurant, here you can eat good food for a low amount of money."
ChIJN6BputcuQg0RuN5LubJZtuI,4,"Very good!!! I take a 10‚Ç¨ menu. Miso soup, shrimp salted with vegetables, beverage and fruit Macedonia. Quick and good service."
ChIJBcLIadQuQg0Rm_8gMn6av40,1,"Comically bad. No menu, electronic screens to show menu are out of service, and employees and unfriendly and have no answer to the questions ""do you have a menu? How do I know what you're selling?""
Definitely avoid."
ChIJBcLIadQuQg0Rm_8gMn6av40,1,I was ordering using the promo in the app and they said that i cant because a lot of people are asking for it. They can only give out one per person. But i have the 5  kids in the car and i cannot bring them all in the reataurant because all of us wanted the promo. And they refused our order. Better not put out the promo if they refuse to give it.
ChIJBcLIadQuQg0Rm_8gMn6av40,3,"Average burger king; quite small - only 4 ordering screens, one of which was closed, few staff and enough seats for about 50 people at max capacity. Toilets were a bit dirty too"
ChIJBcLIadQuQg0Rm_8gMn6av40,5,I received an exceptional customer service from one guy in the cash. He was really enjoying his job. The world needs more people loving what they do!
ChIJBcLIadQuQg0Rm_8gMn6av40,1,"There isn't much you can expect from a fast food place but this one still manages to disappoint.

This had to be the dirtiest BK I've seen. The employees look like they rather be crawling in mud. But by far the worst thing is the food seemed made the day before and the last time the they changed the frying oil was a month ago. The fries had black bits and tested rancid. Had the fries changed and the same thing.

I don't think one can have a good experience in a fast food place, it's the occasional necessity but it surely could be worse than expected."
ChIJQ7yWjdwuQg0RO9JBn67zgvY,5,"Family Friday 6 euro big pizzas!!! Staff always very friendly.

Edit: the promo is on Thursday, and it costs 7 euro now."
ChIJQ7yWjdwuQg0RO9JBn67zgvY,5,Great place and memories.
ChIJQ7yWjdwuQg0RO9JBn67zgvY,3,Just one person for attending and kitchen.
ChIJQ7yWjdwuQg0RO9JBn67zgvY,5,The pizza was very good. The people were very friendly and the place was very cozy. We came from Carabanchel. And I would repeat again.
ChIJQ7yWjdwuQg0RO9JBn67zgvY,1,"We came to enjoy the pizzas to take advantage as we have always done of the endless pizzas&drinks promotion, it turns out that the first one they give you quickly but then the second and third don't arrive until you get desperate! We were alone, we didn't have orders online or by phone and we still waited more than half an hour for them to serve us... I don't know if they do it on purpose because the maximum time is 2 hours to eat the endless or I don't know... but we have grown old waiting for the pizzas! It's a shame because the girl who served us here last time was lovely and very nice!
Aside from that, it seems petty to me that they only served us a medium per round for 3 diners! Let's go what has never been seen before..."
ChIJTWf9wsYuQg0RmlsCHUZzuHg,4,Good karaoke

ChIJiXs4BNMuQg0RL5-2F3MqOqY,5,Wery good!!!!
ChIJiXs4BNMuQg0RL5-2F3MqOqY,1,"I have the opportunity to have visited this cafeteria several times, if I tell you 15 or 20, maybe I am an understatement. Before; When a woman with glasses wore it, it was a pleasant experience, you would chat with her and the topic of food, honestly it was from good to upwards. Since other people have taken him, I have had the opportunity to go several times, alone and with my wife, since we took the child to a very close daycare, and when we arrived earlier; We stop by for a coffee or something to eat, always a few minutes, nothing too long. I have to say, the person at the bar has never been pleasant; I have experienced it; and also my wife (one day she went with her mother; she is very short, and did not allow her to sit at a normal table, resigning herself to sitting on a high bench, very uncomfortable for short people; claiming that the others were for eating, when the place was empty). Anyway, unimportant things, in the end, you go have a coffee, a skewer and some portion, 10 - 15 minutes and you pass through everything, you overlook the lack of kindness and empathy. Yesterday, 04/28/2025, it was not like that, and I do not overlook it. After the general blackout, I left work around 1:00 p.m. to pick up the child, my wife always does it; But I tried to get there from home and the Pius XII tunnel was closed. With how difficult it was to communicate, and a little yelling, from the car I told him that I was passing; Even if it arrived in 3 hours, a 20 min journey became almost 1:45 min; without traffic lights and with M30 and M40 in the middle of chaos. I arrive, park and approach the Chinese man who is nearby; I think; a bottle of water and a piece of bread; in case the trip from the store to home, which is 10 minutes, turns into 2 hours. At the Chinese at 2:40 p.m., an endless queue. I approach the bar, and I tell him that I only have ‚Ç¨5 in cash, and some coins, that he should sell me a bottle of water, he will sell it to me; 2.25 is glass; I ask him if I can take it, he tells me that he will let me have it for 0.05 cent more; So far everything is reasonable. I tell him, please, sell me a piece of bread; and he tells me he can't; that if I buy a sandwich it comes with bread; but he didn't sell the bread alone. I tell you, I can't afford a sandwich; sell me that piece, let's say a 10cm piece; My son is 2 years old, older than that; I wasn't going to eat. That can't; that he can't sell me only bread. I explain why I'm asking him, that I have to pick up the child, that I don't know how long it will take me to get home; that no that no; that can't. And in the middle of the conversation he tells me; This will help us carry cash. Honestly, I didn't say anything out of politeness and because there were other diners at the bar; but a person like that does not deserve my respect, my empathy, much less my good wishes. I sincerely hope things go badly for you; but for people like you. Unpleasant, I can understand it, but not very human; That already has a limit. Both my wife and I, obviously you will not see us return to your establishment. I hope to never set foot in that place again, I hope we never need it. And at the end of the food, and the drink, my opinion is completely secondary; or goes to another plane; when there are people like this person who completely takes away your desire to go to your establishment. I leave this comment, so that those of you who go and will continue going, know what kind of people work there. They are no longer more or less professional, but rather more or less human. All the best."
ChIJiXs4BNMuQg0RL5-2F3MqOqY,1,"I went to order half a menu to take away (to my office, which is 50 meters away). For dessert I ordered cheesecake and when I went to eat it (after trying a piece) I realized that it had mold. Lots of mold.

I came back to tell the waiter, and to see if he would refund the money for the menu or at least subtract what was proportional to the cake. However, what was my surprise to see that not only did he not want to return the money, but he also removed all blame and responsibility. According to him, the cake was fine when I took it out of the restaurant and in those 10 minutes that it took me to eat it, it underwent a change in temperature and became like this. Judge for yourselves.

I could be a regular customer because I work next door but after this they have lost a few more."
ChIJiXs4BNMuQg0RL5-2F3MqOqY,4,A good atmosphere to eat or have a few drinks with friends. I recommend booking because it fills up.
ChIJiXs4BNMuQg0RL5-2F3MqOqY,5,"Fantastic value for money. Abundant portions, quality product and at a good price. A group of 6 people treated us quickly and very kindly, on a very pleasant covered terrace. We will repeat for sure!"
ChIJlUcJyWkvQg0RvQtkhAd0gts,5,"Beautiful place, we went to have a drink and snack/eat, the waitress was super attentive, she recommended the beer which was very delicious, then she described each dish very well and stopped by from time to time asking if everything was okay or if we wanted something else.
The food was very delicious, the meat well cooked and seasoned. The Brioche bread was a little cold and ""cooled"" the meat a little, but it didn't affect it at all.
The atmosphere was super cozy
We will return"
ChIJlUcJyWkvQg0RvQtkhAd0gts,5,"Un local muy bonito y con una oferta diferente, original y divertida, con buena m√∫sica una barra preciosa y el personal muy agradable y atento.
Me tom√© un po boy (bocadillo) de rabo de toro que estaba buen√≠simo acompa√±ado de ensalada de col y patatas fritas, muy rico! y tienen unos postres... Ideal tambi√©n para tomar una copa, deseando poder estrenar esa terraza tan agradable. Necesit√°bamos en la zona un espacio as√≠! :)"
ChIJlUcJyWkvQg0RvQtkhAd0gts,4,"Newly opened place, very cool decorated, great for having a few beers and an aperitif.
It has a terrace for tapas or dinner.
Good atmosphere at night.
Advisable.
I went with the tapa route and I really liked it."
ChIJlUcJyWkvQg0RvQtkhAd0gts,5,I liked everything very much. The food was delicious. We ate quite well and for ‚Ç¨14 per person! The atmosphere is very pleasant and the service is charming. We will definitely repeat
ChIJlUcJyWkvQg0RvQtkhAd0gts,5,"First visit for lunch and we will surely return. We had the Po' boy Toroloco (oxtail, guacamole and red onion) with fries and coleslaw. For dessert, homemade brownie that they didn't have, but that they made for us on the spot. All very good. Taking advantage of the good weather, the terrace invited you to stay and so did the good service. Very good."
ChIJ4127d7wvQg0Rlb7CHcIsqrg,5,"Great ‚Äú‚ÄòMenu del dia‚Äù for lunch (during the week). Very friendly service, we went with s baby stroller and they were very accommodating. Tables inside and outside.
Simple and local atmosphere"
ChIJ4127d7wvQg0Rlb7CHcIsqrg,1,"We come here to enjoy with friends,we seat outside and we start asking for beers around 17:00 and they didn‚Äôt bring us no TAPA until 19:30. Normally when you order a beer in Madrid bring you a Tapa in this place at this time NO. THANK YOU but next time I‚Äôm not coming here and not recomendaci√≥n for this place. Gracias."
ChIJ4127d7wvQg0Rlb7CHcIsqrg,5,"Really friendly staff, very professional. Our Spanish is limited and so is their English but we got along together really well!  The food was fantastic quality, very fresh and tasty. Would really recommend."
ChIJ4127d7wvQg0Rlb7CHcIsqrg,5,Wonderful neighborhood pub.
ChIJ4127d7wvQg0Rlb7CHcIsqrg,5,Durisimooo vicennn!!!
ChIJxxv6w-AvQg0RhAKotu8fpyM,5,Cool
ChIJxxv6w-AvQg0RhAKotu8fpyM,4,"Very cool place with tables to drink or eat inside.
It has a large television screen.
It has a terrace.
I was on the chulapona tapa route and we liked the tapa."
ChIJxxv6w-AvQg0RhAKotu8fpyM,5,"Very good atmosphere, I love the place, it's amazing, super beautiful. In addition to the service and attention another thing, excellent food and quality of products. The drinks and desserts too much. Recommended 100!"
ChIJxxv6w-AvQg0RhAKotu8fpyM,5,The food was very good (the croquettes are highly recommended) and they treated us great. Super fast service. We will definitely return!
ChIJxxv6w-AvQg0RhAKotu8fpyM,4,A charming space to have some wines or beers. They serve good appetizers and the service is good.
ChIJA70WZbovQg0RnR_rA3RAijI,5,"A very cute cafe around.
Interiors were very catchy and i think French inspired.
It was a surprise for me to find the cheesecake from Basque here. It was mind-blowing.
They have other varieties of pastry and coffee as well.
The people around help you with your order if you arent sure what to buy.
They have an exterior sitting as well.
Great music , coffee and tarta de queso!!
Loved the place.
Definitely going back for the cheesecake and coffee."
ChIJA70WZbovQg0RnR_rA3RAijI,5,"Such a pretty and cute cafe, great food and exceptional service. The servers are so polite and welcoming! My go to cafe, love it here!"
ChIJA70WZbovQg0RnR_rA3RAijI,5,Don‚Äôt miss three cheese sandwich! Nice avenue for outdoor snacks
ChIJA70WZbovQg0RnR_rA3RAijI,1,"The food was unexpectedly bad. I had the breakfast burrito and my wife had the avocado and egg sandwich. Both were bad, they were drowned in mayo and had low quality ingredients. I expected the burrito to have burrito style meat (shredded)but it was a very bland ground beef probably cooked in ketchup. The service and atmosphere were fine, it might be fine to have a drink but don't have brunch here"
ChIJA70WZbovQg0RnR_rA3RAijI,5,Nice and small local place with simple but tasty food. Very good for breakfast
ChIJl_NmoPAvQg0Rpf6PKT-kaNg,5,So really delicious food
ChIJl_NmoPAvQg0Rpf6PKT-kaNg,5,"I already tried twice, the food is very good!"
ChIJl_NmoPAvQg0Rpf6PKT-kaNg,5,Very good Asian cuisine to take away. We had the duck noodles and the Cantonese fried rice. They prepare it for you at the moment in the glass-enclosed kitchen. Super friendly. Magnificent contribution to the neighborhood.
ChIJl_NmoPAvQg0Rpf6PKT-kaNg,1,"The owner of the establishment lies to us and scams us by saying that the food comes out every five minutes, repeating that every approximately 10 minutes and it never comes out. That combined with putting up with a smell of fried food and poor hygiene in a dingy establishment, without windows and poorly conditioned."
ChIJl_NmoPAvQg0Rpf6PKT-kaNg,5,"First time visiting Madrid and I didn't know what to eat or where to go and I found this restaurant, I was delighted, I loved the service, the food, the atmosphere, everything was very comforting.
Without a doubt it will be a place I will return to‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJ8Sn8OtQuQg0RTLsb7Z3QjU4,5,Cheap and delicious meals. I loved the croquettes!
ChIJ8Sn8OtQuQg0RTLsb7Z3QjU4,5,"A highly recommended place to buy meals, one of the best roast chickens I've tried.
The ink rice with squid, delicious. The pastries and desserts üç® very delicious.
The gentleman is very kind.
I got a menu of roast chicken with fried sweet potatoes and roasted peppers, with two drinks, an amount of wine for two people.
Good quantity. Good price.
Thank you so much"
ChIJ8Sn8OtQuQg0RTLsb7Z3QjU4,5,"I wish there were many more places like this. Totally recommended both for pastries (I have not tried a palm tree or a better donut than the ones here) and for bread (they have some great loaves) or for any emergency purchase that you may need. The owner couldn't be more charming, polite and helpful, you can tell he's still in the business because he likes what he does. Long live the neighborhood businesses of a lifetime!! Totally recommended."
ChIJ8Sn8OtQuQg0RTLsb7Z3QjU4,5,"A traditional bakery, with the BEST Chocolate Palm Trees in Madrid.

You should not miss these typical sites."

ChIJVzwyxEsvQg0R3HJNANhoApY,5,Argentinian style Empanadas de 5*. Better than others I have tried
ChIJVzwyxEsvQg0R3HJNANhoApY,5,AMAZING! Have ordered from them a few times (many different flavors) and always so delicious. The empanadas are perfectly filled and the taste is delightful. Zero complaints!
ChIJVzwyxEsvQg0R3HJNANhoApY,5,"The best Argentinian Empanadas in town. And I mean it, despite not being in Argentina the flavor is close to perfect."
ChIJVzwyxEsvQg0R3HJNANhoApY,5,Definitely worth to taste
ChIJVzwyxEsvQg0R3HJNANhoApY,5,
ChIJnaaiAZ4vQg0RNCStYwZn5Vk,5,"I really loved this restaurant.
The outdoor area is very cool. I really recommend sitting there if the weather allows it.
The food was superb. Everything was delicious.
The staff was very kind, especially Mikele. He was great."
ChIJnaaiAZ4vQg0RNCStYwZn5Vk,5,"The best pace around by a mile. Amazing food (artichokes and monk fish specially), good service and great atmosphere. Pricey, but it is definitely worth it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJnaaiAZ4vQg0RNCStYwZn5Vk,5,The food was delicious. We ate lomo de vaca con pimientos de padr√≥n and atun tarter.  They have a good wine menu also.  The service was excellent. I will return!
ChIJnaaiAZ4vQg0RNCStYwZn5Vk,5,Service and attention to detail was the best I‚Äôve experienced in Madrid.  Ambience also lovely.  Steak was really goods and cooked perfectly.   Definitely worth the visit even if not in central Madrid.  Also a Thai next door.
ChIJnaaiAZ4vQg0RNCStYwZn5Vk,4,We went on a working team lunch with a group of 10-12 people and ordered a bunch of good dishes! I couldn‚Äôt take more pictures because food was so good that I forgot to do it! I‚Äôm sharing some pictures of the place and some ‚ÄúTorreznos‚Äù (recommended btw)!
ChIJFyMO0ScpQg0RgNvgzAeo4P4,5,"This place is not too busy although they serve gourmet quality meals. I really enjoyed their signature dish. Service is excellent. Parking on the street, not many spots, but also not too busy. I can recommend it, and I will be back to try other meals."
ChIJFyMO0ScpQg0RgNvgzAeo4P4,4,This place is recommended on the michelin guide. Came here during the pandemic and they follow all recommendations. We had a table outside in their patio. Had a good meal. They even have a parking they'll open for you to park your car. The only but is the location which is pretty far away from any attraction in Madrid.
ChIJFyMO0ScpQg0RgNvgzAeo4P4,5,"Great place. We came with 4 had a lovely lunch, great food. Very friendly service. Well recommended this restaurant in a beautiful peaceful  corner of Madrid."
ChIJFyMO0ScpQg0RgNvgzAeo4P4,5,Delightful dinner in their beautiful terrace. First class service and excellent food!
ChIJFyMO0ScpQg0RgNvgzAeo4P4,4,Great meat!!!

ChIJDQLZmEMvQg0RxKyz1Y21m3E,2,Expensive and waiter very pushy

ChIJNya3PdYuQg0RaMbVnzslgcU,5,"Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the service of the menu of the day for only 11 euros.

ChIJNxN3X-wvQg0R2GYHnu6dckg,5,
ChIJEW0KVqgvQg0RkCd7CVA76m8,4,Delicious and fresh. This is not a fancy place but they serve some of the best Chinese soupy noodles (like ramen) in Madrid. Fresh noodle and have spicy and non spicy options are available. The beef noodle isn‚Äôt spicy as it seems. We also tried spicy beef skewers.
ChIJEW0KVqgvQg0RkCd7CVA76m8,5,"If you are tired with tapas after a long trip in Spain and is long for some chinese noodle soup, this one is highly recommended. Very delicious. The noodle is made on the site. Well services and the place is clean."
ChIJEW0KVqgvQg0RkCd7CVA76m8,5,Absolutely superb hand thrown noodles. Authentic starters. Best noodle I‚Äôve had outside of Beijing.
ChIJEW0KVqgvQg0RkCd7CVA76m8,4,Good chinese restaurant with a great variety of dishes. Seating outside on a sunny winter day was very nice.
ChIJEW0KVqgvQg0RkCd7CVA76m8,5,"Great food, and absolutely amazing scallion pancakes.
Handpulled noodles, highly recommended!"
ChIJWbnVKjkvQg0RJneFmSTXnV0,4,"Good oriental restaurant where the dishes are good and the quality too. If the price is not bad, totally recommended."
ChIJWbnVKjkvQg0RJneFmSTXnV0,5,"I think it's one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever tried. I have been going from time to time for more than 20 years and I have taken many people. Recommended, of course."
ChIJWbnVKjkvQg0RJneFmSTXnV0,1,"One of the worst Asian food restaurants.
Rancid and inedible foods. They should not be allowed to operate.
The service is poor and they didn't even apologize for the horrible food. I will never repeat it again."
ChIJWbnVKjkvQg0RJneFmSTXnV0,1,"THE WORST CHINESE RESTAURANT IN MADRID!
The food is preheated to know when it is done, not even the waitresses knew, exorbitant prices, small portions, in addition to the attention and education of the employees and the owner leaves much to be desired‚Ä¶.

We filed a complaint and we will never return!"
ChIJWbnVKjkvQg0RJneFmSTXnV0,5,"It has a daily menu for 11.90 with plenty of variety and good, abundant food and good atmosphere and service."

ChIJPSq9z48vQg0RBNtXa9tERWY,4,"I came for breakfast and the coffee  and toast where really nice. But even better the service, where I was attended by really charming and attentive server that was welcoming and very helpful"
ChIJPSq9z48vQg0RBNtXa9tERWY,3,"Food quality (sandwiches) were only so so. The environment is good for work or talk or reading. It was not busy and they have good comfortable seating, and also outdoor seating."
ChIJPSq9z48vQg0RBNtXa9tERWY,5,Chain of simple food around madrid. Reliable and yummy.
ChIJI4q42UkvQg0R6Bb7634AyL0,5,"It's a great place, very cozy and warm, nice and modern.
We visited it all week when we stayed in Madrid and lived nearby.

Genial and delicious breakfasts with good coffee and fresh orange juice.
Service at the highest level. The staff is kind and helpful, and always smile which makes this place nicer. Even if we didn't speak  Spanish very well there wasn't a problem to communicate.

The quality of food is top. It was always fresh and tasty, I didn't find anything that was bad, even kids (6  and 10 years old) complementing their portions.

I highly recommend that place for everyone staying near or just passing by.

Next time when I will visit Madrid I'm sure I'm going to visit MUSSU."
ChIJI4q42UkvQg0R6Bb7634AyL0,5,Great place in the Arturo Sofia neighborhood. Good food and great atmosphere.
ChIJI4q42UkvQg0R6Bb7634AyL0,5,Super friendly owner who called me a new cab after the previous one dropped me in the completely wrong place. Served me a nice relaxing tea at 0:45 too. Thanks again!!
ChIJI4q42UkvQg0R6Bb7634AyL0,5,"Amazing lunch at Mussu. I had the Ribeye 400g and it was delicious, highly recommend it!"
ChIJI4q42UkvQg0R6Bb7634AyL0,5,"Loved the atmosphere down at Mussu! Music was not loud, the terrace was lovely giving garden vibes. Servers were fantastic. We tried the ensaladilla rusa with gambones, alcachofas, and the tosta de chipiron en su tinta. On another occasion, I tried the pisto and their apple tart.
Food was great, with reasonable prices."
ChIJc-7pdX8pQg0RSaitVDgKauU,5,"I was there 2 weeks ago celebrating a friend's birthday and we had a fantastic time. The dinner was great and very fun because of the entertainment. Afterwards we stayed at the disco session until 5:30 in the morning. It is all in one, without having to move from one place to another. The attention of the staff is exquisite. I recommend it 100 percent."
ChIJc-7pdX8pQg0RSaitVDgKauU,5,"Spectacular place!! It's the second time I've gone and I would return without hesitation! Lots of entertainment throughout dinner and after! All the staff is very nice and the food is very good, good alcohol because you wake up the next day feeling great! Recommended 100x100"
ChIJc-7pdX8pQg0RSaitVDgKauU,5,"Excelente lugar y trato , estuve hace 1 semana celebrando la despedida de una amiga y lo pasamos muy bien cenamos con una animaci√≥n super divertida nos quedamos en sesi√≥n de discoteca hasta las 6 de la ma√±ana.
Lo recomiendo 100%."
ChIJc-7pdX8pQg0RSaitVDgKauU,5,"We had dinner for a joint bachelor's party on 03/22. Abundant food, very good entertainment, and ""la Male"" and ""la Paqui"" were in charge of livening up the evening and very concerned that we had a great time. Congratulations!"
ChIJc-7pdX8pQg0RSaitVDgKauU,5,"I was there 2 weeks ago celebrating a friend of mine's birthday and we had a great time, we had dinner with crazy entertainment and we stayed at the disco session until 5:30 in the morning. I recommend it 100 percent."
ChIJ6cwBIyovQg0R8adoHO_iaEI,4,"Nice owners and they give you little tapas with your drinks. I didn't want to have dinner there, but it is a very fresh place to spend your time, have some drinks and food. It has a place for events downstairs. Very original."
ChIJ6cwBIyovQg0R8adoHO_iaEI,5,"great menu, excellent service and low prices for such good quality food"
ChIJ6cwBIyovQg0R8adoHO_iaEI,5,Cute place with very tasty food at a very good price
ChIJ6cwBIyovQg0R8adoHO_iaEI,5,High quality manu with good price. Casual atmosphere.

ChIJ_2jsIyovQg0R6klZnSE945c,5,"A good place to have a drink with family or friends. Spanish fusion food of very good taste. The place is small but comfortable, well distributed. Very friendly waiters do not make you wait to serve you. The burgers are highly recommended."
ChIJ_2jsIyovQg0R6klZnSE945c,3,"It's a good place to have a few beers or drinks with friends. The owner must be passionate about surfing because of the name of the place and its decoration (see photos). To eat they have a menu of the day (Monday to Friday) or a la carte, although this is very limited and, furthermore, it consists of mostly unprepared dishes (toasts, hamburgers, etc.)."
ChIJ_2jsIyovQg0R6klZnSE945c,4,"Medium restaurant, it has two floors and is usually full on weekends, so I recommend booking. Varied menu but it is more for snacks than for lunch/dinner. I recommend croquettes (boletus and oxtail) and the only beef burger on the menu.
You can park well in the area, there is no charge. Nearby is the metro line 4 and several buses pass by, such as the 70 towards Plaza Castilla."
ChIJ_2jsIyovQg0R6klZnSE945c,4,Very good value for money.
ChIJY0-pfiIvQg0Rcb84n0EjEIA,5,Best pizza in the neighborhood. The caramelized onions one was our favorite !
ChIJY0-pfiIvQg0Rcb84n0EjEIA,5,"Great pizza, attitude and prices, as a tourist felt very warm welcomed! Will not regret having a great italian food!"
ChIJY0-pfiIvQg0Rcb84n0EjEIA,5,"Everything was good,the food excelent how i was treated thanks you Angel"
ChIJY0-pfiIvQg0Rcb84n0EjEIA,5,Excellent!! The best place..Cristobal the best ever!! So fantastic!!  His suggestions were fantastic... definitely honey with Pistachio
ChIJY0-pfiIvQg0Rcb84n0EjEIA,5,"Very good
Value for money
Tasty and cozy"
ChIJCao7H9AuQg0R02DV8oW7ozM,5,Everything was absolutely delicious. The prawns were so fresh and so easy to peel. The shells were so tasty with an amazing sauce. The lamb chops were to die for... Very friendly staff. Totally recomendable!
ChIJCao7H9AuQg0R02DV8oW7ozM,5,"Very good seafood but a bit pricey.
Dishes were relatively small for the price.
Had Gambas a la plancha, Gambas Al ajillo Navajas plancha which were all very good.
Also had percebes which could be best described as interesting.

Bottom line - Would recommend this place to seafood enthusiasts."
ChIJCao7H9AuQg0R02DV8oW7ozM,5,"Great and fast service.
Very tasty seafood."
ChIJCao7H9AuQg0R02DV8oW7ozM,5,"Some of the best seafood I ever had. Waiter gave lots of recommendations, all very good!
A bit pricey though (we paid about ‚Ç¨40pp for a lot of seafood and some wine)"
ChIJCao7H9AuQg0R02DV8oW7ozM,5,Fantastic fish and seafood restaurant! Highly recommend!
ChIJp7923NYpQg0RJAIYz8iLeQo,5,"Fast service, very good customer service, quality and abundant food. Recommended place quality price."
ChIJp7923NYpQg0RJAIYz8iLeQo,5,"They recommended this place to eat Chinese food and it was truly the best there is, I loved it!!!"
ChIJp7923NYpQg0RJAIYz8iLeQo,5,"6 of us went to dinner on the terrace and the truth is that we really liked it, the service was very good, they were very friendly and the food, especially the ceviche and the chaufa rice... we also ordered leche volteada for dessert and it was delicious, I recommend it to share."
ChIJp7923NYpQg0RJAIYz8iLeQo,5,Very good Peruvian food at an acceptable price. The menu has the most typical dishes of Peruvian food
ChIJp7923NYpQg0RJAIYz8iLeQo,5,Exquisite food and very good service. We have gone for breakfast and lunch and everything was great.
ChIJh7XycCkvQg0R96w0zp5Db-k,5,Super quick service with great quality Italian food.
ChIJh7XycCkvQg0R96w0zp5Db-k,5,"Everything is delicious and at a super competitive price.
Both Carlos and his wife are charming and strive to provide great customer service.
The chicken, the potatoes, the empanadas... all delicious. Furthermore, the treatment is close, familiar, of a lifetime. Of course, it is better to order by phone to be sure!
I once took 50 croquettes to a family party and they were so delicious!!!!!
Congratulations."
ChIJh7XycCkvQg0R96w0zp5Db-k,5,Today I went for the first time and I picked up some deviled eggs and a couple of roast chickens. Everything delicious. But the best of all has been the kindness and closeness of the people who have treated me. And you can see the dedication they put into what they cook. It's wonderful to find a place like this in these times when everything is so impersonal and crowded. So I couldn't be happier with my visit to this store. An absolute 10. I will return a thousand times to enjoy their dishes and their attention. Thank you so much!
ChIJh7XycCkvQg0R96w0zp5Db-k,5,"Very good place to buy chickens and takeout. Everything they offer is cooked by them and it is preferable to call to order it because they may run out of stock of some dishes.
What you will like most is the price, because for the homemade and traditional food they offer it has an excellent price.

I recommend:

- Roasted chicken
- Potato omelette - very very rich
- Stuffed eggs

I have yet to try the croquettes and the Russian salad.

The owners are charming and offer you the best.
We will surely order again."
ChIJh7XycCkvQg0R96w0zp5Db-k,5,"Small neighborhood place that only opens from Friday to Sunday, but be careful if you want a chicken that is mega delicious, you either reserve or you run out of chicken first thing in the morning because they are raffled off!! And if you are left behind you have nothing left because there is a waiting line and they sell all the stock!!! It must be for a reason!! 100% recommended, great but with very good quality-price ratio and the chicken is the best!!!!"
ChIJKbb3XDgvQg0R8OElB0hjsHI,5,"Tasty food, great service."
ChIJKbb3XDgvQg0R8OElB0hjsHI,5,"Heirs to the famous Frangus, difficult to beat: the grilled chicken is still delicious, they have added other meats, such as ribs and lamb and various starters. We will try everything!!"
ChIJKbb3XDgvQg0R8OElB0hjsHI,5,"Everything is delicious, they have a good menu, the chicken is Spectacular and a very good combination with the Lemon sauce, Everything Excellent and very delicious
Super recommended. When I return to Madrid I will not hesitate to visit them"
ChIJKbb3XDgvQg0R8OElB0hjsHI,5,Second time I order a roast chicken. Everything is very rich. There are also sausages and other things.
ChIJKbb3XDgvQg0R8OElB0hjsHI,1,"We bought 3 chickens and 2 portions of potatoes. The chickens are tiny, I have never seen such small chickens from a chicken rotisserie. The tiny portion of fries. The one with baked potatoes is better. Obviously very expensive for the quantity. To not repeat."
ChIJzTEqVKQvQg0RDfov-epg8FA,5,Good community place
ChIJzTEqVKQvQg0RDfov-epg8FA,5,"The picapollo is incredible, if you like Kentacky Fried Chicken (KFC) this is the homemade version (better). The fried seasoned on the outside and the super juicy and tender chicken on the inside. The empanadas (I tried the beef one) were incredible too."
ChIJzTEqVKQvQg0RDfov-epg8FA,5,"Casa lolo is as its name indicates, being at home, unparalleled treatment, good food, positivism, everything."
ChIJzTEqVKQvQg0RDfov-epg8FA,5,"Magnificent service, good appetizers.
An exceptional chicken pica. Terrace, dining room and you can park in double row. They put mushrooms and garter."
ChIJzTEqVKQvQg0RDfov-epg8FA,5,"Camera very efficient and very professional, I would always recommend it"
ChIJVVXpEtkuQg0RORiD01h7hSs,5,"Nice spot. Easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. Handwritten menu with 4 starter and 4 main options. Also came with a drink (beer, wine, water, etc.), a basket of bread, and a dessert/coffee at the end. All for 10‚Ç¨ cash. The owner was super patient and kind."
ChIJVVXpEtkuQg0RORiD01h7hSs,1,"We went with a discount from the Fork, which they did not want to apply to us. Outdated, neglected and vintage place. The low quality of comina does not correspond to its average price. Friendly waiter, but he did not apply the stipulated discount to us. To not return"
ChIJVVXpEtkuQg0RORiD01h7hSs,4,"26 de Palermo is a 70's style bar-restaurant. This is where its charm lies.  Hidden in a corner of the street itself, it has a large interior room with many tables and two small outdoor terraces. Menus at ‚Ç¨11, which include wine with homemade or another drink of your choice. Recommended to nostalgic people and those who want to eat decently at a very reasonable price."
ChIJVVXpEtkuQg0RORiD01h7hSs,5,"A good place to eat, very good quality/price ratio, the guy who served me was very friendly, healthy food and good service, highly recommended, ‚Ç¨12 menu"
ChIJVVXpEtkuQg0RORiD01h7hSs,5,"A REAL place, a good service, with very good people and JOSE, a professional of those who no longer exist. (The kitchen and bar staff are very, very good. Like being at home)
I came here from Ireland to MAD and they gave me a meal from LA HOSTIA at 4:15 p.m.

In the end, we decided on some tripe as the centerpiece of the table, and then a mixed salad and chistoria. Everything is very delicious and the tripe is like grandma's.

The second courses were very delicious, rabas that are rabas, and not those things that appear to be rabas. They are not the rabas of the Santa Maria port, but they are very good.

And the beef wasn't one of those that taste like shoe soles, it was tender.

Oh, AND THE RATIONS AS GOD INSTRUCTS. I HAVEN'T LEFT FOOD ON THE PLATE FOR A LONG TIME.

I hope this review helps those who, like me, trust this and have some mistrust to not be comfortable or satisfied.

I spent 12.50 on the menu and look what a piece of cake I'm going to get. And everything included water, bread and wine. And to choose between coffee or dessert."
ChIJ23jW_touQg0RbciahwjwWeQ,4,This a very traditional churreria. Their churros and porras are very fresh and tasty. Their hot chocolate is not as good but in general is okay. The staff is friendly and tries to serve you quickly. I would definitely go back for more churros in winter.
ChIJ23jW_touQg0RbciahwjwWeQ,5,Local coffee with some local things to grab onn the way. Loved their chorus
ChIJ23jW_touQg0RbciahwjwWeQ,5,Typical local cafe. Fresh churros. And not so sweet/sticky chocolate which was nice.
ChIJ23jW_touQg0RbciahwjwWeQ,5,Attentive staff and good churros
ChIJ23jW_touQg0RbciahwjwWeQ,5,churros
ChIJLfn_ZtkuQg0RAhxXp-5pAms,2,Closed now
ChIJLfn_ZtkuQg0RAhxXp-5pAms,1,It is closed and they continue to receive reservations from other countries.
ChIJLfn_ZtkuQg0RAhxXp-5pAms,1,It has been closed for a long time
ChIJLfn_ZtkuQg0RAhxXp-5pAms,3,The people who run the inn are very helpful.

ChIJ3SBn5SsvQg0Rri45Lb2zRMY,5,"Highly recommended family brewery! We went for breakfast on a Sunday by chance. Everything was closed in the surrounding area and it was the only bar open. Great coffee in base, delicious bar bread toast. Many breakfast options and at a good price, ‚Ç¨2.50/person. Very pleasant attention, everything ventilated and clean between client and client. It also has a small terrace. A success!"
ChIJ3SBn5SsvQg0Rri45Lb2zRMY,5,"The best are the tortilla skewers and the bars with tomato and ham. It is ideal for breakfast. Plus, the family that runs it is lovely."
ChIJ3SBn5SsvQg0Rri45Lb2zRMY,5,"Homemade neighborhood bar of a lifetime. Phenomenal attention from all the staff (Susana standing out) delicious and homemade food.
Very good price."
ChIJ3SBn5SsvQg0Rri45Lb2zRMY,5,An exceptional traditional bar. The waiters are very friendly and the food comes out fast and delicious! Very good atmosphere!
ChIJ3SBn5SsvQg0Rri45Lb2zRMY,5,"It has the charm of a neighborhood bar, where they serve you by name. Homemade food, very delicious!  The calluses are..."
ChIJ-aL418uHQQ0R993aS4J2-68,5,I went many years to swim in their pools. My mother was a telephone employee. I hope they open it again one day. The best sports center in all of Madrid was.
ChIJ-aL418uHQQ0R993aS4J2-68,5,"I agree with all the comments.  I went with my parents and my sister when we were little, every weekend. There I almost certainly learned to ride a bike and catch tadpoles, play tennis and a lot of things.
I hope it opens again soon."
ChIJ-aL418uHQQ0R993aS4J2-68,5,It's a shame. The city council has to recover it. Heritage cannot be lost.
ChIJ-aL418uHQQ0R993aS4J2-68,1,"My daughter went into the Manzanares two days ago and when she got out of the water a rash began to appear all over her skin in the form of pimples with red pus resulting from the amount of parasites that are in there, the river is a shame, not even the three-eyed fish from the Simpsons can survive there, now my daughter does not even want to take a shower because she is afraid of the water, you are murderers for keeping the river like this, you have left me the girl that you are calling me to record the new from the shameless exorcist."
ChIJ-aL418uHQQ0R993aS4J2-68,5,"I spent half my life there playing basketball, racquetball and swimming in their pools. All my childhood memories are from this place and nothing remains of what it was. It breaks my heart to see him like this."
ChIJuymn8nqHQQ0RddjjDX0Kd4M,5,Brutal restaurant. They treated our allergies very carefully. Great detail when coming to Spain
ChIJuymn8nqHQQ0RddjjDX0Kd4M,2,"The service was terrible and disorganized.
The food was not good as well except the sushi.

Overall I was quite disappointed."
ChIJuymn8nqHQQ0RddjjDX0Kd4M,5,Great afternoon of horseracing under the Mediterranean sun
ChIJuymn8nqHQQ0RddjjDX0Kd4M,5,Top the best professionals
ChIJuymn8nqHQQ0RddjjDX0Kd4M,5,"Very good atmosphere to have a drink, the cocktails were great, I loved the bloody mary. The food was also great, especially the prawns and sushi, but there wasn't a dish that I didn't like, everything was great. I will definitely repeat a lot this summer. The place is very beautiful, it has beautiful views of the sunset."
ChIJq6o6LeApQg0RX3qKJ03BF1Q,1,"This was the worst experience in Madrid
Never had such bad food and bad service"
ChIJq6o6LeApQg0RX3qKJ03BF1Q,4,This restaurant inside eauro stars Monte real hotel it's OK I like it have nice and romantic very the dinner.
ChIJq6o6LeApQg0RX3qKJ03BF1Q,4,"Among the starter options, I really liked the Roasted Pumpkin Cream, simply delicious and one of the best I tried, with just a touch of olive oil. I liked it much more than their Rag√º al Oporto. Among the seconds, their low-temperature fish is good. And among the desserts they serve there is everything from ice cream to fruit, but I prefer the lime mousse. Among all, the attention of the waiters is the best, they are very friendly and are very attentive to what you need."
ChIJq6o6LeApQg0RX3qKJ03BF1Q,1,"The Caesar salad only had the name: a mix of lettuce with cabbage, without cheese, without sauce, without croutons, with bacon and cherry tomatoes... in short, Caesar only had the name. They put the sauce and croutons on me after ordering them... but the most unpleasant thing is that at 10:45 p.m., I order dessert and they tell me that the kitchen is closed. A restaurant must warn its customers when it is going to close the kitchen and even more so when there were still 15 minutes left. Furthermore, the dessert usually has very little preparation, that answer is not admissible. The waitress, upon telling her that there were still 15 minutes left, reluctantly brought me the dessert menu and my hunger went away. There is no more unpleasant feeling than eating in a place where they do not want to serve you and make you feel comfortable, but rather make you eat quickly and leave as soon as possible. Review the hospitality school classes if they took them. A hotel of this category does not deserve this terrible service."
ChIJq6o6LeApQg0RX3qKJ03BF1Q,5,"Food for 10, but the price is a little high, perhaps that's what you pay in the capital."
ChIJ9cXJKWuJQQ0RgI76XsCu07A,4,"I had not been to a Mexican in years, plus it does pasta and Pizza for the kids."
ChIJ9cXJKWuJQQ0RgI76XsCu07A,1,"We went today, Saturday, at 7, which was the opening hours on Google. Surprisingly, it wasn't open. We called twice and until they answered, they told us that they opened at 8. We made time because we had already come here once before and everything was great but we arrived and the girl who served us didn't feel like anything. He didn't give us the menu until we asked for it. The menu had a lot of what we wanted and what we were going for crossed out. There was only us in the place and until they turned on a light to dim it further, at least 10 minutes passed. We asked for a bucket of beer, surprise there was none, a juice for a small child and they didn't have it either. We ordered the taco tasting which was neither fu nor fa because they heated it up in the micro! We ordered 2 burritos that were not burritos but fajita and I say this with certainty because I have been there more times and what they served me was not what it had been the previous times. It was a very toasted fajita that was almost burnt and the birria burrito was served with the birria because it was shiny because of its absence this time. They didn't bring you any salt or salt, we took it from the bar like the spicy one too. According to a sign there was a 2x1 for soft drinks and beer and they forgot the 2x1 at the time of the bill. We ordered a Margarita and the girl told us that the slushy machine was not on and that the Margarita would not be available for 15 minutes. We told him it was fine and after a while he came over to tell us that Margarita would take longer and that he was warning us so that we wouldn't complain after he was already warning us, all of this in an arrogant and not at all friendly way that in the face of the public you have to take care of the customers because if not, they won't come back and your business closes! Anyway, we asked for the bill and until we got up to look for the girl, they didn't charge us, we could have left just like that. Very bad unpleasant experience especially because of the waitress' bad manners throughout. I have been to this place at noon and there is another girl who serves you very well, very friendly, I recommend things to you or she tells you what they carry but this girl does not. I hope you read it and learn. There are better ways. Furthermore, the terrace is not even set up."
ChIJ9cXJKWuJQQ0RgI76XsCu07A,5,"We ate very well in this place that is prettier inside than it appears on the outside. It is authentic Mexican cuisine and small, super tasty tacos like they are served there. If you are looking for things full of cheddar, this is not your place, therefore, being a neighborhood establishment, a pleasant surprise.

Fast and friendly service, good cold Mexican beers, delicious michelada. All good!"
ChIJ9cXJKWuJQQ0RgI76XsCu07A,5,"Since we discovered it, our favorite Mexican in the neighborhood. The food was very good and at a totally reasonable price. For two people between ‚Ç¨35-40.
The treatment from the staff was great, the girl who serves us is usually very nice to us and our dog. With how hot it is, they have always put their little bowl of water in it."
ChIJ9cXJKWuJQQ0RgI76XsCu07A,5,"No, well, what a cool place, dad! From the moment you arrive, they welcome you with a motherly atmosphere and the aroma of freshly made tortillas.
We also ordered some chelas that were very plump.
The girls who work as waitresses serve you with all their might.
Without a doubt we will return because as my comadre said, without chamoy there is no joy!"
ChIJGV52_acpQg0Ro1UKQXno77o,4,We visited D.Spot in December 2021 after playing tennis in Puerta de Hierro with my wife. We needed some good food and this place offered exactly that. Healthy and comfy food after doing some sport. We recommend the Angus Burger and the Bonito salad with tomatoes. As dessert my wife had a Lemon Pie. Very good experience!
ChIJGV52_acpQg0Ro1UKQXno77o,5,Love my food and I went there alone but I don't feel alone since everyone working in the restaurant were so attentive. I'll take a photo when I get  back
ChIJGV52_acpQg0Ro1UKQXno77o,4,Very nice cafeteria with good employees in a calm area ... everything was excellent
ChIJGV52_acpQg0Ro1UKQXno77o,5,Great place for dinner and very good service.
ChIJGV52_acpQg0Ro1UKQXno77o,5,Nice place to relax with nice terrace.
ChIJr7jDWugpQg0RPMcmE76BjHs,3,"This is one of the only places available late at night. Some of the dishes aren't available at night. Basically everything available are sandwiches. The chicken was dry and felt old, the veg and chorizo was all good, the bread was nice. The food is quite cheap and starters were brought to us for free without us knowing that there were starters. The overall amount of food was quite a lot for the price.

It was full and very loud but it was a Saturday night, the staff spoke fast and barely glanced in our direction before walking off so it wasn't clear what was said at all times. Service was slow, someone would pop back around every 10-15 minutes. There was food and rubbish on the floor. It was even a slight challenge to get the bill and pay. Ultimately this is a cheap and low quality place but it is open late if you're hungry or want alcohol."
ChIJr7jDWugpQg0RPMcmE76BjHs,1,"We waited 1,5 hours then left because nobody came to take our order. Don‚Äôt come if there are a lot of people. The waitress said, ‚Äúshe does not have time to take our order‚Äù."
ChIJr7jDWugpQg0RPMcmE76BjHs,5,"Great place to eat with some friends or colleagues. The food is good and cheap and the place is filled with locals. Even as a tourist, you're welcomed with a smile. Knowing a bit of Spanish won't hurt, though ;)"
ChIJr7jDWugpQg0RPMcmE76BjHs,1,"Very bad service, waited an hour and a half for a table while people got in and had one immediately. Also the ‚Äútapas‚Äù were cold and greasy, and the general state of the place was disgusting."
ChIJr7jDWugpQg0RPMcmE76BjHs,5,"Really friendly staff, excellent & generous tapas with our beers, we‚Äôll happily return."
ChIJb1fXesEpQg0RMj-uXTxTphU,5,Burger La terraza was really nice! I asked for it well done and it came out perfect! Also let you have you dog out on the terrace.
ChIJb1fXesEpQg0RMj-uXTxTphU,5,"The best broken eggs I've ever had. They also have an omelet with blood sausage and caramelized onion, which you can't leave without trying. I will be back!!!"
ChIJb1fXesEpQg0RMj-uXTxTphU,4,"Today we went to have a tortilla skewer, which they advertise as one of the best. They have two types, truffle and normal.
Both were delicious, and the truffle one surprised me because it tasted pretty much like what it promises.

The very calm atmosphere, the well-kept decoration and the very attentive staff. They told us that they are going to launch their brand soon, and they will surely go very far.

To give it a but, and why I don't give it 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è is because, in my opinion, the price is a little high. Two tortilla skewers, a sparkling water and a normal water ‚Ç¨14. It didn't hurt me to pay them because it is an experience and the tortillas were very good, but that price may not be understood by everyone, since in other places (without disparaging this one) with a recognized reputation for their tortilla, they set a price of ‚Ç¨4.30 and the amount is more generous.

As a global experience, very good, I would repeat."
ChIJb1fXesEpQg0RMj-uXTxTphU,5,"If you are a tortilla lover, this is your place. The croquettes are also recommended. This time we ordered salad and cachopo and for dessert cheesecake with strawberry topping. And recommended too :)"
ChIJb1fXesEpQg0RMj-uXTxTphU,4,"It is the second time we go, this time we finally tried their famous potato omelette and the truth is that it is delicious. The terrace is spacious and is in a very quiet area. We will return to continue trying more dishes."
ChIJwSWBmcEpQg0Rf5x0ORBz9ts,5,Excellent foor and excellent staff. The way the food is presented to customer is in such a way that makes the consumer an absolute lover of the design and taste of everything. Pretty recommendable.
ChIJwSWBmcEpQg0Rf5x0ORBz9ts,2,"The restaurant is a simple bar with low quality furniture. Customer service leaves a lot to be desired, as they take a long time to respond, which is frustrating.
The atmosphere is cold and the bathroom is an igloo.
However, the quality of the food is good. If they improved customer service and renewed the atmosphere a little, the experience would be much more pleasant."
ChIJwSWBmcEpQg0Rf5x0ORBz9ts,5,"The place is not very big, but it surprised me in a good way. Menu with suggestions and several homemade spoon dishes. I loved that they changed plates and cutlery for each dish. The treatment of the waiters is phenomenal."
ChIJwSWBmcEpQg0Rf5x0ORBz9ts,1,"Unfortunately the service has not been good, the waiters select very well who and how they serve. Which seems in very bad taste to me. They give a judicious opinion about the order and do not take into account the needs of the diners (in our case we went with a 2-year-old baby). No one likes to feel like they are treated differently. Regarding the food, the mussels were good, but the risotto was not.
I won't be back üò°"
ChIJwSWBmcEpQg0Rf5x0ORBz9ts,3,"Nice restaurant. Good service and delicious food. For me, I like a bit of a fair amount. Prices in the area. A little high. We will return to try the croquettes and tripe."
ChIJt6mqIeopQg0RvTwRXTRkLPQ,5,Excellent Paella! It was full of seafood and chicken. The fried potatoes in sauce was also very good. The staff was super friendly and spoke some English. As a foreigner I am not always welcomed into local restaurants but felt wanted here. It was busy with locals coming and going and had a great atmosphere. Eating here has been a highlight of my time in Madrid. Thank you!
ChIJt6mqIeopQg0RvTwRXTRkLPQ,5,"Everything is delicious, homemade and very fresh."
ChIJt6mqIeopQg0RvTwRXTRkLPQ,5,"If you have the opportunity to go to eat, don't hesitate. Excellent staff, very familiar and delicious food. I've been there several times and I've always had a fantastic meal!"
ChIJt6mqIeopQg0RvTwRXTRkLPQ,5,Good homemade food and good treatment. Without a doubt recommended
ChIJt6mqIeopQg0RvTwRXTRkLPQ,5,"We ate menu of the day.
Very rich, good service, good price.
We will repeat"
ChIJQU5omOkpQg0RJi9efPOjTeA,5,"Very helpful waiter. My Spanish is almost zero and he didn't speak English but tried very hard. Lovely meal. Reasonable selection on the specials menu.  Superb value. 3 courses, bottle of water, bottle of wine, ‚Ç¨34.00. Hard to beat."
ChIJQU5omOkpQg0RJi9efPOjTeA,5,"No fuss, great cocido completo. Excellent service and friendly staff. All the dishes look great."
ChIJQU5omOkpQg0RJi9efPOjTeA,5,"An incredible experience - the food, service, and atmosphere! Just stumbled upon this place but really appreciated the hospitality! Definitely recommend üëçüèº"
ChIJQU5omOkpQg0RJi9efPOjTeA,3,"Seemed fun and busy, but no tapa with our beer."
ChIJQU5omOkpQg0RJi9efPOjTeA,5,Nice and typical bario-bar.
ChIJEVQanb8pQg0R5wuMrcAgdMU,5,"A quiet, family restaurant, with healthy and exquisite homemade food. The Thursday stew is delicious!                               Magnificently attended to by its owner, Luis."
ChIJEVQanb8pQg0R5wuMrcAgdMU,5,"It's like eating at home and having your mother or grandmother make the food for you. With the difference that Luis takes care of you, who is a very nice and attentive guy. 10 out of 10"
ChIJEVQanb8pQg0R5wuMrcAgdMU,5,"The restaurant where cooking is done with the most care and affection in the entire City of Poets and part of Abroad. Luis (living room) and Santi and Jose (kitchen), three professionals like the tops of three pines."
ChIJEVQanb8pQg0R5wuMrcAgdMU,5,"Homemade, healthy and very delicious food. Very good atmosphere, very good service and spectacular food is not enough. 100% recommended."
ChIJEVQanb8pQg0R5wuMrcAgdMU,5,"Traditional, delicious food like that at your mother's or grandmother's house.  The beans were tender and tasty, the rabbit with garlic was super good and with real fries and for dessert... pears in wine!!! Exquisite. For less than ‚Ç¨13 with wine and coffee!!! If it were next to a highway the surrounding area would be full of trucks!!! Family treatment and customers who know each other by name.  Few places like this remain.
Now that I think about it, I shouldn't have gone on so much, maybe the next day I'll run out of a table."
ChIJR5TJKnkpQg0RWsjMkaPDRvM,5,On of th√©  best spanish dishes we hav√© tried here in Madrid.Its a superb exp√©rience.Chef Abdel is an amazing person.Salute to his skill and best service.
ChIJR5TJKnkpQg0RWsjMkaPDRvM,4,The free tapas with a drink ' have disappeared since new management took over.  But the patio garden surrounded by plants remains a big draw..
ChIJR5TJKnkpQg0RWsjMkaPDRvM,5,Very tasty Spanish food and great service
ChIJR5TJKnkpQg0RWsjMkaPDRvM,4,"They have chocolate con churros, and porras. Very nice."
ChIJR5TJKnkpQg0RWsjMkaPDRvM,4,Nice terrace and nice food
ChIJC_efUr8pQg0RGpJ0oIq3PgQ,1,The owner of the bar use to smoke inside the bar something that it has been prohibited since 2005 and when we told him that he should not do it we got a really impolite response!!!
ChIJC_efUr8pQg0RGpJ0oIq3PgQ,5,Bueno!!!
ChIJC_efUr8pQg0RGpJ0oIq3PgQ,5,"Traditional neighborhood bar.
Very good terrace. It is very comfortable and if you have children it is very comfortable because there are no hassles of cars.
In addition, the waitresses are very attentive and pleasant."
ChIJC_efUr8pQg0RGpJ0oIq3PgQ,4,"Right place to have a beer. The terrace is good, pleasant. The correct waiters, nothing to highlight. I would put a few more portions that weren't fried or sausage, there are few options."
ChIJC_efUr8pQg0RGpJ0oIq3PgQ,1,"I don't know how to explain it without offending... Normal bar, few customers, terrace in summer, but don't expect a good gesture or for the waitress to come out to the terrace to charge you, who seems to bother her every time you talk to her."
ChIJ5a44ETEpQg0R1kntsFtsnAU,5,Very good food and customer service was perfect
ChIJ5a44ETEpQg0R1kntsFtsnAU,5,"Thank you very much family, the tortilla is delicious.
I recommend this Bar, small but very comfortable."
ChIJ5a44ETEpQg0R1kntsFtsnAU,5,Small neighborhood bar Right in Ricote Square. The owners are very nice and willing. The prices are average and the place is good although it could be decorated a little warmer. But what stood out is the kindness of the owner. Recommended for a drink.
ChIJ5a44ETEpQg0R1kntsFtsnAU,5,"Typical place that you don't count on, but you enter and it's a traditional neighborhood bar. Unbeatable treatment, the service is totally neighborhood, absolute closeness and generosity. It's very cool to arrive at a place and feel at home..."
ChIJ5a44ETEpQg0R1kntsFtsnAU,5,Small but super cozy. They make you feel at home. I recommend the chicharrita to drink and snack with friends. Great site
ChIJoxEWqeopQg0RAvKJi7BC3Us,5,"Nice, friendly service on a Sunday night. Pizza a tiny, tiny bit expensive, but when they came out they were big & very rich in flavour & ingredients which is exactly what you want; my favourite in Madrid so far (after two months). Good wine too. We will return."
ChIJoxEWqeopQg0RAvKJi7BC3Us,5,Great pizzas and they did an order of 17 pizzas on record time!
ChIJoxEWqeopQg0RAvKJi7BC3Us,5,"PIzza is great, best I've tried in Madrid and the service is fast and good!"
ChIJoxEWqeopQg0RAvKJi7BC3Us,5,Great experience!
ChIJoxEWqeopQg0RAvKJi7BC3Us,3,Nice beers
ChIJKRsf7hQpQg0R3v9S-1IADQ8,5,"It's my usual breakfast place.
I love their tortilla and barrita (toastada con tomate).
I also recommend their fresh juices and coffees.

If you're here for a meal, they serve sumptuous menu de Dia and other options.
And of course, you can always pop-in for a beer or a drink."
ChIJKRsf7hQpQg0R3v9S-1IADQ8,5,Authentic place
ChIJKRsf7hQpQg0R3v9S-1IADQ8,4,"The best thing about this bar is its location, with a terrace facing the midday sun that delights the crowd in autumn and winter, and the staff, fast, attentive and very friendly (without ever being invasive). The tapas they serve with the beer are also very delicious and the portions are generous and at a good price (I have never had lunch or dinner there, which is why I only assign three stars to the ""Food"" section). Of course, I recommend that ""the property"" (that's what the owners are called now, right?, at least in football) to hire a good photographer for the Google photos; Those seen so far, rather than attract, scare. :-))"
ChIJKRsf7hQpQg0R3v9S-1IADQ8,5,"We were eating on Sunday, the special menu they have, rice with lobster and entrecote for the main course. EVERYTHING GOOD! The treatment by the staff and √Ålvaro was professional and close, we will repeat for sure!"
ChIJKRsf7hQpQg0R3v9S-1IADQ8,1,Bad attention. We waited 20 minutes for our beer to be brought out to the terrace. They need much more staff or at least more efficient ones.
ChIJOUkB84UpQg0RnDqd9MaNLw0,5,"Great Neapolitan style pizzas, spectacular dough"
ChIJOUkB84UpQg0RnDqd9MaNLw0,5,"One of the best pizzas I've ever had.
I recommend them
Especially the 5 cheeses.
And what we have tried this week are the hot dogs, the best and largest I have ever had in my life (they are quite big)"
ChIJOUkB84UpQg0RnDqd9MaNLw0,5,"There are several that I have tried and they are always delicious, the dough is very good and everything is very natural, it is not fast and filthy food.
Furthermore, it is a pleasure to be served and always attended to with a smile. It doesn't happen in other places unfortunately.
Another point in favor: they are very well priced.
I recommend it 1000%."
ChIJOUkB84UpQg0RnDqd9MaNLw0,4,"The dough is very rich and good service.
As a downside, there were pieces of bacon that we in particular like much more cooked."
ChIJOUkB84UpQg0RnDqd9MaNLw0,5,"The pizzas are too good, great service, 100% recommended"
ChIJHQP3D74pQg0RYxWBBjjaAGQ,5,
ChIJJ_1JGr4pQg0RS4_5Igs8FAw,5,"Homemade menu, very good quality and price. It is eaten quickly and delicious. German takes great care of you, as always."
ChIJJ_1JGr4pQg0RS4_5Igs8FAw,5,"The best bar I have ever been to, simple but with 10 service and 20 food. Simply perfect"
ChIJJ_1JGr4pQg0RS4_5Igs8FAw,5,"Good people from all the life of the neighborhood, good food, good family treatment and Madrid. Greetings from Talav√°n!"
ChIJJ_1JGr4pQg0RS4_5Igs8FAw,1,"I don't recommend it
Bad attention.
The waitress had a bad face, changing the customers' places (tables)
They are not clear with the prices
The squid is thin and full of flour and fat.
Bad experience."
ChIJJ_1JGr4pQg0RS4_5Igs8FAw,5,"A typical bar, with homemade food, very fast and efficient waiters. The terrace is very good in the afternoon, it is in the shade. Generous portions and very well priced. Advisable!"
ChIJsZw4y6IpQg0RJKGzFltDJy0,5,"Casa Pepe, fondly dubbed ""Pepe el Guarro"" by locals, exudes a charmingly rustic ambiance that instantly transports you into the heart of authentic Madrid.

ChIJsZw4y6IpQg0RJKGzFltDJy0,5,"100% recommended to go for drinks!

When you order one ca√±a, you will get 10 small fried chicken legs! Can you believe it?
If you order second ca√±a, they will offer you another tapa such as fried orejas!! And price is super reasonable!"
ChIJsZw4y6IpQg0RJKGzFltDJy0,5,Wow. This place has some amazing food. I went on Wednesday and got the Cosido Madrile√±o. You must order this and the beer was very cold.
ChIJsZw4y6IpQg0RJKGzFltDJy0,3,"Went here for great reviews of closest friends, but actually got disappointed..it s true I went over Saturday lunch crowded time, however the waitress has been quite unhelpful of an awkward situation. In any case, the so popular chicken wings free during tapas were dry, and the rest of the meal, torreznos dry and chipirones chewy with unsalted and no spicy or salda enough on both salads and potatoes sides.. beer s ok and terrace (if u are lucky enough to get a spot) pleasant. Portion over price s good, and atmosphere cheerful; won t recommend overall for groups, it s very casual sitting if not reserved sits"
ChIJsZw4y6IpQg0RJKGzFltDJy0,5,Chicken wings and torreznos it‚Äôs a must! Bar mostly for the locals serves simple but delicious food daily. Staff are friendly with fair prices
ChIJ668Vyb0pQg0RNGORlamwKBo,1,"It takes more than an hour to serve food at home, so you can expect it to come colder than just taken out of the refrigerator. We won't order again because on top of that they are liars. They tell you that it left when your delivery time was 11:10 p.m. and 45 minutes later they still hadn't arrived and it was supposedly on its way. Arrival at home 15 minutes from local."
ChIJ668Vyb0pQg0RNGORlamwKBo,1,"I ordered 4 pieces of chicken and they brought me 4 peppers hahaha. It's just that I burst out laughing. It's worth ordering just to laugh at the surprise they can bring you. We thought the nachos were normal and they are from a Mercadona bag with a Mercadona cheese sauce.

Alas... let's eat it."
ChIJ668Vyb0pQg0RNGORlamwKBo,1,"Average roast chicken on the verge of being bad, I don't know where they get it from with the grill, but on top of that the attention is terrible.
When I answered the bell, I heard the delivery guy saying something and when he came up, he didn't say a single word!!! He didn't even respond to the hello, good night, and when I asked him how much it was because he didn't remember, he pointed to the ticket without saying a word. ...and of course he didn't say goodbye either. I won't ask again"
ChIJ668Vyb0pQg0RNGORlamwKBo,1,"I give it one star because you can't give it less. Terrible experience.

You ask for the food and they don't bring it, you call and a Chinese man answers you who doesn't understand any Spanish, so you can't make yourself understood.

The bad rib and the chicken more.

I do not recommend it and I will never order from this site again."
ChIJ668Vyb0pQg0RNGORlamwKBo,1,16 euros for a packaged rib from Mercadona. I don't think I have ever felt so scammed making a simple home delivery order.
ChIJeyxFtL0pQg0RpqcMrGp0nbo,3,"For various reasons I was in the area starving and found this takeaway place. It was around 3:30 p.m. and the door was open, blocked by a freezer, and two people were inside. It looks a bit messy but I ordered vegetables with shrimp and it was done in 4 minutes. You can't eat there or even almost go in but it's fast. The food was good lots of prawns."
ChIJeyxFtL0pQg0RpqcMrGp0nbo,5,"All very good. I have always ordered by phone so I can't say anything about the place. Everything has arrived correctly on time the first time and I have never had to complain about anything. There was only one day when the spring rolls were a bit over the top with the pepper and were a little bit spicy and my little one said Rita should eat them, but the other days we have found them great and we have ordered many times, more than 10 and we will continue to repeat them."
ChIJeyxFtL0pQg0RpqcMrGp0nbo,5,"If you are a resident or tourist living in this area, I highly recommend this Chinese restaurant. Since my bank card cannot complete online payment, I finally ordered the meal successfully after communicating on the phone. The boss asked the courier to bring the POS machine to the door to swipe the card. The matter was solved very conveniently and efficiently. The food was also very fresh and delicious. A large bottle of Coke was also given as a gift. The attitude was super good and it was really convenient. I wish the boss a prosperous business."
ChIJeyxFtL0pQg0RpqcMrGp0nbo,4,One of the few Chinese food places in the area that is open late at night. I found the food very good. My only problem is that the lack of communication slightly damages the experience when ordering.
ChIJeyxFtL0pQg0RpqcMrGp0nbo,4,"We tried to give it a try despite the bad reviews it had and it wasn't as bad as it seemed. Yes, it is true that the bag comes quite oily, but better oil in the bag than in the food... The fried foods came rolled in paper to avoid that. The 3 delicious noodles were very good and lots of shrimp, the beef could have been a little more tender but good, and the chicken was tender and tasty. Regarding the quantity, the typical round taper to burst. One rice, for example, is enough for two people.  It's not bad, there are much worse Chinese ones."
ChIJV8on8LwpQg0RFX4SI3KzZmQ,5,I have ordered delivery several times through Uber eats and I am very happy. Delicious food typical of any Chinese you can find. They have good offers. I recommend it
ChIJV8on8LwpQg0RFX4SI3KzZmQ,1,"Bad treatment of customers, bad food, and very unpleasant place"
ChIJV8on8LwpQg0RFX4SI3KzZmQ,2,"I was not happy, I ordered a tray of sushi and it was dry apart from being super small and some noodles with the 3 delicious ones and they had no flavor they were very white they had no color I spent ‚Ç¨30 on those two things and I didn't like it nothing"
ChIJV8on8LwpQg0RFX4SI3KzZmQ,5,"one of those places where they make you feel like a lifetime :-).
I especially like the way they serve you, they make you feel like they've known you your whole life.
The food accompanies the attention they give and dedicate to you.
It is very affordable."
ChIJV8on8LwpQg0RFX4SI3KzZmQ,5,"Great place to go for lunch or dinner.
The owners are super friendly and always welcome you with a smile and are attentive to you at all times.
Food fresh and made at the moment."
ChIJ75s5q78pQg0RJPpYsyUfZxs,5,"Never had an issue ordering their food through Glovo. Sushi is fresh, and food is good. I specifically love their yakisoba con verduras, it‚Äôs tasty."
ChIJ75s5q78pQg0RJPpYsyUfZxs,5,Good
ChIJ75s5q78pQg0RJPpYsyUfZxs,1,"Doorman of the Camino de Ganipanes 1 urbanization. hahaha, what's up with that man? As soon as he sees an Amazon delivery driver arrive, etc., does he hide? Who pays this man? He can be a little nicer since he is a DOORMAN. That is what it is about serving people at the service of urbanization.  They should fire him. You can't live with bad-tempered people who look down on everyone who arrives. He was in the wrong profession. Bad 0."
ChIJ75s5q78pQg0RJPpYsyUfZxs,4,"The maki and sushi are very delicious, especially the salmon ones. üç£ I also really like the Thai style red curry there with white rice. They have their own sushi chef with their own preparation area and a traditional Chinese kitchen. It is no longer a restaurant. It is to take away or order food."
ChIJ75s5q78pQg0RJPpYsyUfZxs,3,"I ordered a ramen for ‚Ç¨12.90. They delivered very quickly but the flavor seemed like just plain chicken broth.
Overpriced for what it really was, but I would try other dishes again."
ChIJIUwd8JUpQg0RLym5ZWEpgY8,4,Wonderful place clean and good taste and I love Sushi my favourite meal. üòã
ChIJIUwd8JUpQg0RLym5ZWEpgY8,2,"The quality has been declining greatly and the price is excessive.

Months ago we ordered pokes at home several times and each time the amount of ingredients and sauce was less, to the point of having to pay extra to have the same amount of sauce as at the beginning. We stop asking.

We ordered again today to give it another chance and:
1. The sashimi pieces looked like sirloins
2. The tuna meat in the makis was destroyed
3. The poke sauce was not enough
4. I'm not entirely sure, but as far as I know, the avocado roll doesn't have to have surimi, it seems like the cheapest option, not to mention cheesy.
5. The price is excessive for the quality

We won't ask for more"
ChIJIUwd8JUpQg0RLym5ZWEpgY8,1,The order through the just eat platform never arrived and they do not answer the phones. On the platform it said that it had been delivered and after 1 hour and a half nothing.
ChIJIUwd8JUpQg0RLym5ZWEpgY8,4,Slow service but exquisite sushi. I always order takeout!
ChIJIUwd8JUpQg0RLym5ZWEpgY8,1,"It took them an hour and a quarter to arrive. The bluefin tuna is not bluefin tuna, it is dyed, it is clearly seen that the dye stained the butterfish that was next to it (in the photo the two on the right are butterfish and therefore should be equally white, the middle piece was the one that was in contact with the supposed bluefin tuna that was dyed with what the tuna released). They are more expensive than other restaurants."
ChIJ7e72V5ApQg0RpsXMzCdNNhw,5,Loved that there are vegan pizza options ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChIJ7e72V5ApQg0RpsXMzCdNNhw,5,Ivan is very cool and the pizzas are very good !
ChIJ7e72V5ApQg0RpsXMzCdNNhw,5,"Great pizza, nice friendly staff. Also, ordered online on another occasion and all good - delicious pizza on time!"
ChIJ7e72V5ApQg0RpsXMzCdNNhw,5,"Amazing place for quality pizza, portion sizes are generous, great value for money, staff were very friendly, very clean 5/5."
ChIJ7e72V5ApQg0RpsXMzCdNNhw,4,Solid BBQ wings and BBQ pizza the small is enough for 1 hungry person.
ChIJ19zPspUpQg0R0PazbMsbm0w,5,Ok
ChIJ19zPspUpQg0R0PazbMsbm0w,3,Average
ChIJ19zPspUpQg0R0PazbMsbm0w,4,"Very good family and neighborhood place. They have a large air-conditioned space as a terrace/dining room. They make rice, in any of its specialties, spectacular. The rest of the portions are good in size (those in the photos are all half portions) and good. Recommended site. They also have gluten-free beer."
ChIJ19zPspUpQg0R0PazbMsbm0w,2,"Bad experience.

Online reservations do not work. Despite having confirmed the reservation, upon arrival, they tell me that they do not work for them. They gave me a table by chance, they were almost full.

I can't comment on the daily menu, but I can comment on what I ate.

The grilled prawns, very good. Good size and good workmanship.

Zumburi√±as with very good appearance. The sauce was not the classic oil and garlic sauce and it would be good, I think, if they had added some salt. They were completely bland.

The fried fish was composed of anchovies, chopitos, squid and very vinegary dogfish, nothing else and without a hint of salt.

The torrija, good.

And expensive, excessively expensive."
ChIJ19zPspUpQg0R0PazbMsbm0w,5,Everything is great!!!! We recommend the grilled octopus and rice with lobster ü¶û!!! Very good!!! And the post torrija!!!
ChIJI3AMTZQpQg0Rr8QYqlE77kk,4,"Nice ambient and nice place to go!!! Meals are good, very well presented in dish and taste very good. High quality ingredients are used. Highly recommended!!! Staff is very attentive and recommend meals of you have a doubt. Smiles are free and always present! Recommended place to go!"
ChIJI3AMTZQpQg0Rr8QYqlE77kk,5,Love it ü§≠
ChIJI3AMTZQpQg0Rr8QYqlE77kk,5,Ok
ChIJI3AMTZQpQg0Rr8QYqlE77kk,5,Nice
ChIJI3AMTZQpQg0Rr8QYqlE77kk,5,"The experience was fantastic. From the first moment, the staff were incredible, friendly and always attentive, which created a very relaxed and familiar atmosphere that made us feel at home. The food was delicious: the melted provolone was a real delight, the seafood pasta was full of flavor, and the pizza was simply perfect. Everything was delicious, with excellent quality and authentic flavors that left us delighted. Without a doubt, we will repeat. Highly recommended!"
ChIJu9JiIpgpQg0R3vwBLJMEUEY,5,"Chill bar, food was good and the people are nice!"
ChIJu9JiIpgpQg0R3vwBLJMEUEY,4,Ok
ChIJu9JiIpgpQg0R3vwBLJMEUEY,3,Nice
ChIJu9JiIpgpQg0R3vwBLJMEUEY,5,Way
ChIJu9JiIpgpQg0R3vwBLJMEUEY,5,"A fantastic place, we celebrated my eldest daughter's communion and it was a success. Fantastic service, with a lot of professionalism and kindness; Delicious and very abundant food. The treatment we received was wonderful, we booked the venue downstairs to continue the celebration in the afternoon with snacks and karaoke and a magician. Without a doubt we will repeat with our next daughter. Many thanks for everything!"
ChIJIQ3Ia5gpQg0RrM9LX3widhU,4,Very good. Owner didn't speak any English to me but I was able to get by with my limited spanish. Recommend the pickles and aubergine from the case to go with my gallinejas. Really great lamb fat taste to those intestines. Bread was pretty dry but otherwise great visit.
ChIJIQ3Ia5gpQg0RrM9LX3widhU,5,"From the heart of Madrid straight to your palate.
This house has been dedicated to selling gallinejas, entresijos and other dishes of this traditional Madrid cuisine for 65 years, such as gizzards, joints, buttons and chicharrones."
ChIJIQ3Ia5gpQg0RrM9LX3widhU,5,Very cozy little terrace. Tapas that surprise by the quantity. The chicken sandwich is very good. I will return
ChIJIQ3Ia5gpQg0RrM9LX3widhU,2,"A neighborhood bar, quite poorly organized with cases of drinks here and there, stacked tables and poor cleaning. I went expressly because they have a good reputation for their ins and outs and gallinejas, I ordered a chicken sandwich because they didn't have ins and outs, the truth is that they were very overcooked and tough, anyone who has tried them in another restaurant specializing in them will know this.
I give two stars because the waitress was correct and the beer was cold."
ChIJIQ3Ia5gpQg0RrM9LX3widhU,5,"The crunchy ins and outs sandwiches are incredible, they are the ones I like the most.  Now spring on the terrace is very good. In winter inside the premises there is NOT that fried smell that characterizes these establishments. I recommend it."
ChIJUYRCCLwpQg0RsxUBNZRM5PA,3,Original marroqui food prepared from the owner of the bar... classical spanish bar... with nothing remarkable
ChIJUYRCCLwpQg0RsxUBNZRM5PA,5,Simple and nice/ nice terrace and good service
ChIJUYRCCLwpQg0RsxUBNZRM5PA,5,OK
ChIJUYRCCLwpQg0RsxUBNZRM5PA,1,"Muy mala comida, los fritos saben a aceite reutilizado muchas veces. Da aprensi√≥n porque tiene pinta de sucio. Y si te encima el camarero se permite comentarios fuera de lugar con tu hija , mejor no volver."
ChIJUYRCCLwpQg0RsxUBNZRM5PA,1,"Having good looking appetizers, he preferred to give us a bowl of chips, I suppose because they were not common. Bad technique to get new clientele."
ChIJMWUy5bwpQg0RqGIljju4cYA,1,"The lousy food. Also, I think he is the only Asian who has not been able to provide a measly prawn bread with an order of ‚Ç¨20 NOT TO RETURN. I don't give fewer stars because it's not possible."
ChIJMWUy5bwpQg0RqGIljju4cYA,1,I order delivery and after 40 minutes the food is cancelled. sad

ChIJOSfZ7pUpQg0RRvYfalEMJ28,4,"Good ingredients, well served. Very helpful service"
ChIJOSfZ7pUpQg0RRvYfalEMJ28,2,"Sushi delivery took 80 minutes, while the Uber eats application promises delivery in 15/30 minutes!
Besides, the sushi brought was ""laughter in the room"", very tiny...
I also want to point out that the salmon is cut so thin that the entire portion will not even weigh 20 grams!
She paid 17 ‚Ç¨ for everything and I don't know what I paid for... I will never recommend it to anyone!"
ChIJOSfZ7pUpQg0RRvYfalEMJ28,1,"Order placed from Uber Eats that does not arrive, making it impossible to assess the quality of the food. After placing the order through the app, with a scheduled time from 8:00 p.m. to arrive at 10:00 p.m., we called the establishment by phone around 10:10 p.m. and they responded that it was on its way. Within an hour, the order has not arrived and they do not answer the phone again, repeatedly diverting the calls and without taking responsibility. We ran out of dinner, so we do not recommend anyone to rely on the service of this restaurant."
ChIJOSfZ7pUpQg0RRvYfalEMJ28,5,"Well, I don't understand the bad reviews, I just ordered a day of soccer 30 minutes ago and not only did it arrive ahead of time, but the sushi surprised me for the better. Maybe I've been lucky, who knows.

We will repeat."

ChIJwRiBYvcpQg0R4A0-aCMMzQc,4,"In general it is quite good, I have used the home delivery service and I have no complaints. But what disappoints me a lot is that I started ordering from this restaurant precisely because they had onigiris on the menu and that is not very common, being a dish that I miss in other restaurants, but for some time now they are never available on their menu... so for me, I fear that they lose their greatest appeal... I hope they will soon offer them on the menu at home!"
ChIJwRiBYvcpQg0R4A0-aCMMzQc,5,"I recently had the opportunity to try Origini Restaurant's sushi delivery service in my area and I was absolutely impressed.¬†The quality of the sushi was exceptional, with fresh ingredients and rich, authentic flavors.¬†Each piece was meticulously prepared, evidence of the chef's skill and attention to detail.

Delivery was fast and efficient, arriving sooner than expected.¬†The delivery person was friendly and professional, and the packaging kept the food fresh and in perfect condition during transport.

Additionally, the variety of options on the menu was impressive, offering a wide selection of sushi rolls, sashimi and other Japanese dishes.¬†It was a real delight to be able to enjoy this level of Japanese food without having to leave home.

Overall, my experience with [Origini]'s sushi delivery service was exceptional and I will definitely order again in the future."

ChIJOZGmoVwpQg0R-hBUK6zaYko,4,"The guy who served us was very friendly and pleasant, the cheese volcano, as they say, if you are a cheese lover, it is something you should order.
We have ordered the truffle omelette and a La pija burger, all very good and highly recommended. The only downside is that I asked for the burger rare and they served it to me just right. We enjoyed dinner, but this detail has made the experience not complete."
ChIJOZGmoVwpQg0R-hBUK6zaYko,5,"Good choice
We were 4 people and we were able to enjoy several dishes to share.
Nachos, cheese volcano, chicken tacos, carbonara tortilla, Iberian ribs...
Everything, everything very good. We were good but we had to try the desserts especially the brownies
Unbeatable attention
We were on the terrace"
ChIJOZGmoVwpQg0R-hBUK6zaYko,3,"We were on the terrace, the best thing about the place. It gives a lot of sun and is luxurious.
The food was quite good, perhaps the fried ones should raise the temperature of the oil and dry well, the breaded chicken was quite oily.
Caesar's tacos are pretty good too. The brave ones good. The burger at its point.
We will return to try more things. But above all we will return for the terrace."
ChIJOZGmoVwpQg0R-hBUK6zaYko,5,"It's a really cool place. You can have breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner. The menu is varied and the products are good!! I have been several times and I will return for sure!!! The waitress Alex is super nice and professional, she treated us super well!"
ChIJqWk7xzwpQg0RYzfAp3aC7jw,5,"New burger restaurant in the neighborhood and everything is delicious! We ordered crispy ear, salad and bravas with two very good and elaborate sauces, the Roquefort one was a surprise, very delicious! Yesterday we went back for dinner to try the burger and it was exquisite! It shows that it is high quality meat. On the terrace it is wonderful and entertaining on match days as it is in front of the football field. The waiters were charming and made sure that we didn't miss anything, you can tell they are professionals. Thank you very much for everything, we will return for sureüòä"
ChIJqWk7xzwpQg0RYzfAp3aC7jw,5,"Rodrigo is the best host, but the classic burger is AMAZING!! 100% recommended"
ChIJqWk7xzwpQg0RYzfAp3aC7jw,5,"Very familiar place with a lot of atmosphere and food of very good quality and flavor. The staff very friendly and close. On Sundays they make rice!!!
Great burgers and sandwiches!"
ChIJqWk7xzwpQg0RYzfAp3aC7jw,5,"A wonderful place, high quality meat and delicious burgers! Highly recommended."
ChIJqWk7xzwpQg0RYzfAp3aC7jw,5,"Unbeatable experience, spectacular treatment and service, the classic smash burger is delicious and very well priced. The incredible flavor, I will definitely return to try the others.
I saw that it opened recently and I always wanted to go in and it was a very right decision"
ChIJFwChP0spQg0RAXdyu6Iu0Lk,5,"We have ordered two rice dishes for 16 people: chicken and cheeks. Both very good, really. We went for them at 1:00 p.m. and didn't start eating until 3:00 p.m. The fear we had was that it would go away, but the other way around. It was still just as good.
We also tried the Russian salad and it was very good.
Wonderful attention, without a doubt, we will order again."
ChIJFwChP0spQg0RAXdyu6Iu0Lk,5,"Since we moved to the neighborhood they told us about this place. After seeing the opinions, we decided to try it, convinced of the good choice. Our first order was the rice with cuttlefish and shrimp, and the low-temperature torrezno, each more spectacular. As if that were not enough, the managers are overflowing with sympathy and kindness. Clearly we will try the entire menu and then we will start again."
ChIJFwChP0spQg0RAXdyu6Iu0Lk,5,"I have ordered different rice dishes, Russian salad, potatoes with mojo on several occasions and we love everything.

Furthermore, the attention is wonderful."
ChIJFwChP0spQg0RAXdyu6Iu0Lk,5,"We have ordered rice to take away a couple of times and we loved it, the prepared dishes are not bad either, they come with instructions so that they are just right! The staff is friendly and they meet the deadlines, we will definitely repeat!"
ChIJFwChP0spQg0RAXdyu6Iu0Lk,5,"Excellent rice, this is the third time I have ordered a paella (2 senyoret and 1 black) and it does not disappoint. Family place, where you can see the love with which they make it. Nice people and reasonable price."
ChIJ32aukkEpQg0RlZIOeHqIKuQ,5,Super friendly people and the most delicious homemade pizza!!!üòã
ChIJ32aukkEpQg0RlZIOeHqIKuQ,5,"Very good pizzas, not only because of the ingredients, but also because of the dough they make it with.
The customer service is very close and pleasant.
Advisable."
ChIJ32aukkEpQg0RlZIOeHqIKuQ,5,"Delicious pizzas, garlic bread and delicious ham rolls.
I always went for Hawaiian pizza because it's my favorite. Marriage is lovely.
Happy holidays üéÑ you are great ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJ32aukkEpQg0RlZIOeHqIKuQ,4,"We called to order for recommendations of flavor, quality and speed. Everything more than fulfilled. It only took 15 minutes to place the order, two medium pizzas. As soon as I arrived to pick them up, they were freshly picked out to take home. Furthermore, the person who answers the phone and charges is nice, attentive and pleasant. The quality of the pizzas is very good, we ordered the slaughter one, for us the best of the two, and the autumn fantasy, which although good, left me a little more simply. We will definitely return, but as a point of improvement I would say that the RRSS are more updated to, for example, know the pizza of the month.
Don't hesitate to go/order!"
ChIJ32aukkEpQg0RlZIOeHqIKuQ,1,"My cold pizza and dry garlic breads arrived. In addition, the pizza box had a broken seal and the pizza was completely rolled into a ""ball"" inside a completely ""battered"" box, dirty and full of oil.

I would like to know if the restaurant delivers the pizzas and boxes in this state, or if it was the result of the Glovo delivery girl named Viviana Mar√≠a (I indicate it here to warn you), who arrived more than 20 minutes late. I can handle the fact that the pizza arrives late even though I live practically next door, but the state of the food is something else and the unsealed box annoys me, since it is food and I don't know if it could have been 'manipulated' by the delivery girl.

In short, a bad experience, both because of the state of the food and because of the distribution by Glovo."
ChIJE9S77pUpQg0RX6eIlVuSXk0,4,Dinner prepared well and tasty
ChIJE9S77pUpQg0RX6eIlVuSXk0,2,Puffff
ChIJE9S77pUpQg0RX6eIlVuSXk0,5,"Spectacular!!!!
Both in the treatment, they have been super attentive and the kindness with which they have treated us!!!
The food is of high quality and everything is delicious!! I recommend!!!!!
We will return!!!"
ChIJE9S77pUpQg0RX6eIlVuSXk0,5,"Without a doubt I recommend the paella, it is a very typical dish and they achieve a very special flavor. It is a very nice place and the cleanliness is very noticeable, the service is quite good and the food tastes very good. I will definitely return"
ChIJE9S77pUpQg0RX6eIlVuSXk0,5,"The first time I come and I will repeat, apart from how delicious the cachopo and the prawns have been, the treatment by the owner and staff is excellent and very attentive so that we are satisfied.
Highly recommended even though I live half an hour away by car üòú"
ChIJYzflqQopQg0RDrIN0sLqJXw,5,One of the best Persian meals that I've had in Spain by far. The koobideh was so tender and the rice was just the right balance (not too buttery but not too dry). Can't wait until the next visit.
ChIJYzflqQopQg0RDrIN0sLqJXw,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this Iranian restaurant, and I must say the experience was truly outstanding. The food is incredibly delicious, bursting with authentic flavors that showcase the rich culinary heritage of Iran. Every dish is carefully prepared, offering a perfect balance of spices and freshness.

The ambiance of the restaurant is warm and inviting, reflecting a deep respect for Islamic traditions. The staff are exceptionally friendly and attentive, making every visit feel welcoming and personal. Their genuine hospitality truly enhances the dining experience.

Overall, this restaurant not only provides a feast for the taste buds but also offers a delightful atmosphere where culture and cuisine blend seamlessly. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable meal with top-notch service.:)"
ChIJYzflqQopQg0RDrIN0sLqJXw,5,"I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant in Madrid! The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure everything was perfect. The atmosphere was delightful, and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for better service. I wholeheartedly recommend visiting; I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll fall in love with it just like I did!"
ChIJYzflqQopQg0RDrIN0sLqJXw,5,"We absolutely loved the whole experience! Beautiful food, wonderful atmosphere and service. We will be back!"
ChIJYzflqQopQg0RDrIN0sLqJXw,5,Very delicious food and friendly staff! Don‚Äôt forget to try their Kofte!
ChIJmSDYQwEpQg0R0aoSMFPMCmE,5,"Economical, first class service. Recommended."
ChIJmSDYQwEpQg0R0aoSMFPMCmE,4,Neighborhood bar to have some beers. Serves food at home.
ChIJ6SJG9DwpQg0R_n9ZWJE0E0Y,1,It's called Rincon de Maya and it's not open on Sundays at noon...
ChIJ6SJG9DwpQg0R_n9ZWJE0E0Y,5,"I love it, I've been going for years and the treatment is very good, plus you can be with your dogs outside in the restaurant area that is covered"
ChIJ6SJG9DwpQg0R_n9ZWJE0E0Y,5,"I love this place, the food is very delicious and the mojitos and capiri√±as even better. The owners are very nice"

The owners are sweethearts.
Good tapas.
The vermouth they prepare for you is super delicious.
Whenever we can, we get closer."
ChIJO5KBVgApQg0R3W2Fn6843DQ,5,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
I was with some friends and an incredible experience from start to finish! I tried a waffle with strawberry and banana topping with dulce de leche, and every bite was a delight. The combination of flavors and the crispy outside and soft inside texture made it perfect. I also enjoyed the Romeo and Juliet cake with guava cream, a unique explosion of flavor that I recommend without hesitation.

In addition, the crepes are spectacular, with a perfect dough and generous fillings that conquer the palate. And the coffee‚Ä¶ the best I have ever had in my life! To complete, exceptional dedication and attention.

I loved the experience and will definitely be back for more!"
ChIJO5KBVgApQg0R3W2Fn6843DQ,5,"Everything delicious!!

We ordered a Guava smoothie that was spectacular. The salty chicken crepe has a very good flavor, with the crepe dough it makes a great combination.

As for the waffle, it was delicious. With a lot of flavor but without being too cloying.

The boy who served us was charming. He made us recommendations for next time.

We will definitely repeat!!!"
ChIJO5KBVgApQg0R3W2Fn6843DQ,5,"Everything delicious!! The dishes are very generous and very very good! We had Nutella and strawberry waffle and several crepes. We were also surprised by the truffle crepe which was delicious! Furthermore, the place is very cozy. We will return without a doubt!"
ChIJO5KBVgApQg0R3W2Fn6843DQ,5,"A very nice and delicious place to have a snack and dinner!!! The shale chicken crepe and the waffle are very good, the dough and the rich ingredients. Very good attention. 100x100 recommended."
ChIJO5KBVgApQg0R3W2Fn6843DQ,5,La atenci√≥n y la comida de 10. El lugar s√∫per acogedor buena m√∫sica y s√∫per delicioso todo. Qued√© s√∫per llena que tuve que llevarme la mitad pero no creo que llegue a ma√±ana üòãü´¢. Me llevo una tarta as√≠ que ya les contar√©....
ChIJ9zv1SZYpQg0RefBevEP9Dfw,5,Generous portions.  Friendly host.  I highly recommend.
ChIJ9zv1SZYpQg0RefBevEP9Dfw,5,The greatest chicken of Madrid!!
ChIJ9zv1SZYpQg0RefBevEP9Dfw,4,Good cheaper place
ChIJ9zv1SZYpQg0RefBevEP9Dfw,5,"I love Bar Torres. Delicious Mahou beer with good tapas. Good quality chicken wings, very delicious ear. Good prices. Totally recommended."
ChIJ9zv1SZYpQg0RefBevEP9Dfw,1,"The owner spoke to me very rudely. I was playing with some balls that collide and make a little noise and in a bad manner he tells me to stop, I stop and he continues to tell me off. And also he called me young and thought I was a boy and I am a girl. It was also night and the entire bar was almost dark and you couldn't see anything. I give it one star because I can't give less."
ChIJ08h6v6IpQg0RUrb7FN1fOLY,4,Rico ummmm
ChIJ08h6v6IpQg0RUrb7FN1fOLY,5,"We have ordered from this Chinese restaurant many times since it is very close to us.
Normally we go in, order and within 10 minutes we come out with the food. It's very fast.
For me, it is the best rice of all the Chinese I have tried (both 3delicias and with egg).
They fill the tupperware to the top.
Good prices: spring rolls (‚Ç¨1.30/unit), rice with egg ‚Ç¨3.55 and lemon chicken ‚Ç¨4.75.
There are always delivery people picking up food.
It has 3 tables on the terrace üëç"
ChIJ08h6v6IpQg0RUrb7FN1fOLY,5,All the food is very delicious at a good price and with quality. They gave us some chicken wings. We will repeat :)
ChIJ08h6v6IpQg0RUrb7FN1fOLY,1,"I ordered through just eat because of the reviews. They are surely false. I called because you see the burnt rolls? The lady told me that she had seen them and that they were like that and that I didn't understand. If you want very expensive dwarf shrimp rolls that are burnt to the point of causing cancer, this is your place. The very bad spicy-sour soup, they forgot the rice...a disaster...and salty, it seems that they abuse glutamate. I won't buy here again. bad food"
ChIJ08h6v6IpQg0RUrb7FN1fOLY,5,"Very friendly, everything delicious, good price and quantity. A very good detail also that we needed to eat out for my dog ‚Äã‚Äãand they immediately found a table for us, we will return and we will also order at home"
ChIJZeHP6pcpQg0RUEc6ariFJrs,1,"After half an hour waiting, they come out and say that they have 11 chickens and that they won't make any more. This at 2 in the afternoon. You can't reserve chickens in advance, you can't pay with a card, dry treatment, very average quality chickens on the low side, they seem frozen (from other times I've bought it). A gem of a place let's go!"
ChIJZeHP6pcpQg0RUEc6ariFJrs,1,"The man is poorly educated, he doesn't know how to count his clients, the treatment is disastrous, you can only pay by card, enormous waiting time. I do not recommend the site at all"
ChIJZeHP6pcpQg0RUEc6ariFJrs,5,"I like to buy roast chicken here, they have been around for many years and it shows because they come out very good, one of the best I have ever tried, they also have more takeaway food and some homemade desserts. The owners are very nice."
ChIJZeHP6pcpQg0RUEc6ariFJrs,2,"The man who serves has always been friendly, it is true that the chicken usually does not have much flavor. But, in this last purchase the chicken came out dry, as if it had been reheated and without flavor, it began to feel bad to us as we finished eating. It has already generated distrust in me looking at the latest reviews."
ChIJZeHP6pcpQg0RUEc6ariFJrs,5,"I've been buying their roast chicken for years, among other things."
ChIJHbdP-5spQg0RS1Wk2uTUqlo,5,"loved it all, from the argentinian chickpea bread to the pizza and the chocolate cake... we even got tapas chips. the service, esp, 10 stars!"
ChIJHbdP-5spQg0RS1Wk2uTUqlo,5,"10/10. We had a problem with our Uber eats delivery guy and since Uber didn‚Äôt respond we called the restaurant. Even though it was not their fault, nor did they have to help us, they did everything and more. The pizza was delicious like always and the chocolate cake made our weeküíô thank you again"
ChIJHbdP-5spQg0RS1Wk2uTUqlo,5,"Amazing place to enjoy a nice meal. The empanadas and the pizzas are excellent.
I will definitely recommend it!!"
ChIJHbdP-5spQg0RS1Wk2uTUqlo,5,Amazing!
ChIJHbdP-5spQg0RS1Wk2uTUqlo,5,"Excellent pizzas, very delicious and the best Argentine empanadas I have tried in Madrid, especially the Argentine meat one. You can tell that they are homemade since the flavor is incredible. The chocolate cake and the white chocolate alfajor are wonderful. The attention of the managers is unbeatable. The place is very nice and cozy, and it is also well located.  Without a doubt we will return and we recommend it 100%."
ChIJMbtWWZ8pQg0RqCg1EUynWuQ,4,Great place with tasty food at very reasonable price. The waiters are very nice and the outside tables are cozy and close to the park
ChIJMbtWWZ8pQg0RqCg1EUynWuQ,3,"A bit slow, but ok menu for 9,5‚Ç¨."
ChIJMbtWWZ8pQg0RqCg1EUynWuQ,5,"We went for an aperitif on a Sunday morning.
Good terrace next to the park.
They gave us 2 very juicy Moorish skewers with the drink, although we also saw that they served tortilla with torreznos or paella as a tapa.
Affordable prices.
Good service.
We saw that they had a lunch menu."
ChIJMbtWWZ8pQg0RqCg1EUynWuQ,5,A traditional bar with very good portions and very good service. Homemade food and good lunch menu. Sometimes there are a lot of young people and it is a little noisy but they always serve you with a smile. We will repeat
ChIJMbtWWZ8pQg0RqCg1EUynWuQ,5,I have never eaten better in my life. Super nice and efficient staff. The terrace overlooking the park. The cook is fantastic. Alejandra the brilliant and super polite waitress. Wonderful Roc√≠o and Freddy. Places like this make Spain great
ChIJK4ZczgopQg0R-rXx7M9GQMM,5,Good food
ChIJK4ZczgopQg0R-rXx7M9GQMM,5,"Very fast collection of the food üçî
The attention was great too"
ChIJK4ZczgopQg0R-rXx7M9GQMM,5,"Nice service and tasty food, loved it."
ChIJK4ZczgopQg0R-rXx7M9GQMM,5,"Nice staff, clean and fast."
ChIJK4ZczgopQg0R-rXx7M9GQMM,5,This is our go to place.
ChIJ11YOSZ4pQg0RIJhBi2a9HdI,1,"The meat was very little and tough, it taste dry so for mi is hardly eat it a second time."
ChIJ11YOSZ4pQg0RIJhBi2a9HdI,5,Only kebab/shawarma place (that I know of) in Barrio del Pilar that has hummus. Servings are also very generous.
ChIJ11YOSZ4pQg0RIJhBi2a9HdI,2,"I only buy kebab here, the price is affordable, the size is huge, but the meat is tasteless."
ChIJ11YOSZ4pQg0RIJhBi2a9HdI,5,Ricicimo
ChIJ11YOSZ4pQg0RIJhBi2a9HdI,4,Comida correcta y barata. Platos de pl√°stico y todo muy b√°sico. El se√±or no es muy hablador pero sirve r√°pido. No hay servicio en mesa que adem√°s solo tiene 4 o 5 mesitas. Local muy peque√±ito. Los ba√±os est√°n en un s√≥tano con dif√≠cil acceso por unas escalerillas.muy estrechas.
ChIJOYsMhQspQg0RCzWqV1wWocQ,5,Lots of choices for breakfast. Free small fresh orange juice. I ordered tomato and oil  toast. For me too much garlic. They have a menu for lunch which seems to be delicious. Very comfortable and wide saloon.
ChIJOYsMhQspQg0RCzWqV1wWocQ,1,"Waiter a bit old ( surely owner ) rude and want to choose instead of you what you can get in your breakfast. Quantity and quality disastrous, cheapest queso and jam√≥n possible and EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE for a poor quality in a Dirty place who doesn't even provide receipt, they just want your money. At the price of one breakfast here, you can get 2 full breakfast anywhere else. Everybody smoke  on the terrace, nobody cares about the Covid restrictions TO AVOID"
ChIJOYsMhQspQg0RCzWqV1wWocQ,5,Great place with delicious food and unforgettable bear
ChIJOYsMhQspQg0RCzWqV1wWocQ,5,Nice I like it because they give a good service..
ChIJOYsMhQspQg0RCzWqV1wWocQ,3,GOOD.GREAT PLACE ON SUNDAYS WITH THE RASTRO.(URBAN MARKET)
ChIJjd-FzQkpQg0RO45tCAkrJyM,5,Good food and atmosphere - friendly staff - we will come again - thank you for good treatment
ChIJjd-FzQkpQg0RO45tCAkrJyM,5,"Amor Plato has phenomenal food. Burgers are on pointt. The teqenos are absolutely amazing, a regular purchase of mine and the vermouth fresh and tasty. You won't find better service in the area, with the owner David, being the best."
ChIJjd-FzQkpQg0RO45tCAkrJyM,3,We had Provoleta which was great and Entrec√¥te had a certain taste. Ok wine. Not sure if we come back.
ChIJjd-FzQkpQg0RO45tCAkrJyM,5,excellent spanish food. real homie and hearty food. great staff and good prices.
ChIJjd-FzQkpQg0RO45tCAkrJyM,5,best bar in all of Madrid! most friendly staff and awesome cuisine!
ChIJCTOSnJkpQg0RryZ47L8b4cc,1,"I can‚Äôt give below 1 star.. food is bad, staff are worst . I never visit this store ever.. please share you know customer care"
ChIJCTOSnJkpQg0RryZ47L8b4cc,5,"It‚Äôs not too salty and it tastes good,with a lot of pepperoni. This is the first full pizza I‚Äôve had since coming to Europe:)"
ChIJCTOSnJkpQg0RryZ47L8b4cc,1,"Worst service I have ever experienced. I tried to communicate to the manager the problem we had with the Carbonara pizza and she was so rude and disrespectful that instead of apologizing to the customer she replied that  there was no problem with the pizza and that is was only our opinions about the flavor. She even suggested that Carbonara pizza was the most sold pizza of the restaurant. She did not take our opinion into consideration or offer us another pizza in exchange. Finally, the restaurant is not clean."
ChIJCTOSnJkpQg0RryZ47L8b4cc,1,"If I can give 0 star, I'd definitely like to do it!!!!
Today, I went to the shop and ordered 'Texas BBQ crispy' to go. When I was arrived at home and opened the pizza box, I saw a VERY weird-looking pizza. It looked totally different as I previously ordered!!!!
They gave me the pizza with weird dough and unevenly distributed toppings!!!
I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED about Domino pizza and I will never go to Domino pizza anymore."
ChIJCTOSnJkpQg0RryZ47L8b4cc,4,Good american pizza and has a helpful english speaking staff
ChIJBSp8epkpQg0RmU4DMAep7DM,5,Easily one of the best pizzas you will have in Madrid and the staff are always super friendly!
ChIJBSp8epkpQg0RmU4DMAep7DM,5,Ok
ChIJBSp8epkpQg0RmU4DMAep7DM,5,Good
ChIJBSp8epkpQg0RmU4DMAep7DM,5,Awesome pizza
ChIJBSp8epkpQg0RmU4DMAep7DM,1,"It's a shame not to be able to try these pizzas since Just Eat has destroyed them. They have thrown all the work of the pizzeria in the trash since they have transported them in a place that they do not fit, so they have folded the box and also vertically so the pizzas have arrived flattened on one side with all the ingredients mixed and outside the pizza, they were quite disgusting, it seemed like they were taken from the trash.
Just Eat has not given us any solution, I cannot risk ordering again, having it brought to me again like this and being left without dinner again since Just Eat only distributes it.
It's a shame for the pizzeria, its work, its effort and its time wasted."
ChIJz_BCuqYpQg0ROSpIL1tcQ0U,5,My bueno
ChIJz_BCuqYpQg0ROSpIL1tcQ0U,4,Yummy foods
ChIJz_BCuqYpQg0ROSpIL1tcQ0U,5,"The Astro dog certainly has a flavor from another galaxy!!!
Nepson served us, a 10!!!"
ChIJz_BCuqYpQg0ROSpIL1tcQ0U,3,"A perfect place to have a snack before going through the park, chips, soft drinks and hot coffee ideal to take to the park on these cool days."
ChIJz_BCuqYpQg0ROSpIL1tcQ0U,5,"The quiet atmosphere is very pleasant, the food is very good and the price is good... it is a highly advisable visit and the staff helps you if you are lost in the menu üòãüòã"
ChIJYyaG2V4pQg0RgcmMtnGYf5s,5,Top
ChIJYyaG2V4pQg0RgcmMtnGYf5s,5,"Very good burgers at home. They arrived at a good temperature and the potatoes were quite decent for home delivery.
The pizza dough is very original to wrap the burger so that it arrives at the perfect point.
We ordered one with special sauce which was spectacular. The point of the meat Just as we ordered it"
ChIJYyaG2V4pQg0RgcmMtnGYf5s,1,"Since they work with Uber Eats it is unfortunate. I have 3 out of 3 that arrive late. The other day more than an hour waiting for the order and as a consequence they arrive cold and humid. Before that didn't happen, it was a rare week that I didn't ask for it. The previous fast food platform was much more punctual"
ChIJYyaG2V4pQg0RgcmMtnGYf5s,5,"We placed an order and the truth is that it is very good, it is another way to eat a hamburger. In addition to the fact that they have an especially good one with pesto, as well as the pistachio cheesecake and the carrot cake, the flavor is completely achieved and the presentation is very beautiful."
ChIJYyaG2V4pQg0RgcmMtnGYf5s,1,"We ordered original and cheese burgers with regular potatoes and wedges. Everything was very good, tasty, meat of very good quality and at the right point, crispy and tasty potatoes, very good presentation. The order arrived at the indicated time.

The reason for the low score is that it is not indicated until the last step that home delivery is outsourced to Uber. This information should appear clearly on the website or, at least, in the first step of processing the order. The user must know from the first moment that they are going to hire the services not only of Nugu but also of another secondary company."
ChIJmT9O-s4pQg0RydbCvfk0Hk4,5,"One of my friends and I favourite and most recommended places on town. We first came here by recommendation too and it has become our most visited bar for this last 3 years. Cheap prices, loads of food and drinks and nice customer service makes this family business a place to visit and have a drink or a meal"
ChIJmT9O-s4pQg0RydbCvfk0Hk4,5,"Great food, amazing service, welcoming owners - absolutely recommend you check it out!"
ChIJmT9O-s4pQg0RydbCvfk0Hk4,5,"Great little neighborhood bar with outdoor terrace, hardworking staff and fast service. Particularly recommend the pigs ear!!"
ChIJmT9O-s4pQg0RydbCvfk0Hk4,5,Nice place
ChIJmT9O-s4pQg0RydbCvfk0Hk4,5,All very delicious and at a good price!! Efficient and good tapas. The juicy potato omelette! Good terrace
ChIJT9XmYKIpQg0R-T-4BEHfrMQ,4,"Authentic, small local cafeteria. Loved it. We had tortilla and 1/2 raci√≥n of patatas and chorizo and padr√≥n peppers"
ChIJT9XmYKIpQg0R-T-4BEHfrMQ,5,"I stopped here by chance, and they gave me unbeatable treatment, at a good price and with good quality of food. Recommended site"
ChIJT9XmYKIpQg0R-T-4BEHfrMQ,5,"Great atmosphere on a Saturday at noon. The reason? Cold beer, reasonable price, abundant tapas (very abundant), and friendly, close and effective service. All the terraces next door were empty and the one in this bar was full; let them look at it. We spent more than 6 hours there because we were so uncomfortable. Beer, portions, drinks, coffees and the bill did not reach ‚Ç¨130 between 5 people."
ChIJT9XmYKIpQg0R-T-4BEHfrMQ,5,"We went for a beer and had three. Attention, price and atmosphere of 10."
ChIJT9XmYKIpQg0R-T-4BEHfrMQ,5,"Very cold beer and they always put a good tapa. Place to repeat. Attentive waiter and the best in the area for a tapa.
Every day I plan to return to the tapa several times.
A real discovery with a terrace included"
ChIJU8LX9V4pQg0REKl8REZITFo,4,Really happy experience! We ordered by Glovo. Food arrved in time and it was very good. We appreciated everything we ordered. Gyoza de langostinos Fritos were super! Perfect quality/price ratio. Definitely my preferred sushi restaurant in Madrid
ChIJU8LX9V4pQg0REKl8REZITFo,5,"Excellent and delicious food üç£, all the ingredients are fresh, very tasty and the price/quality ratio is really good!! Definitely recommend!"
ChIJU8LX9V4pQg0REKl8REZITFo,5,"Their sushi is really good!! The quality - price ratio is unbelievably worth it and they are always super nice, welcoming and smiley. Every time I order sushi now is from this place and I‚Äôm so happy with it :)"
ChIJU8LX9V4pQg0REKl8REZITFo,2,Very expenive Vs qualite
ChIJU8LX9V4pQg0REKl8REZITFo,5,"It is my reference restaurant to order Sushi in the Barrio del Pilar. They have affordable prices, good products and also the service is punctual and super correct. It is very worth it."
ChIJsSJvagQpQg0RCs_sbXVHf98,1,"I asked for food, they never brought it to me, I called them and a very rude woman attended to me and told me that if they hadn't delivered it to me it wasn't her problem, and after yelling at me in very rude Spanish she hung up the phone on me leaving me with the word in my mouth, also after my family was left without food they stole my money because they never gave it back to me either, and when I tried to call again it seems that they picked up the phone because it seemed like it was out of service They are thieves, I do not recommend this restaurant, be careful with them, they steal, I never recommend it, because of borders and thieves"
ChIJsSJvagQpQg0RCs_sbXVHf98,2,"The waitress who is the owner is very unpleasant and rude. I let him clean the table please and he threw the cloth at the table and told me, you clean it.
The restaurant is always empty."
ChIJsSJvagQpQg0RCs_sbXVHf98,5,"Everything is very rich. Fast and cooked to order. Kitchen in sight. By taste, the best Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood."
ChIJsSJvagQpQg0RCs_sbXVHf98,3,"The balloon canceled me saying that it was not in the location having given him the exact address, name of the bar and everything we were left without dinner and it is a small bar and I never arrived I don't know who is to blame but it's too bad it's a shame because the food is good"
ChIJsSJvagQpQg0RCs_sbXVHf98,5,"The kitchen is visible, it is a small restaurant, but clean and pleasant. It has a very varied menu, the quantities are generous and the prices reasonable."
ChIJ8ZDnYxwpQg0RZExvfTn-xvY,5,"First of all, I would like to highlight the kindness of Elquin, the effectiveness, friendliness and treatment of the waitress Lucia, she is charming, the place is very quiet and the pizzas are exquisite, I recommend it"

ChIJ9wU9SD4pQg0R4HM6hTeKN9E,5,Good
ChIJ9wU9SD4pQg0R4HM6hTeKN9E,4,"Buen local en la zona del Barrio del Pilar donde puedes disfrutar de comida mexicana de calidad. El trato del personal es exquisito. Las patatas boom estaban buen√≠simas, las quesadillas al pastor tambi√©n y el burrito que pedimos, incre√≠ble. Local muy recomendable."
ChIJ9wU9SD4pQg0R4HM6hTeKN9E,5,"Although it is hidden and this means that it does not attract as much attention as it should, the food is super delicious, the tacos come loaded and very very good, as well as the quesadilla and the burgers are super good. The service is fast and super friendly! The truth is that I recommend going to try their food because it is a sure success and you will repeat as much as we do."
ChIJ9wU9SD4pQg0R4HM6hTeKN9E,5,The carnitas burrito is very good and the portion is generous in relation to the price. The girl who helped me was very friendly and her service was spectacular.
ChIJ9wU9SD4pQg0R4HM6hTeKN9E,5,"Today we ate at the burritos place because they recommended it to us since sometimes we order take away because we love the smashes from this place!! My goodness, no known hamburger chain compares to it. The burritos are super loaded and delicious, tremendously delicious!!
I discovered the place a few months ago when I moved to the neighborhood and it is the best there is ü´∂üèº both for its food and for the people who serve it. Super loving people ü•∞
They serve super well and super fast, even WhatsApp responds quickly.
We will continue going because their prices are reasonable and because of the extra quality they offer üôåüèº"
ChIJ37OO_40pQg0Ra1VfWOAEfzU,5,"We really liked the portions of the food served to us. Plus, the fried eggplant was really amazing. Chicken wings were a whole meal onto themselves and extremely well made. Definitely visiting here again!"
ChIJ37OO_40pQg0Ra1VfWOAEfzU,5,"We have come to try their menu and we have been delighted, the food is delicious, plus the quantity-price ratio is phenomenal.
The attention has been great, recommending us what we might like. We will repeat for sure"
ChIJ37OO_40pQg0Ra1VfWOAEfzU,5,The best bar in the entire neighborhood. The unbeatable tomato
ChIJ37OO_40pQg0Ra1VfWOAEfzU,5,"Pleasant and comfortable, I highly recommend it, I loved it from the food, the drinks to the service, excellent place‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJ37OO_40pQg0Ra1VfWOAEfzU,5,"Very good service, very correct treatment with a good menu. You can taste Cuban food with very good quality. A place to have a coffee and some beers. The appetizers are very good, it is located near a school. I recommend it, I will definitely return."
ChIJbZ5FQCYpQg0RHMHx-MqIiWg,5,"Lovely space, with delicious food and great presentation of the dishes. The students do a wonderful job, they are polite and on a high professional level. The sea bass was one of the best fish dishes i have ever tasted and the desert delicious !
Gracias!"
ChIJbZ5FQCYpQg0RHMHx-MqIiWg,5,"Fantastic. Amazing food, the best service experience and the warmest welcome and atmosphere.
Thank you everyone, staff and learners, keep up the great job."
ChIJbZ5FQCYpQg0RHMHx-MqIiWg,5,The place was fantastic. The menue was very delicious and the service was excellent. We really enjoyed our lunch there.
ChIJbZ5FQCYpQg0RHMHx-MqIiWg,5,The food was excellent and students are well trained in cooking and serving. The were very kind and polite. Well done!
ChIJbZ5FQCYpQg0RHMHx-MqIiWg,5,Delicious food and excellent service!
ChIJGfVylgUpQg0RyW8G-beY71A,5,"Without a doubt, a place to repeat.
It's a small place, but with excellent staff and spectacular food. We ordered the cheesebacon potatoes, along with the teque√±os, for starters and both items were delicious. In addition, the potatoes came in a clay dish up to the top.
The burgers are all smash and we opted for the bacon cheese and the Iberian: they are incredible, very very delicious.
We will return for sure!"
ChIJGfVylgUpQg0RyW8G-beY71A,5,"Very good smashed burgers. The place is small, with only a couple of tables but you can take them home and they are very well maintained.
The brioche bread is very good, the meat is very juicy with the onion and cheese. Django's sauce is very good
Furthermore, the potatoes are homemade and it shows.
A 10 for the food and service"
ChIJGfVylgUpQg0RyW8G-beY71A,5,Very good value for money for the burgers. It has nothing to envy any hamburger chain. It's a small place but it also has delivery.
ChIJGfVylgUpQg0RyW8G-beY71A,5,"A delightful experience, we have been there 3 times and the food is very good, the burgers are brutal. And the girl's service is excellent and she always has home delivery orders, normal with how good everything is!"
ChIJGfVylgUpQg0RyW8G-beY71A,5,"Great discovery. The attention of the boys at all times has been exceptional, very attentive and pleasant. The place is very small, just 4 tables, but we have had dinner there, comfortable next to the iron, yes, you will leave with the smell on your clothes (but it has not been a problem). The baconcheese burger in Smash mode was delicious, the meat was loose and flavourful, the croquettes were spectacular, the best of the dinner, very creamy, lastly the baconcheese potatoes with the seasoning that they add are very good, you can tell that they are homemade. The bread goes perfectly with the burger. Highly recommended and perhaps more to order at home."
ChIJZXRRcpgpQg0RhwXCJp-zVQQ,1,Kebab with little pieces of bones.
ChIJZXRRcpgpQg0RhwXCJp-zVQQ,1,"The worst Durum I have ever eaten in my life. They do it without desire, they don't even close it and the white sauce, which is the most delicious, is mayonnaise!"
ChIJZXRRcpgpQg0RhwXCJp-zVQQ,5,"The best kebab I have ever eaten in my life and on top of that I love how they make it, they close it so you don't get stuck, I haven't seen anything like it."
ChIJZXRRcpgpQg0RhwXCJp-zVQQ,3,"The place is small, there are no tables, it is more for picking up and eating at home."
ChIJZXRRcpgpQg0RhwXCJp-zVQQ,1,"I have gone by 3 times to see if it is open and it was closed, the hours on Google are very incorrect and on top of that there is no sign on the door"
ChIJR6damJApQg0RAiA4dvs3GVc,1,"Ordered on Glovo in Madrid Center, after a delay of 1 hour, the order was cancelled. 0 stars"
ChIJR6damJApQg0RAiA4dvs3GVc,2,"I placed an order for home delivery through Glovo and the truth is that the burger was quite poor, it arrived scattered and the potatoes were frozen (which is normal) but of poor quality"
ChIJR6damJApQg0RAiA4dvs3GVc,4,
ChIJY4xx_w8pQg0R-RMDGU1X5bs,2,"Taste and price good, but irresponsible 12:45 closed when in theory on Sundays they open at 12:30 I knocked because I heard noise inside and nothing"
ChIJY4xx_w8pQg0R-RMDGU1X5bs,5,"I love the place, it would be nice if you could eat there but the price is good and the food is very delicious"
ChIJY4xx_w8pQg0R-RMDGU1X5bs,5,"The Bubble tea is very good, I totally recommend the large one, very good quality and price"
ChIJY4xx_w8pQg0R-RMDGU1X5bs,5,"Great, I recommend it, the only thing you have to do is put more wrap things in it but it's great"
ChIJY4xx_w8pQg0R-RMDGU1X5bs,3,
ChIJVw6QDgopQg0R4ZB2Yv4dGA4,5,Excellent food!
ChIJVw6QDgopQg0R4ZB2Yv4dGA4,4,"It is a small place but it is very good for both breakfast and lunch.
I recommend it"
ChIJVw6QDgopQg0R4ZB2Yv4dGA4,5,"Great place to eat and stay.... Quality and homemade food... very friendly waiter and the best thing is the menu. Baratiiiiiiiimoy very, very delicious ooooooo,
Don't stop going!!!!"
ChIJVw6QDgopQg0R4ZB2Yv4dGA4,3,"A quiet place, cheap prices... They don't charge by card.
If I have to add something negative I will say that it is Friday and it is 9:20 p.m. and they told me that they don't have anything to eat because the kitchen is off."
ChIJVw6QDgopQg0R4ZB2Yv4dGA4,5,It is a neighborhood bar with a very well-priced menu at ‚Ç¨11 even on Saturdays and they serve good food. I would repeat.
ChIJ8UGta5gpQg0RG2AoG96zjW4,5,"Might not look like much but don't be fooled! Fantastic pizza, really good price and very friendly service. 100% recommend."
ChIJ8UGta5gpQg0RG2AoG96zjW4,5,Great value for money! The pizza is nice and the service is also nice and for the price is well worth a visit!
ChIJ8UGta5gpQg0RG2AoG96zjW4,5,"Best pizza in Madrid, feels like you are eating pizza from Italy. Real pizza"
ChIJ8UGta5gpQg0RG2AoG96zjW4,4,Good
ChIJ8UGta5gpQg0RG2AoG96zjW4,5,"Nice pizza, good service and cheep prices. Recommended!"
ChIJP1xeep8pQg0Rn0ed5YkKVrA,5,"Great food and well kept beer in a nice, quiet & serene street. We had artichoke with Parmesan to start and shared some ribs for main, both of which were delicious. Great staff & the owner is friendly & speaks fluent English, which was helpful. We‚Äôve been before and we will definitely return."
ChIJP1xeep8pQg0Rn0ed5YkKVrA,4,"A bar that feels like home. The attention is spectacular. The portions are great, they are large and you can see the quality of the food they use. Also for the summer it has a large terrace where you can have a drink quietly.

As a negative point, they do not have a physical menu and when the waiter tells you the portions, you do not know the prices."
ChIJP1xeep8pQg0Rn0ed5YkKVrA,5,"Very good place to have a wine or a beer accompanied by a tapa or portion. Exquisite ham and cabrales croquettes, as well as artichoke flowers with foie. Site added to our ""favorites"" list"
ChIJP1xeep8pQg0Rn0ed5YkKVrA,5,"Very good place to have a few beers with your friends and very cheap. Super recommended, I am from Mexico and they gave me very good drinks."
ChIJP1xeep8pQg0Rn0ed5YkKVrA,5,"We usually come as much as we can, good treatment and the best tortilla in all of Madrid. Highly recommended!"
ChIJq6qm0KcpQg0R5aEAnhxfoAE,1,I ordered menu with drinks for take out but they didn‚Äôt put the drinks on it
ChIJq6qm0KcpQg0R5aEAnhxfoAE,1,Bad service at the counter.
ChIJq6qm0KcpQg0R5aEAnhxfoAE,1,"I ordered a pizza online and paid by card, they charged me but never delivered the pizza! 8 calls to the shop and they didn't answer. I went into the shop today to complain and the guy had the cheek to ask me if I still wanted the pizza.. are you kidding bro"
ChIJq6qm0KcpQg0R5aEAnhxfoAE,1,"The delivery is too late, 1 hour late and when I call they don‚Äôt answer the call too bad"
ChIJq6qm0KcpQg0R5aEAnhxfoAE,3,The food was really nice but the problem was the restaurant was very small there was only two tables and the toilet was not that clean.
ChIJATAtU-YpQg0RBBAmtqidsiY,5,"Small but cozy. And without a doubt with the attention of Raquel or Javi, the ideal place for any type of celebration. Thank you for your kindness and patience üòä"
ChIJATAtU-YpQg0RBBAmtqidsiY,5,"There is no waitress like Raquel. If there is a word that defines it, it is excellence. Congratulations"
ChIJATAtU-YpQg0RBBAmtqidsiY,5,Raquel and Javi are the best waiters in the world üåé they are wonderful and the service has been incredible
ChIJATAtU-YpQg0RBBAmtqidsiY,5,
ChIJ63dMUQApQg0Rh4Q2Gp9Jf2E,5,"We went yesterday for my birthday and everything seemed excellent, we ordered a barbecue for 4 people, there were 5 of us and we still left meat (we eat a lot). The place is very spacious and has a very nice theme. We will definitely repeat and recommend it."
ChIJ63dMUQApQg0Rh4Q2Gp9Jf2E,5,"A very good place to eat
We were there today with my husband and we really liked it.
The attention, the food, the 5-star atmosphere I give it a 10! We will return"
ChIJ63dMUQApQg0Rh4Q2Gp9Jf2E,5,"On January 7 we went with some friends for dinner, of different nationalities and we were delighted, it's a shame I already had dinner and I was eager to try more things, the service was great, all the waiters were very attentive, the place is beautiful, the bathroom very clean (personally for me it speaks volumes about a place), recommendation! Don't look at the bad reviews, visit and draw your own conclusions, we will return!"
ChIJ63dMUQApQg0Rh4Q2Gp9Jf2E,5,"We went to eat with my family, and my 8-year-old daughter was super delighted with the food and the place.
Super good attention!!! without a doubt we will return!!!"
ChIJ63dMUQApQg0Rh4Q2Gp9Jf2E,2,"Food from my country, which unfortunately lacked a lot of flavor in everything, the cassava was cold and hard, at least serve it warm and of the day, the service was very good, the place was very nice, but the food left a lot to be desired."
ChIJqSJ3wLgpQg0RgCuTJDtpomY,5,"I‚Äôve got bubble tea and yakisoba, both very tasty! Service was great!"
ChIJqSJ3wLgpQg0RgCuTJDtpomY,5,"very good boba, I got the k3 milk, brown sugar and tapioca tea and have been getting delivery for years now, good selection, some vegan and vegetarian good options"
ChIJqSJ3wLgpQg0RgCuTJDtpomY,1,The service is okay but the bubble tea is actually quite expensive plus bad taste(super sweet)! Some of the options are even over 7‚Ç¨( more expensive than a lot of bubble tea shops in center.) it‚Äôs my first time to this shop also it‚Äôs gonna be my last time. Not recommended!
ChIJqSJ3wLgpQg0RgCuTJDtpomY,5,Really tasty food and very nice bubble tea with lots of different flavours to choose from. Good prices.
ChIJqSJ3wLgpQg0RgCuTJDtpomY,5,Absolutely love it! Very cozy place with very tasty boba c:
ChIJ78t4E58pQg0R175EMLHmr-o,5,Lovely
ChIJ78t4E58pQg0R175EMLHmr-o,5,Great sushi spot!
ChIJ78t4E58pQg0R175EMLHmr-o,5,"By chance looking for a restaurant to eat Sushi, we stopped here and honestly had the best sushi platters I have ever had. High product quality, they make it for you on the go. The place is not the most attractive but the service was excellent. And we will repeat when we pass by here. I am sorry that the trays in the photo are incomplete. It's worth it. I hope it encourages you to enter despite the appearance."
ChIJ78t4E58pQg0R175EMLHmr-o,4,"Spectacular Chinese family restaurant in the Barrio del Pilar. Super reasonable prices, super large quantities and delicious food. The noodles are the small version. The treatment is super friendly from all the waiters. The only downside is that they are few and it takes them a while to serve you the food."
ChIJ78t4E58pQg0R175EMLHmr-o,5,"It is a very small place, hidden and does not attract attention, but if you like real, quality sushi, with real fresh fish, this is your place. I have been trying sushi for years in different cities in Spain and honestly, this is the one that has the best flavor, best texture and highest quality of all the ones I have tried. Incredible. The only bad thing is that the place is quite dark and has no atmosphere, but you can order delivery and they will prepare it for you at the moment (no sushi already prepared before). Additionally, depending on the money you spend, they give you products that you can choose from."
ChIJrRVYR5gpQg0R-h9MlC-fojE,5,"Wonderful spot for breakfast. The man working was fast, efficient, and friendly. Fresh breakfast, fresh pastries, fresh coffee - all so delicious. Prices were so cheap"
ChIJrRVYR5gpQg0R-h9MlC-fojE,5,"Good food, nice people and really affordable. Worth going"
ChIJrRVYR5gpQg0R-h9MlC-fojE,5,Delicious!
ChIJrRVYR5gpQg0R-h9MlC-fojE,1,"Rosi has gotten older, does not control the business well and is no longer competent.  The quality of all their dishes has dropped considerably and the positive reviews are from 2 years ago. Today customers are disenchanted and only give negative ratings and what most come are workers from the neighborhood to eat the mid-day menu because the most demanding people have changed to others that are better."
ChIJrRVYR5gpQg0R-h9MlC-fojE,5,"Traditional cafe/bar/restaurant in the neighborhood, with a pleasant location and closed terrace, good atmosphere, excellent service and friendly staff. It is eaten quite well. Perfect for hanging out with some tapas. 100% recommended."
ChIJ7a1t2hEpQg0Rj38EtjiBeY8,4,"Went there a few times.

There's usually available seats (in other Domino's stores there are not oftentimes).

Between 4 and 7 in the afternoon, there is the Happy Hour (""All you can eat"" even more discounted), even if not advertised.

The last time I went, the door of the toilet was locked. Quite annoying. Do I really have to ask for the keys every time I want to use the toilet? It wasn't that clean anyway...

I only eat one kind of pizza and I usually enjoy going here.

Without ""All you can eat"", it looks like a very expensive place. I don't think it'd be usually worth it without that option..."
ChIJ7a1t2hEpQg0Rj38EtjiBeY8,5,Always best place for pizza's and some vegetarian options available.
ChIJ7a1t2hEpQg0Rj38EtjiBeY8,4,"One of the best Domino's Pizza restaurants I have ever been. The place is quite spacious and it was quite clean compared to others. The service was great, specially Nicole. She was very kind with us"
ChIJ7a1t2hEpQg0Rj38EtjiBeY8,5,"The service was very kind and helpful, especially Henry the one who served us. Place is clean and the food was great. A very friendly experience"
ChIJ7a1t2hEpQg0Rj38EtjiBeY8,5,Great experience and fantastic pizza. Staff were brilliant and helpful especially Henry who went above and beyond and was also able to speak english. Highly recommend!
ChIJu5xXTw8pQg0RD09vr4DtMQ8,3,"Stopped in on a rainy night for dinner . The atmosphere is fair. They have it decorated to give a lounge vibe but the cases of beer and water lining the bar take away from the aesthetic. And that I am willing to overlook if the food was exceptional. But unfortunately it was a far cry from that
We ordered the fish soup which was essentially the pho broth with barely any seafood added. The majority was artificial crab and shards of unrecognizable sea food. The entire bowl had barely a teaspoonful . The broth was tasty but not worth the 4.50 they are charging
The fried egg rolls were tiny and had barely any filling.
The main courses were fair but forgettable. We ordered the noodles with rice which was fair but had this overly sweet dressing. The shrimp and rice was just 3 shrimp cut length wise and dropped in some sweet chili sauce out of a bottle.
The pork ribs were tender but not spicy and in a brown gravy.
All in all a very disappointing experience . Very small portions of food  and definitely not worth the price they charge.
I would give it a miss."
ChIJu5xXTw8pQg0RD09vr4DtMQ8,4,"Decent food, good service. I think the added sushi options at this place are excessive. My friend had some sushi and was not impressed by it. Vietnamese is clearly the forte of this place.

I had some mixed pho, and it was fairly good. I would have loved to see a bit bigger portion, though."
ChIJu5xXTw8pQg0RD09vr4DtMQ8,5,"100% authentic Vietnamese foods, we love nems and bun cha. Good price for quality"
ChIJu5xXTw8pQg0RD09vr4DtMQ8,4,"Overall a positive experience. Local is relatively small so be sure to book in advance. Staff was friendly and helpful. Average prices.
Cannot vouch for authenticity of the food but we enjoyed it."
ChIJu5xXTw8pQg0RD09vr4DtMQ8,5,"Everything is wonderful. Perfect experience! Good service, authentic vietnamese food"
ChIJWesduw8pQg0RFdyrB8xrJf0,5,"The position is inside the Vi√±a Virgen Gallery. Great variety of products, chicken (Coren) of great quality. I also love their spring rolls and turkey fillets with paprika. Excellent treatment by Ram√≥n and Luis."
ChIJWesduw8pQg0RFdyrB8xrJf0,5,"Excellent quality, as well as the treatment of Ram√≥n and the rest of the team. I place orders over the phone with the peace of mind that everything they are going to give me is great. I recommend it with my eyes closed."
ChIJWesduw8pQg0RFdyrB8xrJf0,5,"Good variety, good prices, super clean, you shouldn't miss the Iberian ham croquettes and the prawns with gabardine, top-notch, traditional poultry."
ChIJWesduw8pQg0RFdyrB8xrJf0,5,"Huge variety, exquisite treatment and great quality in all products"
ChIJWesduw8pQg0RFdyrB8xrJf0,5,"Traditional neighborhood chicken shop, quality products and unbeatable service from Ram√≥n."
ChIJsweWfQ8pQg0RqhWW_862zcc,3,"Not a tapas bar. It's more a cervecer√≠a with sandwiches, combination plates, etc. The service we got here was much less friendly than the service at their other location a few blocks away (Gago III). Menu is the same at both.
Nothing stunning about the food, but things were cooked fresh and brought out hot. Lots of seating.
We had a club sandwich plate, a pig ear bocadillo, and a bottle of water for 16‚Ç¨."
ChIJsweWfQ8pQg0RqhWW_862zcc,5,Exquisite food! The paletilla de cordero was one of the best I have tried! Not expensive. Recommend it if u want to try topical Spanish food!the menu of the day is very good and afortable!
ChIJsweWfQ8pQg0RqhWW_862zcc,4,"Excellent quality tapas bar, though a little pricey."
ChIJsweWfQ8pQg0RqhWW_862zcc,5,Friendly staff and quick service. Loved how the waiter would shout the orders to the bar. Really cute
ChIJsweWfQ8pQg0RqhWW_862zcc,5,"Smells like a lot of history and tradition. It can't be much more Spanish. Either breakfast, lunch, dinner or just a drink ‚Äì try it. Not super cheap, but prizes are still okay."
ChIJE-yeeA8pQg0RGcxkkOe-mgw,5,Loved it. Especially the guy from Paraguay makes delicious pizzas!!!! Value for money. Very large pizzas for 5‚Ç¨!
ChIJE-yeeA8pQg0RGcxkkOe-mgw,2,I've ordered 2 pizzas: pepperoni Napoli decent but the caprichosa was terrible. Ingredients were not add to the pizza in the proper way and not cooked. Was like a margherita with the ingredients added in the end.
ChIJE-yeeA8pQg0RGcxkkOe-mgw,3,"Great price, fast and good delivery. Unfortunately, in a blind taste test, I would probably identify this one as the cheapest."
ChIJE-yeeA8pQg0RGcxkkOe-mgw,3,Okay pizzas for the price. Thin crust which is good.
ChIJE-yeeA8pQg0RGcxkkOe-mgw,4,Good food.  Service could be improved.
ChIJp2C5OhApQg0RhsIIsIUL0dU,5,"If your are in Tetuan/Plaza de pa Castilla area, and looking for a great pub (kind of irish style), local owned, good craft beers and drinks, with great people and owners, good music,  just make a favor to yourself and come here.

What a  Super place, with local vibe and great relation/atmosphere between customers. Open till 3am.

Will be be back here anytime i come to Madrid.

(P.s here the local people bring the dogs, very pet-friendly and warm place - you feel like family, in a great pub)

Gracias"
ChIJp2C5OhApQg0RhsIIsIUL0dU,4,"It's a quaint little pub with comfy sofas, country pub feeling, darts and a nice billiard table. The beer is a bit pricey, but it's a nice place"
ChIJp2C5OhApQg0RhsIIsIUL0dU,5,Very nice and cozy! Great drinks and shots! Things to play and entertain!
ChIJp2C5OhApQg0RhsIIsIUL0dU,5,"Very nice and cozy!
Great service!"
ChIJp2C5OhApQg0RhsIIsIUL0dU,2,Only thing I could find open at 1am on a Wednesday. A bit pricey. Has a pool table
ChIJW8yp4A8pQg0Rkx_qAhGuCxQ,5,"Cozy place, good coffee. My kids enjoyed the hot chocolate. You will be served in a nice way."
ChIJW8yp4A8pQg0Rkx_qAhGuCxQ,4,The food was great! The coffee with pistachio cream was yummy!!
ChIJW8yp4A8pQg0Rkx_qAhGuCxQ,4,"Food was great, fresh and delicious and coffee was p e r f e c t. The service was quick but the waitress was moody and wasn‚Äôt a great welcome back to the city I called home for 8 years"

ChIJW8yp4A8pQg0Rkx_qAhGuCxQ,4,Great food and ambiance.. but a little bit hot inside the cafe.. maybe the AC was not turned on during the time we visit.
ChIJpct0IhApQg0RWUvPBWj601E,1,"Go to the Domino's instead.
It's not far away and it's much more convenient and fair, with more than a pizza that you can order at a time.

Drinks are also way better organized. Not one bottle for everyone, but a glass each (at the Domino's).

Also, at the Domino's you have a bigger variety of ingredients, and the toilet is free to use, in the sense that you don't have to ask for the damn key to get access to the toilet.

Compared to the Domino's, this is pretty much garbage..."
ChIJpct0IhApQg0RWUvPBWj601E,5,"Great people , serve great pizza üçï... love it. Very quick service ."
ChIJpct0IhApQg0RWUvPBWj601E,4,vegetarian pizza would be available if you can explain the ingredients
ChIJpct0IhApQg0RWUvPBWj601E,1,Yep. They did it. Worst pizza I ever tasted
ChIJpct0IhApQg0RWUvPBWj601E,4,Ok pizza !!
ChIJg9FVIhApQg0RA-OYfw-J0tY,5,"We came here by chance while looking for a place to have a snack with coffee after leaving the hotel. We ordered pizza upon the chef's recommendation, it was really delicious and nice."
ChIJg9FVIhApQg0RA-OYfw-J0tY,5,"The pizza is better than pizza in Italy. I've ate both. Not a busy area but great food, good service, beer on tap."
ChIJg9FVIhApQg0RA-OYfw-J0tY,5,Awesome Italian place. The service was really good and caring. The fresh pasta was really good but you are hungry I recommend getting a pizza (as you get more food for the same price). The pizza La Forchetta was really good
ChIJg9FVIhApQg0RA-OYfw-J0tY,4,Got a margarita pizza.  Tasted good.  Service was nice and friendly. Priced well too. No complaints.
ChIJg9FVIhApQg0RA-OYfw-J0tY,5,"Seafood Pizza üçï made with love and fresh ingredients
Professional service and experience
Thank you !"
ChIJ25KSWQUpQg0RFSAFfj3ArTk,5,"We were on the hunt for the best margarita between Italy and Spain, and found this!"
ChIJ25KSWQUpQg0RFSAFfj3ArTk,5,"Cafeteria, para desayunar una de las tortillas m√°s exquisitas de la zona y como no su super barrita de aceite y tomate recomendableal üíØx üíØ, su cocinera es Lina que lo hace todo con suma dedicaci√≥n y cari√±o. Y luego estan Natalia y Daniela las m√° guapas y simpaticas del lugar, gracias a ellas la Rebiela es un magnifico sitio para desayunar o tomarte un men√∫ del d√≠a .y pasar un agradable rato con amigos o compa√±eros de Trabajo.Ya sabeis si estais de pasada o trabajais por la Zona no dudeis de visitarlas os tratar√°n como en casa."
ChIJ25KSWQUpQg0RFSAFfj3ArTk,5,"Today I had breakfast/lunch in this bar, since it was late I ordered a vegetable sandwich, the photo you are going to see is the smallest one, it is better to ask so they can explain it to you and choose depending on your hunger... served by Natalia, very nice, kind and fast. They didn't take long to serve us and it was very delicious and well loaded...I ordered an aquarium to drink and it was served with a slice of lemon, which I appreciate because I like it as is. You can see cleanliness in the place, which is important to me... the only thing, in my opinion, is to tell them that they try to leave the sweeping for when there are no people or there is an urgent need because they raise dust from the floor and with food on the table it is not pleasant. All the best."
ChIJ25KSWQUpQg0RFSAFfj3ArTk,5,"I tried the menu of the day and it was super delicious, and they also treated me fantastically. I have yet to return to try the omelette!"
ChIJ25KSWQUpQg0RFSAFfj3ArTk,5,"Discovered a few months ago, an ideal place for breakfast/lunch and facing a workday. Excellent service and a spectacular omelette and delicious sandwiches. Thank you M¬™ Luz"
ChIJYeiyRBApQg0RlZkFjsVBYeg,1,"A shame for the driver who today on the highway was going 150 right behind all the cars, why was the man in a hurry or do I know why? I don't understand why there are still people like that and why it isn't done with people like that. The worst of all is that the boss will know and will remain the same and will not say anything or take action against the attack on road safety. And the best of all is that if he has an accident, it will be the other person's fault, not him.
It's a shame that people like this continue driving and thank God I was able to take a photo of the vehicle attached to something else that I won't publish because I'm sure they'll act offended. And for data protection, otherwise I would put it because it is a shame."
ChIJYeiyRBApQg0RlZkFjsVBYeg,1,"I put one star because less would be a crime, like the one they are committing by not having complaint forms.

From the depths of hell they bring us to their service of waiters, impertinent, rude and with a desire to die greater than the food they serve. And I say food because people eat it, but I would rather vomit and feed on it again than on the soles of old sneakers."
ChIJYeiyRBApQg0RlZkFjsVBYeg,1,At the UAM Faculty of Medicine the price is increasingly higher and the quality lower. There has come a point where inflation is just an excuse to continue making more and more profits.
ChIJYeiyRBApQg0RlZkFjsVBYeg,1,"The new automatic machines for change in the architecture school (and I suppose in all the places where they have put them) are GARBAGE. Who would think of putting these devices in already crowded cafeterias, as slow and problematic as they are?
I hope you remove them and make life a little easier for all of us users and your staff."
ChIJYeiyRBApQg0RlZkFjsVBYeg,1,"In relation to the one awarded in the E.U.I.T.T, I will say that the quality is bad, the waiters are not friendly, they serve you as if they were sparing your life, the reaction time when serving is very bad given that the students have an hour to eat and half an hour is wasted trying to order a sad sandwich with soda where sometimes the waiter even forgets, other times where after waiting for half an hour they send people who come from outside and who have nothing to do with the university.

The quality of the food is conspicuous by its absence, and the treatment, as I have mentioned, is terrible, the services are neglected and the machines, although it says that they are maintained by Ramiro, if you go to the cafeteria to complain that he has swallowed the coin, he reluctantly returns the money saying that those machines are not his."
ChIJi2hSeA8pQg0RO6yYIWyw5S4,4,"Decent restaurant near Plaza Castilla. The owner was very nice. The complimentary torrenos (fried pork belly with chicharrons, comp) was out of this world! The other food was solid with the usual some great/some good mix. The Croquetas Jamon and the rabbit was pretty good. The rabbit dish portion was huge. The Patatas Bravas needed more frying. And unfortunately, we just had really good Pinchos Moruno elsewhere so these weren‚Äôt as good."
ChIJi2hSeA8pQg0RO6yYIWyw5S4,5,Very good atmosphere. That day we arrived very late. The staffs are friendly. They are eager to provide information and explain to us how the dishes will be cooked. The food are delicious.
ChIJi2hSeA8pQg0RO6yYIWyw5S4,5,Everything i ordered was good but the shrimps and dessert were the best. But the best thing about this place was the Filipino server who took very good care of me.
ChIJi2hSeA8pQg0RO6yYIWyw5S4,5,"Love this neighborhood spot that's apparently historical but also has a modern feel. Relatively calm on weekdays but totally packed on weekends, with people spilling out onto the sidewalk outside. Free tapas with your extremely reasonably priced ca√±a - a small bit of torreznos, or maybe some tortilla on bread. They're known for their torreznos, which are ridiculously crunchy, almost to a fault.
As of June 22, they have not reopened after the lockdown. Hope they come back soon!"
ChIJi2hSeA8pQg0RO6yYIWyw5S4,4,"Since 1934, a good immersion in the traditional Madrid bar"
ChIJ-xFspBEpQg0RFoISypIt2Ws,1,"in 3 years living next to this restaurant, there was NEVER a time where all the food was perfect. Every SINGLE time: item forgotten or wrong item or (the most common) cold/old food. Moreover, if they have a promotion with a bottle or towel or whatever, you ALWAYS need to ask for it, otherwise they 'forget'. Even if you ask, there is a 50% chance 'they ran out' 2 days after promotion started.
edit: i've got a response from McDonald's: 'we hope next time it will be better'
How about you actually improve, instead of just hoping. In 3 years it went from bad to worse, and now you 'hope next time will be better'?  Living in your own universe, i guess. There will be no 'next time', thanks very much for the crap quality. I've had enough."
ChIJ-xFspBEpQg0RFoISypIt2Ws,3,"Good food.

But not only do they not put a straw, but they also put a ton of ice..."
ChIJ-xFspBEpQg0RFoISypIt2Ws,2,"Ordered crispy chicken with bbq sauce. Chicken was more crispy than expected, almost burned and dry. The bread was plain and overall it felt burger made without any passion for it."
ChIJ-xFspBEpQg0RFoISypIt2Ws,1,"Employees were extremely slow. They were just walking around, and we waited for our order for 17 minutes in an empty restaurant! I haven't eaten anything today, so i was so excited to eat my double cheeseburger and guess what, THEY FORGOT TO PUT IT IN THE BAG!! I paid for it, and i really wanted it. They ruined my mood. I don't recommend this place if you just want to enjoy your cheeseburger"
ChIJ-xFspBEpQg0RFoISypIt2Ws,5,alex is very kind and i hope they see his efforts and give him a promotion. 10/10
ChIJoeTeDxEpQg0RAbPH3M137mw,5,"I went to Taco Bell when I was in Madrid on the 14th of December! I had gone there for dinner.
It was the first time that I e ever tried Taco Bell and the wraps that I ordered were extremely delicious!! The bacon topped cheesy fries were the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. The chocolate cake was delicious too! Overall my experience at Taco Bell was great!! Definitely a 10/10 experience!!"
ChIJoeTeDxEpQg0RAbPH3M137mw,1,"This how the food was served today. The taco isn‚Äôt cooked well and when asked them, the counter guy says it will be like that only."
ChIJoeTeDxEpQg0RAbPH3M137mw,5,"Much better than those in the states,  this is a very nice place to eat,  very friendly staffs,  everyone was very kind"
ChIJoeTeDxEpQg0RAbPH3M137mw,4,"I liked the mexican food, I like it spicy. The fried potatos were great !! I will go there again!!"
ChIJoeTeDxEpQg0RAbPH3M137mw,1,"The location is very good and easily accessible. The ambience is quite attractive and pleasant.
It doesn‚Äôt have any special play areas unlike Burger King and popeys.
The service is worst, there are only 2 self ordering kiosk and they barely work properly. And the counter billing takes lot of time and it took 30mins for us to order 2meals."
ChIJR7EBigUpQg0RilbVQ8tdp-o,4,"Nice Spanish and international food, with exceptional prices."
ChIJR7EBigUpQg0RilbVQ8tdp-o,4,Good burguer and tostas for reasonable price
ChIJR7EBigUpQg0RilbVQ8tdp-o,4,Delicious food and excellent service
ChIJR7EBigUpQg0RilbVQ8tdp-o,4,Best tortilla in Madrid
ChIJR7EBigUpQg0RilbVQ8tdp-o,5,"I have had breakfast and everything was delicious, the service was friendly and the price was very good, but I have recently been to the restaurant a couple of times and the food has surprised me, everything was very delicious, homemade and of quality, one of the best menus in the neighborhood. I recommend the delicious and homemade desserts."
ChIJu_cfaREpQg0R6pna0bOA10c,5,"Found this nice restaurant randomly close to my new home in Madrid.
If you wanna taste a real homemade Spanish food they have it!!!
100% recommendable
The service is excelent, the owner is really funny and you have a great time there :)"
ChIJu_cfaREpQg0R6pna0bOA10c,5,"Nice bar for locals, friendly service.  fresh food. cold beerüòÑ‚úåüèª‚ÄºÔ∏è"
ChIJu_cfaREpQg0R6pna0bOA10c,5,Fantastic service and food. Plus great value for money. The staff where extremely friendly and helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.
ChIJu_cfaREpQg0R6pna0bOA10c,5,"Very good local bar. Kind and pleasant service.
Seating on two floors and also outside."
ChIJu_cfaREpQg0R6pna0bOA10c,5,True local place with kind staff and good prices
ChIJ2e3PUg4pQg0RWG45LHtvKy0,5,"Great menu of the day. A good neighborhood bar that no longer exists, all homemade, charming and great prices. Special mention for the mandarin juice, superb."
ChIJ2e3PUg4pQg0RWG45LHtvKy0,4,"Very good. It has a great variety of tapas and has some cheeses with a spectacular tip! A good place for breakfast, lunch, dinner or simply to have a round with a couple of tapas. Although it is very close to the Atocha station, it retains the air of a traditional bar and tavern. Average price for bars of this style in Madrid."
ChIJ2e3PUg4pQg0RWG45LHtvKy0,5,"Good old fashioned food. Menu at 9.50.
There was a little lack of air conditioning."
ChIJ2e3PUg4pQg0RWG45LHtvKy0,5,The best neighborhood bar and restaurant. All the reviews that appear are true and fall short. It is a pleasure to come.
ChIJ2e3PUg4pQg0RWG45LHtvKy0,5,"Clean, family atmosphere, the food was wonderful and abundant, the ratatouille was very delicious and the beef steak too. The very nice lady

Thank you very much, I will return."
ChIJ3fHLPxEpQg0RYKuziNpFPsI,5,"I wasn't sure about the place when passing by everyday. I decided to visit and try for takeaway.
I ordered burgers Principe Pio and sandwich mixto all in menus with fries and drinks.
Very good customer service, asking all details, perfect!
When tried my burger at home I was amazed how good it was, perfect size, meet so yummy! Just perfect, so different from all my other favourite places.
Fries so tasty, delicious.

Today again I decided to have it, and it was even better!!! Again customer service spotless and professional all perfectly packed.

I also like the fact that the place is accepting different ways of payment including Amex and cheques gourmet, which is great.

I will be visiting often."
ChIJ3fHLPxEpQg0RYKuziNpFPsI,4,Ordered one of their hot dogs and it was really yummy. It was also rather pricey.
ChIJ3fHLPxEpQg0RYKuziNpFPsI,5,"Good food, friendly service, good prices."
ChIJ3fHLPxEpQg0RYKuziNpFPsI,1,"If there was a -3 stars that's what I would rate, the cashier was very rude, my order was raw, when I went back to politely see if they could cook the meat for me the guy was rude and snatched my order from hand and threw it in the trash. While I was waiting outside and glancing in to see ify order was almost ready I caught the cook spitting in my food. Absolutely horrible service."
ChIJ3fHLPxEpQg0RYKuziNpFPsI,5,Nice!
ChIJA98VlxopQg0R1AxIRKL5IUA,4,"It is worth stopping to have a coffee at the meeting, there is a collection of cash register machines that Emilio collected when he opened this place. It is a very quiet place and also has a covered terrace that overlooks the old Captain Haya street, which is very pleasant."
ChIJA98VlxopQg0R1AxIRKL5IUA,5,"The best place to eat by the pool, they were very fast serving the food, homemade cuisine and quality products, the service from the waiters was excellent. To repeat without a doubt. Suitable for celiacs since I am one and they were very attentive with that. A complete success"
ChIJA98VlxopQg0R1AxIRKL5IUA,5,"Excellent service, the food is delicious, good price, quiet place to have beers and some good tapas, Emilio is a 10-rated waiter, to return again and again."
ChIJA98VlxopQg0R1AxIRKL5IUA,5,"We go almost every week to have a drink after work. A perfect place to have a good time and with incredible treatment. Emilio is super attentive and professional, a charm. Super recommended"
ChIJA98VlxopQg0R1AxIRKL5IUA,5,"My favorite place in Plaza Castilla. The prices are reasonable. The potato omelette is incredible. The service is great, both Emilio and any waiter who was there when I went have always treated me great."
ChIJv9xWJp4pQg0R43nlVrpUqQ4,4,"Small place but worth it to go to breakfast. Few things but what they have is made well and at a good price. The large, freshly made tortilla skewer. If I lived in the area I would like to be a regular customer"
ChIJv9xWJp4pQg0R43nlVrpUqQ4,3,"Good breakfast with orange juice. They serve you wonderfully on the terrace, which gives a little air in summer and is in the shade."
ChIJv9xWJp4pQg0R43nlVrpUqQ4,5,Perfect for breakfast and an aperitif! Sunbathe on the terrace and they serve you great! The best is the service and their tortilla skewers :)
ChIJv9xWJp4pQg0R43nlVrpUqQ4,5,We ended up there by chance for breakfast after a trip and were pleasantly surprised. Great treatment. Delicious breakfasts and at a great price. If I return to Madrid it will be my breakfast place
ChIJv9xWJp4pQg0R43nlVrpUqQ4,5,"For work I ended up stopping to have a coffee and my surprise was such that I decided to leave a review. Wonderful staff and very good attention. If I return to this area I will stop by without hesitation, thank you very much ü§ó"
ChIJTXXEOhEpQg0RYDYYenQPrPM,4,We had coffee which was delicious and two pastries one with custard-like cream and the other with some dried fruit. The latter wasn‚Äôt very tasty. The staff were ok although they didn‚Äôt seem very happy about our umbrellas. It was on a rainy day and there was no umbrella rack/stand by the door ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
ChIJTXXEOhEpQg0RYDYYenQPrPM,5,"Lovely ladies and great coffee! Tasty food, clean place. Reasonable prices."
ChIJTXXEOhEpQg0RYDYYenQPrPM,1,"Terrible coffee, good looking pastries, awful taste. Avoid!"
ChIJTXXEOhEpQg0RYDYYenQPrPM,4,"Enjoyed my coffee & muffin here chilling out in the terrace. The three waitresses were all really efficient and friendly. Service was quick & they have a fantastic selection of cakes, sandwiches etc. Free Wi-Fi too."
ChIJTXXEOhEpQg0RYDYYenQPrPM,2,What happened to the magic of having a coffee here?
ChIJ9Y1SJBEpQg0RgSxiGT7ip1U,3,Food was bellow average. I got a salmon wrap and almond croissant. Not that tasty. Atmosphere and service was fine.
ChIJ9Y1SJBEpQg0RgSxiGT7ip1U,5,Very good breakfast and very reasonably priced. Try the zumo vita!
ChIJ9Y1SJBEpQg0RgSxiGT7ip1U,2,"It makes no sense to close this store at 17:00. No sense at all. Besides that, staff on this store is usually very junior. So annoying."
ChIJ9Y1SJBEpQg0RgSxiGT7ip1U,5,"A nice ambience in a well located spot, where I like to come back frequently. The smoothies are great and the staff is always very friendly (also early in the mornings!)"
ChIJ9Y1SJBEpQg0RgSxiGT7ip1U,5,Great place for breakfast with a variety of combinations at low prices.
ChIJa2W9QQ8pQg0RKXoG_lAzjRA,5,It's a good place to have some beers and the daily menu is fantastic
ChIJa2W9QQ8pQg0RKXoG_lAzjRA,5,When I hobble myself with wine I am enduced to misrember my keys. I am therefore grateful that the kitchen at this establishment is open from 8pm which half an hour earlier than the cultural average.
ChIJa2W9QQ8pQg0RKXoG_lAzjRA,5,The attention and the octopus was great
ChIJa2W9QQ8pQg0RKXoG_lAzjRA,5,Expectacular
ChIJa2W9QQ8pQg0RKXoG_lAzjRA,5,"A very good dining experience. Ordered 2 portions of fish and it was very delicious. The boss also gave me a small portion of paella and bread. The fish is fresh and the price is beautiful. The boss is nice, but he doesn't know much English."
ChIJb4Pm2A8pQg0RQeRLwLj5ydQ,5,"Excellent food, thank you for the lovely evening - and Valentine's Day. A restaurant in Madrid that appreciates traditional cuisine. We felt very comfortable and enjoyed ourselves."
ChIJb4Pm2A8pQg0RQeRLwLj5ydQ,5,"Tucked away on a quiet street with a few tables outside, Burela restaurant offers a great variety of fish dishes and amazing fresh crabs, lobsters and shellfish. As we enjoyed a complimentary dish of mussels the owner explained to us the menu and showed us the uncooked shellfish to help us make our selection. Service was friendly and efficient and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Price worked out at ‚Ç¨80 for 2, including appetizers, main course and a drink. A great neighborhood fish restaurant."
ChIJb4Pm2A8pQg0RQeRLwLj5ydQ,4,"Good place to eat seafood and fish, in a traditional dining room. We ate some very fresh prawns, but which, for my taste, were a little bland. Then a delicious Galician-style turbot and a seafood casserole, also very delicious. For dessert, the pancakes, especially the cream one, were spectacular, with a very original shape. The house white wine was also very correct. Prices in line with quality and attentive and professional service"
ChIJb4Pm2A8pQg0RQeRLwLj5ydQ,4,"Excellent quality-price Galician restaurant. The genre is fantastic and always recommends you honestly. I recommend the lobster salpic√≥n, the octopus and my favorite: the ‚Äúse√±oret‚Äù crab that comes clean and ready to enjoy (it is important to order it first, because its preparation takes a long time."
ChIJb4Pm2A8pQg0RQeRLwLj5ydQ,5,"Highly recommended! As an appetizer, some spectacular homemade mussels. The octopus, one of the best we have eaten. We also ordered empanada, Galician broth and Galician-style hake. all delicious. For dessert, I choose the pancakes. The service very good too. We will repeat without a doubt"
ChIJL9G51w8pQg0Rej7F_dV6lZI,5,"Simply put, the place and the lovely service. Their dishes are very attractive and delicious. A recommendable place. Tonight I repeat."
ChIJIeXBhQYpQg0RXWJey26rzvY,3,"Typical Madrid desayuno restaurant.  Nothing bad, nothing special.  Good prices.

I would go back."
ChIJIeXBhQYpQg0RXWJey26rzvY,3,"I only had breakfast here. It's good for a quick coffee break. Not so fancy, but good enough to serve its purpose."
ChIJIeXBhQYpQg0RXWJey26rzvY,4,Very quick service. Excellent food and massive portion sizes.
ChIJIeXBhQYpQg0RXWJey26rzvY,5,"Had breakfast and lunch on the same day. They have everything just ask, My choice of home food style was delicious üòã very warm staff  .."
ChIJIeXBhQYpQg0RXWJey26rzvY,4,"Closest thing to an American diner that I can imagine, with booth seating and a basic menu. Unlike an American diner, they serve ""hot dogs"" that look monstrous. No complaints about our tiny breakfast here.
The place is a bit worn down but has the interesting character of a former chain store turned into a neighborhood staple. They have outdoor seating in the nook that leads to Lidl but it's always shadowy and cold. Our waiter, a young guy, was very friendly and lively."
ChIJjyd-_wspQg0R0gsd_ViGn0M,5,"I really liked the place! We went for lunch. Since we are little familiar with Spanish cuisine, we asked the girl for advice. We ordered musaka, salm√≥n a la plancha and wine. The dishes were brought to us very quickly. Everything was very tasty, I especially liked the musaka."
ChIJjyd-_wspQg0R0gsd_ViGn0M,5,"An excellent bar, the service is very good, they are very friendly, the food is very good and affordable. It has a terrace and is renovated.
The menu varies, everything is very good, recommended.

ChIJjyd-_wspQg0R0gsd_ViGn0M,5,"A bar with a cozy atmosphere, impeccable service and a high-quality drinks menu. Without a doubt, a place that I will return to and recommend."
ChIJjyd-_wspQg0R0gsd_ViGn0M,5,"Bar restaurant of a lifetime!! Tapas, delicious homemade menu of the day, and the best of all, the family and professional treatment.
Right in front of the √öculo cultural center. In addition to the few places in the neighborhood that continue to put up some spectacular chickens and ins and outs!! So if you are going for a drink, a Sunday aperitif or the daily menu, a fantastic option.

Also incredible for having sandwiches or dining in the Informal Plan!!!"
ChIJjyd-_wspQg0R0gsd_ViGn0M,5,"Bar to eat some sandwiches, have some tapas, portions with beers, good atmosphere, perfect service üíØüëå"
ChIJBbau2OQpQg0RD7iF1pYkLsQ,5,"Divine! Without further ado, I always go for double the chop and my husband gets double the meat and friends! Recommended, we always go üëåüèΩü©∑ Flavor üôåüèº"
ChIJBbau2OQpQg0RD7iF1pYkLsQ,5,"It's the third time I've eaten here and the flavor of this place is really good. Today I was able to enjoy a delicious sancocho and I was bursting at the seams, I loved how soft the meat was, the amount of soup, the arepitas. Toooodoo. Great. Thank you so much!! We will continue to come back to taste everything else."
ChIJBbau2OQpQg0RD7iF1pYkLsQ,4,"The Frankenstein burger is very good. It is true that the treatment could improve, it is not the typical Venezuelan treatment. High prices like all Venezuelan food."
ChIJBbau2OQpQg0RD7iF1pYkLsQ,1,"Previously one of the best places to remember fast food in our country, but today I bought a special Venezuelan pepito and gosh, it was bad. The drop in quality is incredible. This has nothing to do with Don Julio. I am very sorry to lose a place like this, but I will not return again."
ChIJBbau2OQpQg0RD7iF1pYkLsQ,5,"Excelente como siempre, me gusta m√°s en lo personal el trato en las √°guilas, pero todos tenemos un mal d√≠a, aunque hay gestos que se pueden evitar, la calidad y la comida buena y acorde el precio con lo que te sirven. Recomendado siempre"
ChIJjUHzhRQpQg0RImfG_Ue1m3A,5,"It's my first time at this place, the calamari are an absolute MUST! I have never eaten more fresh and better made calamari. The staff are all super professional and polite. The guy who was cutting the Jamon was amazing, his name is LUIS, look out for him. This guy really looked after me and my fianc√©. The atmosphere and facilities were top notch. The price is reflective of the good food quality and amazing customer service. Highly recommend üëå we also got a yummy dessert üòçüòçüòç"
ChIJjUHzhRQpQg0RImfG_Ue1m3A,5,"Popped in for a quick lunch whilst passing through Madrid. Excellent seafood selection considering the location in the middle of the country. Jamon Iberico was delicious, as was the ensaladia, also tried a media of Berberechos, also excellent. Good selection of vinos and the waiter was very attentive and friendly."
ChIJjUHzhRQpQg0RImfG_Ue1m3A,5,Romantic place along Paseo de la Castellana. The tuna and tomato salad is out of this world. Nice wine list as well.
ChIJjUHzhRQpQg0RImfG_Ue1m3A,5,"An extraordinary place to eat and share very good moments with family.
Te food and service are  excellent,  and the atmosphere is perfect"
ChIJjUHzhRQpQg0RImfG_Ue1m3A,5,"great place to have quality seafood. the octopus and the soupy rice with lobsters are a must.

service is attentive and always ready."
ChIJfyqotBUpQg0RfXJdW611Llo,5,"The food was nice especially the soup, it warms us a lot during the cold weather back in November. It is not far away from Chamart√≠n Station, you can just walk and arrive quickly from there. Everything was fine, you should give it a try!"
ChIJfyqotBUpQg0RfXJdW611Llo,5,Food was great and the service was friendly. The price is also good value for money
ChIJfyqotBUpQg0RfXJdW611Llo,5,"We went there as a group of 12 people and it was honestly very good. We asked for a big table and they accommodated perfectly. The best food quality/price was the Pato Laqueado by far, we took the 4 people option and it was VERY good. We ate a lot and we were very satisfied. Other people also asked for the Sushi Variado and it was a good size as well. The gyozas were also good. Overall, we had a great dinner and I would come back again for sure."
ChIJfyqotBUpQg0RfXJdW611Llo,3,"Had to wait for service a long time every time, had to stop them to ask for things. One place mat was dirty and we were among the first people during the day. Food was edible. They didn‚Äôt de-vein the shrimp. One of the waitresses that came in later was nice, the other ones were nonchalant. The peking duck was good and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre getting 3 stars."
ChIJfyqotBUpQg0RfXJdW611Llo,4,"Very good asian restaurant. Very good value for money (buen trato! :D). For the daily menu you have different options, with different menus. I recommend the pato, arroz cantones and kubak de gambas. The staff is very kind and professional. The cheese cake is quite good as well. I recommend a visit."
ChIJ-wngCGspQg0RSEzZLkuFnIM,5,"The restaurant is on the 30th floor of one of the four towers in Madrid. The view from the restaurant is a beautiful overlooking Madrid.  Excelent food and service. Both tasting menu and a la carte options had well thought through and delecious food. There are plenty of fish, meat, and vegetarian options.  While we were there, a couple got engaged, so it is also a very romantic and festive place."
ChIJ-wngCGspQg0RSEzZLkuFnIM,5,"If you stay at Eurostars Hotel its restaurant is a must, for those that want to try a great experience it is recommended. Let's just say it is worth it, mid / high prices that are than justified on excellent service, great food an nice ambience. Good views at 30th floor of one of the four towers that have redefined the Madrid skyline. Extensive wines, well balanced food menu with traditional Castilian food. So what else?"
ChIJ-wngCGspQg0RSEzZLkuFnIM,5,"A group of 6, we all had an outstanding gastronomic experience on top of the Tower.
We enjoyed very much all dishes and the highlights were the tuna tataki along with the shrimp and scalop ceviche.
Service was accordingly excellent."
ChIJ-wngCGspQg0RSEzZLkuFnIM,5,"Great view, good Degustations menu friendly staff. Recommended"
ChIJ-wngCGspQg0RSEzZLkuFnIM,5,"30F, Great breakfast buffet(twentyfour)on one of Madrid's four tallest towers. Come early, maybe 8:30, to sit next to windows."
ChIJxyrVpRUpQg0RWP-FrB_bmiw,4,"Good restaurant located next to Chamart√≠n train station. It is probably better to have a sandwich or some tapas here than trying your luck with the bars inside the station. It might be a bit overpriced, but that is also because of the location. So if you haven‚Äôt planned your meal before going to the train station and have some time, this could be a good place. They also have TV where you could watch the football game if they are playing."
ChIJxyrVpRUpQg0RWP-FrB_bmiw,1,"Non professional service and extremely rude and disrespectful staff. We have not been offered the menu of the day against People arrived 10 minutes later was offered the menu (in a dodgy paper outside the main menu). Although it just served after 1pm (managers word, nothing mentioned in the regular menu) that could have been mentioned by the staff as soon as the waiter came over. Food is also too expensive for the quality. Upon complaining and explaining our point of view the manager was even more arrogant and with no intention to understand. That's not a proper way to look after customers."
ChIJxyrVpRUpQg0RWP-FrB_bmiw,2,"Very standard food for the prices, the tapas size were alright but it was very grease. Lots of oil on the bacon and the egg sandwich. Plus the atmosphere when there are some drunks clients pissing outside was not great."
ChIJxyrVpRUpQg0RWP-FrB_bmiw,4,"2 minute walk from the train station.  Good place for a drink and a snack while waiting for a train.

There is a sunny patio when the rain isn't on the plain."
ChIJxyrVpRUpQg0RWP-FrB_bmiw,1,They were not very nice. Food was expensive for the quality it had. I would go somewhere else.
ChIJf585GhQpQg0Rakjg0ErH8U0,5,"Great place a few blocks from the neighborhood train station. I loved the jam√≥n ib√©rico, calamari, and semi hard cheeses. Decent prices and nice to sit outdoors"
ChIJf585GhQpQg0Rakjg0ErH8U0,5,"I didn't take a picture of our burgers, because we had to catch a train and we asked them to make our burgers to-go.  However, the burgers were absolutely amazing. We were not there for very long, but the time we were there, we received amazing service."
ChIJf585GhQpQg0Rakjg0ErH8U0,3,"Place was ok, service was ok, better if you can speak the language. food was fine"
ChIJf585GhQpQg0Rakjg0ErH8U0,5,"Uncomplicated, tasty and very good value/huge portioned food. It‚Äôs not the first place you look at and think you want to go there to eat but I‚Äôd highly recommend a visit!"
ChIJf585GhQpQg0Rakjg0ErH8U0,4,Delicious food! üòç
ChIJndExtRQpQg0R2qNbkwOjV3M,5,Very nice local place for late breakfast. Delicious coffee. Very pleasant service.
ChIJndExtRQpQg0R2qNbkwOjV3M,4,"Very good for quick bite. The sandwich can not be heated, myself don't like the refrigerated food."
ChIJndExtRQpQg0R2qNbkwOjV3M,4,"Rodilla is a popular chain of sandwich shops in Madrid that serves a
variety of sandwiches, salads, and other quick bites.

The cafe has a cozy and inviting atmosphere, making it a great place to grab a quick bite or catch up with friends.

The staff are friendly and welcoming, and the service is efficient. The menu offers a wide variety of options, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Rodilla's food is fresh and tasty, with a variety of sandwiches, salads, and other quick bites to choose from.

The sandwiches are made with high-quality ingredients and are freshly prepared, making them a great option for a quick lunch or snack  and the coffee is also great.

They also have vegetarian and gluten-free options, catering to a wide range of dietary needs.
If you're in the mood for something sweet, they also have a variety of pastries and desserts to choose from.

Overall, Rodilla is a great choice if you're looking for delicious and convenient food or  a casual lunch or snack in Madrid."
ChIJndExtRQpQg0R2qNbkwOjV3M,4,"Happy with prices, interior is nice and cozy, only bad thing was that when I started speaking English, every barista had little attitude. Except that I had pleasant experience."
ChIJndExtRQpQg0R2qNbkwOjV3M,2,"Stopped through when traveling. The food is fine but not great, and imo a bit expensive for what it is. Was able to charge my phone because I found the one spot with an outlet."
ChIJ5dMaWRMpQg0RXnhhz-6svLo,5,"I love coffee shops that ask you if you want the coffee in a glass. I never say yes, I never order it in a glass, but I really like how classic it is to order coffee in a glass.

This is a traditional coffee shop, and I hope it never changes. There is good, cheap coffee and the place is very comfortable in the mornings."
ChIJ5dMaWRMpQg0RXnhhz-6svLo,1,"The place with the most nauseating food I have ever tasted in my entire life. Some health organization should check the healthiness of the place, because the appearance and taste of the ""beef"" they served me was repulsive. I had to order something else, that meat couldn't be in good condition. My companion, who tried it, confirmed my suspicions and almost spit the piece out of his mouth. The patatas bravas tasted like a mix between cardboard and dirt: innovative cuisine. Oh, and to make matters worse, they don't give you a ticket nor are there prices for the dishes anywhere, or at least I didn't see them."
ChIJ5dMaWRMpQg0RXnhhz-6svLo,4,"The menu of the day is ‚Ç¨12 (good for the area). I tried the lentils and grilled hake with salad. Includes drink, portion of bread and dessert. The outside terrace is large, inside it is small."
ChIJ5dMaWRMpQg0RXnhhz-6svLo,5,"Good place to have a drink with something to eat. With the drink they give you packet potatoes by default and with the second drink a skewer. It has a terrace with tables and the truth is that it is comfortable with a good neighborhood atmosphere and plenty of shade so it is cool, I was there at noon with the heat üòÖ. The service is great, the waitress is friendly and a machine serving the tables. I didn't go inside but the 1 star reviews don't put it very well. If you like my reviews or photos, follow me and don't miss the next ones, thank you very much for reading this far and I send you a big hug ü§óüòò"
ChIJ5dMaWRMpQg0RXnhhz-6svLo,5,"I recommend it 100%. The tapas are not only very generous but they are also delicious, and they are served right away. The place is impeccable, even the bathrooms are super clean. The waiters are charming. I plan to come very often!"
ChIJ7XeYFhQpQg0RcpRE2b7n4QE,5,"The restaurant offers great food and appears to be reasonably priced in comparison to other restaurants in the area. It is recommended to look up the menu and translate it before visiting to save time. Although the staff are friendly and willing to assist with the menu, their English proficiency is limited, so having good Spanish skills would be helpful."
ChIJ7XeYFhQpQg0RcpRE2b7n4QE,5,"The food served is great and there is a good variety of various types of foods. For international travellers there isn't an English menu, but the staff patient and working out what you want to eat is no hassle. The food is rich in flavour and definitely worth stopping by for. As always different people will have different experiences, this was only mine"
ChIJ7XeYFhQpQg0RcpRE2b7n4QE,5,Nice fries and beer. Good price.
ChIJ7XeYFhQpQg0RcpRE2b7n4QE,5,"Local tapas bar in Madrid,.found it walking around and it looked good and authentic so tried it and loved it for lunch. Went back again for dinner. Not fancy in the least but certainly authentic and tasty, the staff behind the bar are also friendly and attentive, they don't speak much English so try to know a bit of Spanish, and have the Jamon."
ChIJ7XeYFhQpQg0RcpRE2b7n4QE,3,Local bar and restaurant. Rapid service for menu del dia. Located not far from Madrid Chamartin Station. There is an outdoor seating area too.
ChIJS6rz-UomQg0R_IdUwyDvbk0,3,"A very mixed experience. The Tex Mex Nachos we had to start were excellent, but the meal went downhill from there. The Ox meat burger had been requested well done but was pretty much raw, and the portion of chicken in the chicken burger was tiny and overcooked. As we are not Spanish speakers trying to feed this back was impossible. A shame, the Nachos were really very good"
ChIJS6rz-UomQg0R_IdUwyDvbk0,1,"The meat is not bad but the cooking is needed to be improved!!  The environment is good tooooo. But the service is really not profesional: we have been waiting for the wine for more than half an hour till most of dishes were finished and the waiter even didn't say sorry and tried to explained that the process for serving the wine was right,  it should be served with the last dish or together with our dessert.   We also asked to take away the meat we haven't finished,  but they didn't give that to us.  incredible experience!"
ChIJS6rz-UomQg0R_IdUwyDvbk0,5,"Went by reccomendation of locals I met, it was exactly ‚Ç¨25/person but the quality of all the food is incredible. Tried steak and a burger and they were both the absolute best I have had outside of Texas."
ChIJS6rz-UomQg0R_IdUwyDvbk0,3,"Great place to eat a huge hamburguer. I've been there a few times and I had the feeling of waiting a eternity for the service but it's not as bad if you aren't terribly hungry. They have a big variety of meats and products you want into it, so you will be able to design the hamburguer of your dreams . It's not really noisy so you can breath out all your stress there."
ChIJS6rz-UomQg0R_IdUwyDvbk0,5,"Great place do have some tasty burgers. Would recommend to anyone, especially if you're thinking about going to McDonald's."
ChIJv6b-9hkpQg0R65ExHyAiURI,1,"Ordered today for the second time on Glovo, as I liked the food the first time.

Unfortunately, there was a piece of metallic wire inside my noodles. And to top it off, there was a huge fishbone in my maki."
ChIJv6b-9hkpQg0R65ExHyAiURI,4,Very nice little restaurant in Cuzco for a quick lunch. My friend and I were wanting to eat Pad Thai for weeks and this one didn‚Äôt disappointed! The flavor was amazing and the service was very fast! We were just sad that they didn‚Äôt have a menu del dia like most restaurants nearby.
ChIJv6b-9hkpQg0R65ExHyAiURI,5,"Excellent like always. We go every year for mo wife's Birthday and every year it's an amazing experience. The staff is super kind and helpful and the food is the best you will have. MUST TRY Korean tacos

See you next year!"
ChIJv6b-9hkpQg0R65ExHyAiURI,5,"Not a fan of Asian food at all, but waiter was really helpful, and food we chose was wonderful. Waiter really friendly, just the right amount of chat. Fantastic mojitos... definitely recommend the mojito, the only thing I wasn't sure of were the glass doors on the bathrooms, it didn't feel private enough."
ChIJv6b-9hkpQg0R65ExHyAiURI,4,"Went for lunch menu. Had the bento box, pretty good. Ingredients were fresh and presentation was appropriate.
Nice decor, friendly staffüëçüèΩ"
ChIJIwCTH34oQg0RIMVoUvO2tdw,4,Not bad place. Saw a great concert from Peter Hook and the Light. But 6 euros for a very slim beer was a shame. I didn't drink much. Good sound .
ChIJIwCTH34oQg0RIMVoUvO2tdw,1,"Traveled here all the way from Los Angeles to see KREAM. The vibe here was absolutely atrocious. Wannabe Vegas / Space Miami, TINY dancefloor that was overcrowded like crazy. Way too many sections for bottle service. Nowhere to dance, stand or even enjoy the music. Just a huge disappointment all around. Don‚Äôt waste your time."
ChIJIwCTH34oQg0RIMVoUvO2tdw,2,"$8/water is robbery!!! The worst part about this club is they have some great acts coming through! 65% of the venue is dominated by VIP tables and the dancefloor area proper is too small, in my opinion. Went for Ben Klock B2B Marcell Dettman. The sound was good, thank god! But I really was underwhelmed and much of the dancefloor wasn't dancing and then, of course, lots of random annoying moments of people using their full flash on the phone (BARF!), filming, etc. Not enough space to move around and really dance!!! Very sad and probably will be avoiding all events here in the future."
ChIJIwCTH34oQg0RIMVoUvO2tdw,2,"My two friends went up to the DJ booth area and asked me to join them. One of them grabbed my arm and pulled me up, the security guy sees this and violently with full force grabbed me arm and pulled me back, throwing me down the stairs. My drink flew all over the place and I banged my knee hard. Thankfully I was able to steady myself and didn‚Äôt break my ankle. This is a big beefy dude and I‚Äôm an average sized woman in heels. This guy should not be working anywhere near people and much less women. Did he really feel threatened enough by  woman  going up in heels that he had to resort to violence? Disgusting"
ChIJIwCTH34oQg0RIMVoUvO2tdw,1,Good line-up but next to that really bad. 3‚Ç¨ wardrobe for each piece!!! If you forget something in your jacket like your phone it costs the same price again to get it out! Incredible! The location is super commercial so nothing for techno lovers. They have more tables than space for dancing. Sad that the good djs go here.
ChIJWVKkLD4pQg0RNL74ekQc33s,5,"Since there‚Äôs no other option in this station I gave it a try despite the bad reviews, looks like they have a new manager or something because the salad I ordered has no issues and i could even hear the manager putting some order around, but if I were the owner I would just change the name and start anew"
ChIJWVKkLD4pQg0RNL74ekQc33s,4,"Good enough for the price and location (train station).
Is right next to a Burger King, and for me, that's no brainer.
Callitos a la madrile√±a was way better than the entrecot, so I recommend going for the local dishes.
Be aware that the kitchen closes at 16, then just coffee and sweets until 21."
ChIJWVKkLD4pQg0RNL74ekQc33s,1,2 Sandwiches from last year for 13.5‚Ç¨. The bread was so hard it could be used as a weapon. Also no toilets available. I just disappointed I couldn't give 0 stars.
ChIJWVKkLD4pQg0RNL74ekQc33s,1,"Dirty and expensive!
My glass was super dirty (I got Herpes only by looking at it), the Coke was warm and the tables where dirty as well. At least the staff seemed friendly."
ChIJWVKkLD4pQg0RNL74ekQc33s,3,Food was alright but nothing nice. Service seemed fine to me
ChIJD8DoFjopQg0RabJce_HxfNQ,5,"We stay in this hotel and on the day of our check out was blackout. It was my birthday and I want to say a big thank for the all team in hotel! Thanks for providing room, food! Thank you for hosting and humanity! In addition to that, we spent three nights in this hotel! It located close to the train station. It is good value for money! I highly recommend this hotel!"
ChIJD8DoFjopQg0RabJce_HxfNQ,5,"Beautiful hotel in a great location! Very dog friendly, it only costs ‚Ç¨10 a night extra and they provide you with a bed, a toy, two dog bowls, and treats! It's right by a local school so the location is lively, and as a single woman I felt very comfortable walking around by myself. There are kids everywhere and it feels like a lovely neighborhood. Also plenty of places to walk your dog! The cafe is quick and delicious and they do offer room service for a ‚Ç¨4 fee. The room is beautiful, exactly as pictured, the staff is helpful and excited, and the food is great. Overall, my dog loved staying here and so did I!"
ChIJD8DoFjopQg0RabJce_HxfNQ,5,"The staff was really kind and helpful, the dinner menu in their restaurant isn't extensive but it was delicious and you get continental breakfast too.
Not quite in the center but their is shops, restaurants, caf√©s, supermarkets, 10 pin bowlings roller discos and other things at walking distance from the hotel. Public transport available nearby: The bus stops are basically onthe front of the hotel and the metro station (Pio XII) is 5 min walk away (24 min away from city center by metro)"
ChIJD8DoFjopQg0RabJce_HxfNQ,1,"4 star hotel and no slippers? I don't think so!
Bus stop in front of the hotel and about 40 minutes ride until the city center. About 15 min walt until the metro station.
When they gave me the room the wc wasn't sanitized.
If i didn't pay in advance, i would not have stayed in this hotel. The rooms and common ares are outdated except the main lobby."
ChIJD8DoFjopQg0RabJce_HxfNQ,4,Kind staff and spacious rooms. The beds were comfortable but some details kept it from being 5 stars such as there being no bin in the room (only a small one in the bathroom)
ChIJBa9v0D8pQg0R-Y9JqlGPh0M,1,"We ordered 4 ""ca√±itas"" (beers) from the bar and one of them was half foam and half beer. I requested to the bartender to top it up and I received a horrible look and I was completely ignored. Very disappointed for the poor service. Not coming back to this branch."
ChIJBa9v0D8pQg0R-Y9JqlGPh0M,1,"The food was horrible. I was absolutely disgusted by it. It was prepackaged lasagna and I suspect it was heated in the microwave.
When I tried ordering some fries, I was told I can only order fries with the accompanying meat.
The only thing that was good was the fresh orange juice and the service. Although his English wasn't very good the waiter was very kind and polite.
do NOT recommend going here. They overcharge and I wouldn't even call it food."
ChIJBa9v0D8pQg0R-Y9JqlGPh0M,1,"This has to be the worst serviced bar/restaurant in Chamart√≠n. Our server brought the order incomplete, blatantly ignored us and made us wait for her to bring the bill. Eventually another waiter finally processed the payment. Food is bland and waaay overpriced."
ChIJBa9v0D8pQg0R-Y9JqlGPh0M,1,Horrible service and the beer was just foam. Get a bottle beer or go elsewhere
ChIJBa9v0D8pQg0R-Y9JqlGPh0M,1,Simply disgusting. Horrible frozen and overpriced omelet.
ChIJTRJiKj4pQg0RnNLA0tzS4Y0,3,"We came to celebrate new year‚Äôs eve. The dinner was good until they brought the steak, over cooked, they changed it 3 times and still were too cooked. The service was distracted at times.
Great atmosphere, very nice restaurant and small dance area, it was not over crowded.
Different kind of people, some families and groups of friends. Age group was around mid 30s for the majority.
We had the grapes sitting in our tables with a big screen."
ChIJTRJiKj4pQg0RnNLA0tzS4Y0,1,"While the people who received us were not the friendliest and most attentive, the place itself had a nice atmosphere. The food was absolutely outstanding, but the desserts, especially the pistachio cheesecake, fell a bit short. So, if you're planning to visit, go for the savory dishes and skip the dessert menu."
ChIJTRJiKj4pQg0RnNLA0tzS4Y0,4,"Conveniently located just outside Madrid Chamartin station. I was going for an early (18:30) dinner before catching a train. Most Spanish restaurants don't open until after 20:00 - this place was open but with a reduced card. Still with a good selection. I was the only customer so difficult to review the mood, but the staff was friendly, smiling, helpful with my luggage. The food was good but nothing extraordinary (not expecting that anyway). Nicely decorated with dark colours. A place worth a stop on your way"
ChIJTRJiKj4pQg0RnNLA0tzS4Y0,5,"Amazing place! Wide windows that let you enjoy your meal with Madrid's blue sky. Besides the good food, the restaurant is beautiful! We had a seafood pasta, baby squid and a tiramisu. Good service and prices are pretty reasonable with the quality they offer."
ChIJTRJiKj4pQg0RnNLA0tzS4Y0,4,"Complimentary olives were really tasty (only few left when taking pic). Homemade croquets were 4/5, I just had the da before really great ones with jamon and these were not as good. The burrata itself was good but unfortunately it came in a dome of smoke. This did not resemble wood smoke but a burnt barbeque :("
ChIJ4QOlKj4pQg0RO9ajufAKoOQ,4,"There was no soja milk, but at least the prices are the same than the ones in the city. The service may seem to be slower because it‚Äôs in the train station where everything is happening faster, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs slower than a usual Rodilla."
ChIJ4QOlKj4pQg0RO9ajufAKoOQ,1,"The sandwiches are pretty disgusting.  The ‚Äúbacon and brie‚Äù had a tiny bit of bacon and then a disgusting bunch of extremely processed meat.  The ‚ÄúCuban‚Äù sandwich was everything but, again, with a nasty processed meat.  To make matters worse, the restaurant is boiling and the trays just pile up with no where to put them.  Pretty awful experience."
ChIJ4QOlKj4pQg0RO9ajufAKoOQ,3,"My only problem is that it's really slow. This is because it's severly understaffed and not that the employee (singular) was slow by any means. Seems odd for a busy train station.

Food is as good as a typical Rodilla. Prices are approximately the same as in the city but sandwiches are sold as doubles. This is reasonable in my opinion."
ChIJ4QOlKj4pQg0RO9ajufAKoOQ,1,"They have a group of clocks on display.
Do not go by there clocks they are wrong."
ChIJ4QOlKj4pQg0RO9ajufAKoOQ,1,"Sadly only place open in a huge train station.

In a nutshell, abominable !!!. Frozen processed sandwich, watery undrinkable coffee. Can't understand places like this still can sell food. If nothing else is open, head to the vending machine and buy some m&ms ...

ufff can I rate 0.... discusting !!!"
ChIJx-brmDgpQg0RIL3Dtq0CebM,4,A really good salad bar! That's how I would describe it! The menus are of sandwiches and salads with the salads choice being the best of them! The juices are very good also! The value for money might be a bit high but nevertheless it's worth!
ChIJx-brmDgpQg0RIL3Dtq0CebM,5,"Good place to grab breakfast , muffins are very good.
The ginger lemonade is amazing and the selection of smoothies is very good
Also good place for lunch with the salads which you can choose base and toppings, veggie and vegan options
The place is nice and cozy
Usually not very crowded"
ChIJx-brmDgpQg0RIL3Dtq0CebM,5,"Great smoothies, good place for a quick lunch with great salads and an amazing place for a breakfast with their great smoothies and menus"
ChIJx-brmDgpQg0RIL3Dtq0CebM,3,"I see it closed most of the time, need to change the opening and closing time so the residences of the neighborhood can enjoy it also."
ChIJx-brmDgpQg0RIL3Dtq0CebM,2,They did not warn me they were closing 5 minutes before closing
ChIJ2_pHOWspQg0Rg2lPy3J5RSg,4,"Good pasta and pizza
Salad was poor"
ChIJ2_pHOWspQg0Rg2lPy3J5RSg,5,"Would recommend 100% The food is delicious! The service was great (be mindful of what good service is considered in Spain, do not expect the server to check on you or the food unless you request it). Very friendly staff, delicious food, and great ambiance make it deserving of 5 stars! Would definitely come back!"
ChIJ2_pHOWspQg0Rg2lPy3J5RSg,4,"Everything was very delicious! We were 6 people and although we had a reservation, there was not many people in it, enough to be comfortable. I quite liked the Calzone and the Pan de Ajo. Definitely will go back someday!"
ChIJ2_pHOWspQg0Rg2lPy3J5RSg,5,First time that I found everything I like in just one pasta plate!! Omg it was sooo delicious! I really recommend the MEZZELUNE ALLA CARBONARA if you are a carbonara lover like me! The sparkling sangria was ok-ish. But I would say that in general I think that in terms of price-quality this place is quite good!
ChIJ2_pHOWspQg0Rg2lPy3J5RSg,1,Me and a group of friends who came on a business trip wanted to try something ‚Äúitalian‚Äù but it had nothing to do with the authentic italian cuisine. You can find lots of other delicious italian dishes if you come to Romania üòÖ
ChIJxyrVpRUpQg0RErpmYDtExTo,4,"I ordered mixed Paella. The food was good. But, I was disappointed that they don't serve this traditional dish for one person. So, I had to spent double money. I want to request the restaurant authority to   available the rice items for single person also. Otherwise,  the ambience, behaviour of the staffs are good. I asked them to pack the leftover food. They packed it in a air-tied box which is praise worthy. If you want to have your lunch or dinner near Chamartin Station you can go there."
ChIJxyrVpRUpQg0RErpmYDtExTo,5,"Croquettes, fried pork belly, fried calamari were my recommendations from owner.
I am not taking three fried- switched to grilled squid (13euros). Tastes like cuttlefish.
Croquette nice. The spanish are good at it.
Fried pork belly. Cooked perfectly, fried and cut similar to chinese styles. Obv all fat.
Grilled squid. ABSOLUTE perfection. Pork belly was a textbook example but check this out. IMMACULATE temperature control. Cooks worldwide, watch and learn.
Texture couldnt be better.
Grilled squid took a while, this must be why.
Always ask a local which restaurant to go and then ask the owner or waiter what they recommend. Most of them, but not all, are the gems."
ChIJxyrVpRUpQg0RErpmYDtExTo,5,The Gambas al Ajillo were mouth watering and the Iberian Ham had a distinct taste. The wine collection is great and the location is great to enjoy some nice views across the street. A must visit for anyone.
ChIJxyrVpRUpQg0RErpmYDtExTo,3,Daily menu 13‚Ç¨. A bit expensive but you gotta consider that this area is full of tourist... Acceptable place taking all into account. Do not expect something outstanding. Just OK.
ChIJxyrVpRUpQg0RErpmYDtExTo,3,"Food was great quality and taste but, I fell in to a tourist trap. I ordered the broken eggs. I think 7 euro dish. The waiter pulled the fast one and said its better with ham! You want?... ofc i want it better. So ham is 10 euros more. I wasn't expecting to pay almost 20 euros for some eggs and potatos but well played sir. Just be aware of adding ham!"
ChIJ__KKVxMpQg0RTwNxxUiYFZg,4,Nice restaurante with lovely food. Very good quality price. Highly recommended we enjoy our lunch
ChIJ__KKVxMpQg0RTwNxxUiYFZg,2,"Expensive for what it gives
Food was average for its cost
Chicken came raw
Churrasco was so hard to eat
Pasta was over cooked"
ChIJ__KKVxMpQg0RTwNxxUiYFZg,1,"Without a doubt, the worst bar/restaurant in this area. Don't go for the menu of the day (menu del d√≠a)! It's expensive in comparison with others around, and food is not specially cooked or prepared. They usually put french fries with any type of food. Service is average. Not a place for me."
ChIJ__KKVxMpQg0RTwNxxUiYFZg,4,Might look rusty from the outside but here you'll find the most friendly staff ever. We go here often for an afterhours and don't stop having great time. Prices are more than reasonable
ChIJ__KKVxMpQg0RTwNxxUiYFZg,4,"Good tortilla, middling tapas, great service, cold drinks."
ChIJx1StkDgpQg0RyeMK-sv8bj0,3,"The restaurant was clean and comfortable. The French toasts are very good and that why we ordered cheesecake too. But unfortunately was it not so good, in the Middle was it still frozen and on the edges medium warm. Additionally we waited a very long time for the cheesecake. The waitresses were friendly but it took way too much time."
ChIJx1StkDgpQg0RyeMK-sv8bj0,5,Great service thanks to Alex‚Äôs exquisite attention and great food and atmosphere
ChIJx1StkDgpQg0RyeMK-sv8bj0,4,"4.0 because there is no 4.9:))))
I liked the food very much, A little bit more then I was expecting costed one Burger - 15‚Ç¨
But steal was very tasty.
Also a nice Service."
ChIJx1StkDgpQg0RyeMK-sv8bj0,4,"What's good :  the place is nice, comfortable seats, that's always a nice thing. The attention was quick and the guy was polite.
What's ok :  the food. It was OK, maybe from the range from OK to good.
What's not so good : prices. A little bit pricey."
ChIJx1StkDgpQg0RyeMK-sv8bj0,5,Great menu Del dia with a good variety! Also Clarissa the waitress is very great and accommodating :)
ChIJn-IUPBgpQg0RuWLpr1KCsqM,5,"Very good food.  Nice services.  Best place for young people. Always you can see a crowd inside the hotel.  Very good design.  If you are going with a group,  better to reserve early."
ChIJn-IUPBgpQg0RuWLpr1KCsqM,4,"Typical, online, no surprises."
ChIJn-IUPBgpQg0RuWLpr1KCsqM,5,"A decent American style burger bar, also serving pasta, Mexican dishes and salads. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Burgers were tasty, cooked exactly to order and service was quick. Nice atmosphere too. Thanks."
ChIJn-IUPBgpQg0RuWLpr1KCsqM,5,"Love this place, best burgers in the neighborhood"
ChIJn-IUPBgpQg0RuWLpr1KCsqM,5,Juan carlos was so nice. He is very approachable and very hospitable. Thank you.
ChIJy215hDgpQg0RhDRNM7_V0Uo,5,"I had a daily menu here, which costs 14 euro. Food was good. Service is good too. I can recommend this place for a fast lunch."
ChIJy215hDgpQg0RhDRNM7_V0Uo,5,"I discovered the restaurant by the fork and we ate very well! It shows that they work with a genre and with quality. We ordered scallops with mango sauce, artichoke, croquettes and meat.
You can't put any buts.
On the other hand, the service was very good.
The only drawback I would say is that the place was cold."
ChIJy215hDgpQg0RhDRNM7_V0Uo,5,"An excellent experience from start to finish. The food at Dolan is simply spectacular: the rice is one of the best I have ever had, the starters are very well prepared and the desserts are exquisite. The staff's attention was impeccable and the atmosphere of the place was very pleasant. In addition, they have a good list of wines and drinks to accompany the food. Without a doubt, a highly recommended site. I'll be back soon."
ChIJy215hDgpQg0RhDRNM7_V0Uo,4,"Good place a little hidden but quiet, spacious and
accessible, original food (e.g. chicken cachopo) and good service, you can tell that
It is a place that lives off the ""Menu"" for its efficiency and speed
...I'm interested in knowing if the letter improves or maintains the
quality. We will return..."
ChIJy215hDgpQg0RhDRNM7_V0Uo,5,"Very good place, we ate rice with shrimp and red meat 350g, two desserts and drank. We caught it on the fork with a 20% discount. Everything was very nice and so were the waiters."
ChIJD099fRQpQg0RAkLp2yCxiaI,5,"If you are in Madrid and looking for good food, good atmosphere, and non-tourist environment, have lunch here. The food is excellent (no matter what you eat) and there is something for everyone! Great wine list, too. You can‚Äôt go wrong."
ChIJD099fRQpQg0RAkLp2yCxiaI,5,Superb service and the food was delicious.  Lisa and Ruth were on it. Lisa the ma√Ætre d‚Äô is a force of nature- she had an eagle eye on everything. Luis gave us a complimentary after dinner drink and they were very tasty. Highly recommend this beautiful restaurant. The empanada de bacalao was sublime. Best service we had in Spain.
ChIJD099fRQpQg0RAkLp2yCxiaI,5,"We were greeted by Ruth and Lisa and they were wonderful! Super attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. They made a wonderful recommendation of the Seabass and it was exquisite! We followed that up with a rice pudding that was out of this world! The atmosphere was sparkling and private. Overall, it was an outstanding gastronomic experience."
ChIJD099fRQpQg0RAkLp2yCxiaI,4,"The waiters were warm and hospitable and most could speak English. You can tell that the two older gentleman have been doing this for a long time.

I have written my critique below the photos of the meals. Overall great flavours, just some minor dislikes in our opinion.  For what you pay : (in our case 91.90 euro excluding alcohol) I think it is a little on the pricey side compared to other meals I have had in Madrid.

Still worth a visit! I‚Äôm sure you will enjoy !"
ChIJD099fRQpQg0RAkLp2yCxiaI,5,"Amazing
quality of food, both fish and meat, in this very charming restaurant. I happened to d√Æne early january, in a very quiet period, so the atmosphere was very quiet. Yet, I would highly recommend the place. Camilo and Paco, thank you for your beautiful service !"
ChIJuShnLRgpQg0RlykfFHj5QEk,5,"Wife and I went 2 days in a row, great food and prices

The lasagna and spaghetti pasta seems to be fresh, loved the olive oil with Cayenne pepper.

Also, the 1L lemonade is refreshing, really worths the price

I don't speak much Spanish but the staff helped me and that was great."
ChIJuShnLRgpQg0RlykfFHj5QEk,4,"Good location, good quality, delicious, cozy.
Recommend"
ChIJuShnLRgpQg0RlykfFHj5QEk,3,"I ordered something chili spicy, but it wasn't at all, I guess they forgot it. I told them and they brought some oil with paprika, but that was a bit weird.
Staff was very friendly, but the place was crowded, so the food took a while. I think there was only one chef.
Place/atmosphere was nice."
ChIJuShnLRgpQg0RlykfFHj5QEk,5,Good food and great service!
ChIJuShnLRgpQg0RlykfFHj5QEk,2,"An absolute disaster, from ordering to receiving the last meal, took  two hours. Dishes came out one at a time, some coming out cold. No apologies or compensation of the bill"
ChIJHbNfQRopQg0R8AVpJ0z-muQ,5,Thanks again. Great food & very nice service!
ChIJHbNfQRopQg0R8AVpJ0z-muQ,1,"I went for a milkshake and waited 20 minutes to be sat down on a table. The milkshake was good but the service was the slowest I have ever experienced. This is due to the owners not hiring enough people. There were 20 or more tables and only 3 staff members one of them was a manager, one a bar man and one a waiter. Unbelievable I wouldn't recommend it, unless you were desperate."
ChIJHbNfQRopQg0R8AVpJ0z-muQ,4,"It was the closest place to my hotel so went there while jetlagged. Ordered a Cubano which was fine but not amazing, the Fritas came with it were superb. Beer was delicious and came quickly when ordered. Better than I expected if you're staying nearby."
ChIJHbNfQRopQg0R8AVpJ0z-muQ,5,Updated the score giving more start for the service. I really like the breakfast here
ChIJHbNfQRopQg0R8AVpJ0z-muQ,4,"One of the best vips that I had visited, good food with an incredible staff. I always order a Waikiki salad, 100% recommended."
ChIJb-CiVWspQg0R6LMJ5oqsxKo,5,"Good food and great service.
Good variety of options. We went with the family and really enjoyed it"
ChIJb-CiVWspQg0R6LMJ5oqsxKo,1,"Probably the worst dining experience I've had in Madrid in my 7 years here - do not go here.

When I arrive and I went to sit in my seat, I stepped on a piece of potato or pasta and it was stuck to my shoe, so removing that was no fun. The placemats were slight broken and the chairs were coming apart. They need to do a little upkeep. It was way too dark where we were sitting, we needed our flashlights to read the menu.

I didn't know what to order so I looked around the room and saw pizzas on other people's tables and the pizzas looked mediocre...I gave it a shot because I usually don't order pasta at restaurants and honestly - I've had pizza from Aldi that was WAY better.

The crust was undercooked and it had no flavour and it looked like something you'd feed to a child that doesn't know the difference.

My friends ordered their various pastas and all of them said it was mediocre at best. There was a huge lack of flavour and no salt...that's the bare minimum. Another didn't have enough sauce and another said her dish arrived cold.

We all ate our food because it was late and we were starving.

The waiter was also extremely rude from the start and I think he had a rough night - probably because the kitchen kept sending out horrible food, and the waiter was the first to face the fire...although he was just rude before he got our food.

I can't imagine this place surviving past 2024."
ChIJb-CiVWspQg0R6LMJ5oqsxKo,5,"Good restaurant. Delicious food, good service. Friendly staff and flexible when you have no reservation. Really great proof of family restaurants' LaMafia chain. Love it!"
ChIJb-CiVWspQg0R6LMJ5oqsxKo,4,"Very nice food, friendly service!"
ChIJb-CiVWspQg0R6LMJ5oqsxKo,2,"Steaks are horrible - ordered medium - got even not English. Don't order steaks here.

Pizza is okay not more. Didn't test the Pasta
Next time I will go to restaurant next door.slow service, the woman in service is good. The man is just a fail."
ChIJF2DTWBMpQg0RgxZ5W0GP2g8,3,"I entered just because it has wide windows and said ""special coffees"". The atmosphere inside is of cozy coffee houses, even if it's a salad bar. Nice produce, fruit juices, and the so-called special coffees aren't the big thing here - or they don't explore it. Soy coffee very well tendered, impecable service and excellent low/smooth music playing on. Won't increase the rating just because I haven't eaten anything, but definitely worth going for soy latte :)"
ChIJF2DTWBMpQg0RgxZ5W0GP2g8,5,Love it here healthy and tasty food in a cozy place. The coffee is also great!
ChIJF2DTWBMpQg0RgxZ5W0GP2g8,4,One of the better salad places around the four towers area. Price has gone up in the past month or so which is a shame.
ChIJF2DTWBMpQg0RgxZ5W0GP2g8,1,Had a sandwich could not do a foot long for some reason the staff wanted to get me out  of there. But I found this in my sandwich nearly broke my tooth  you were open so no need to lie.   just be honest
ChIJF2DTWBMpQg0RgxZ5W0GP2g8,5,The food was very good and fresh!! And what iv liked about this place is that you cand make your own salad and they ar very kind!!!
ChIJo9HmcDwpQg0Rdip4HEy7yDU,5,"Staff were very friendly, food was and delicious. Fresh pastries were also delicious. Be careful if you come at 1030-1100, the place flooded with school students and was complete chaos for about 30 minutes. The staff were quick to clean up after they all left."
ChIJo9HmcDwpQg0Rdip4HEy7yDU,3,Menu 10.5
ChIJo9HmcDwpQg0Rdip4HEy7yDU,5,"A classic battle bar, it has the 3Bs. Good and fast service. Great variety in breakfast and daily menu."
ChIJo9HmcDwpQg0Rdip4HEy7yDU,5,"They served me quickly, the place is ideal for those who come from outside Madrid and arrive early... If you leave Duque de Pastrana station two minutes away, you will have this cafeteria, which opens at 6am, which is why it gets the 5 stars.  You can pay by card."
ChIJo9HmcDwpQg0Rdip4HEy7yDU,5,"Excellent places for breakfast, it has a wide variety of savory and sweet dishes, highlighting the tomato and ham toast. It's very good. The service is very good and the quality-price is unbeatable. If I return to Madrid I will surely repeat"
ChIJO68ooz0pQg0RUUWg8ju8I-g,4,"Delightful ambience and staff. The food and wine were mostly very good although we paid ‚Ç¨108 for two which is, IMHO,  a bit pricey. We also had some prawns to share. Rather than enhancing the flavour the sauce was not to our tastes!"
ChIJO68ooz0pQg0RUUWg8ju8I-g,5,An amazing find. Beautiful restaurant with great service. Quite a wide selection of seafood and meats. Cuisine is modern Spanish. We were welcome graciously. Staff was very accommodating even though we didn't speak Spanish and some of us had dietary restrictions. Definitely worth a visit. Fine dining at a reasonable price.
ChIJO68ooz0pQg0RUUWg8ju8I-g,5,Very tasty restaurant. Plus hospitality was perfect. Friendly and the food was provided in due time. Absolutely recommend to spend some nice time with your friends or co worker.
ChIJO68ooz0pQg0RUUWg8ju8I-g,5,Absolutely brilliant. Exquisite food. Personable service and great value for what you get. Fantastic variety and I will definitely repeat.
ChIJO68ooz0pQg0RUUWg8ju8I-g,5,"Such a luck to find a good restaraunt in our residential area. The food is great, the service is very attentive, highly recommend"
ChIJA3SbGQApQg0Rs4VGX21c13Y,4,"I tell you one thing, the biggest surprise I have ever had in a burger, they are simple without complications, but they are delicious. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, it is above the station and is an attractive burger. go if you can"
ChIJA3SbGQApQg0Rs4VGX21c13Y,5,"‚Ç¨12 for a menu, next to the station I see it well, the burger is delicious, the frozen potatoes"
ChIJA3SbGQApQg0Rs4VGX21c13Y,5,"We came looking for a place to eat since we were catching the bird in a few hours, very friendly service, great food, and while we watched people skate!!"
ChIJA3SbGQApQg0Rs4VGX21c13Y,5,"We had a wonderful dinner, the burger was delicious and served quickly, and the atmosphere was very good."
ChIJA3SbGQApQg0Rs4VGX21c13Y,4,I grabbed a burger and fries to go. Delicious and very good quantity
ChIJ53iqzz8pQg0RS5nhBqQ5jYQ,5,"So much fun! Have been twice and will definitely go back. The food is great & you can request your favourite songs while skating. Definitely recommend the combo they do on Thursday that includes entrance, skates and dinner."
ChIJ53iqzz8pQg0RS5nhBqQ5jYQ,4,"Great place for roller blading or inline skating. Good mainstream music and atmosphere. Their chocolate milkshake was delicious but a bit overpriced at 8‚Ç¨. The only drawback was the amount of children who skate all over the place and are easily run over.

Plus: Location is right next to the Metro Station and has multiple other activities (Bowling, Billard, ) nearby"
ChIJ53iqzz8pQg0RS5nhBqQ5jYQ,4,"Fun atmosphere to hang out with your partner or your friends, sometimes there could be a lot of kids who get really noisy, but it‚Äôs not that bothering.
Food is not the best, but I only tried the fried things like fired chicken, mozarella jalape√±os bullets, French fries, etc.
The other stuff like sandwiches, look really good but I haven‚Äôt tried them so far.
Overall I rate the experience a 4/5 because of the food mostly, but if you only go to have fun skating it would be a 5/5."
ChIJ53iqzz8pQg0RS5nhBqQ5jYQ,5,"This is an amazing place to have a great time skating and dancing with friends and even to have a date in, and you can even ask the Dj for songs and they will play them. It is located in the train station of Chamart√≠n-Clara Campoamor, and it is kinda hard to find the first time you go there, but I always have an amazing time there. The price is 15‚Ç¨ for entrance (you can stay however long you want) and 3‚Ç¨ for skate renting (you can bring your own roller skates and protections if you want). On Saturdays from 9 pm they have an only adults night, and they also have some offers and stuff on their website. There is a restaurant there, but it is kinda expensive. You can buy in the web a ticket with the entrance + a meal for much cheaper than buying them separately. Overall, it is a very nice place to have a wonderful night out doing some sport while having fun."
ChIJ53iqzz8pQg0RS5nhBqQ5jYQ,2,"We only asked that you change from one of your playlists to another one of yours, not ours. For you to say that we put our requests ahead of others is not true. My husband asked first if anyone had requested the playlist that you were playing and the response was no, that it was music that the owner wanted played. My comment about the floor being in bad condition, I understand that you have construction happening around you that can affect the floor but it needs repair. There are no referees keeping the floor in order. What I mean by that is, there were children lying on the floor and adults, carrying their food trays across the floor and none of the employees corrected them. This creates chaos and makes the floor dangerous. The acoustics could be improved, it sounds like two songs are playing at one time. Your business has potential and that is the reason why I‚Äôm making these comments, not to criticize you, but just like with everyone, everyone can improve. With the music, everything that I‚Äôve seen from you on Instagram says you have a DJ. Now I understand that is only for parties. I would correct that on your social media so people don‚Äôt have a different expectation. I would recommend to anyone wanting to request music to bring your headphones to not have to bother the staff. I see this place as being the perfect location for a photo opportunity for someone to go and then share on their Instagram page one time. For us rollerskating is more than that. Roller skating is one of the greatest pleasures that I know. It is how I met my husband 36 years ago. Every good thing that I have all started with roller skating and that is the passion that I‚Äôm talking about. I wish you well"
ChIJddtQPDkpQg0RipCUosFlXdE,5,"Great, humble food - a fantastic alternativ to the establishments at Chamartin. Had amazing chickpea stew and ""bacalao"", salted cod. Amazing taste, simple, yet elegant approch to cooking. Will definately go again!"
ChIJddtQPDkpQg0RipCUosFlXdE,5,"Wonderful family-owned restaurant since over 30 years. Alejandro and his family are the most hospitable people you could ever think of! We arrived when the kitchen was closed, but Alejandro worked his magic and made sure we didn‚Äôt need to leave hungry.

Two days later we came for the amazing 13‚Ç¨ lunch menu incl. starter, main, dessert and drink. The food was absolutely fabulous. As mains we had the cod fish and fresh sausages and both were really good.

On top of all, knowing that we were new in the city and looking for an apartment, Alejandro gave us his number and patiently answered all our questions on WhatsApp.

Make sure you go to this place. Food is amazing and the welcoming and warm atmosphere by Alejandro, his Mum and brother is unrivaled!

Thanks Alejandro & family, we look forward to seeing you again once we found a place in Madrid!"
ChIJddtQPDkpQg0RipCUosFlXdE,5,"This place is amazing. The ‚Äúpincho de tortilla‚Äù is a must. Quality and service are over the top. I spent 2 hours by the bar drinking coffee and eating, this place is just the place to be if you‚Äôre near the station."
ChIJddtQPDkpQg0RipCUosFlXdE,5,Fresh delicious food and very kind service!
ChIJddtQPDkpQg0RipCUosFlXdE,5,"Nice, quiet place with great tortilla de patata. Amazing customer service."
ChIJcdiiMD4pQg0RFzXf7RN6eNA,5,Have been to Restaurante Navelgas many times.First time to provide a Review.A busy restaurant outside Charmartin train station. It is a typical no frills local bar with great selection of tapas. The large pincho de tortilla is one of the best in Madrid. Would recommend for all.
ChIJcdiiMD4pQg0RFzXf7RN6eNA,5,"friendly service. ‚Ç¨12 for a generous hamburger (big meat patty with melted cheese, 2 rashers bacon, salad and friend potatoes- beats Burger King opposite hands down!) and small beer. not gourmet but good for a train station."
ChIJcdiiMD4pQg0RFzXf7RN6eNA,1,"The waiter was very nice. But to pay 3.60‚Ç¨ for a pincho tortilla like this, that‚Äôs a robbery"
ChIJcdiiMD4pQg0RFzXf7RN6eNA,3,It's  in a train station and feels like it.
ChIJcdiiMD4pQg0RFzXf7RN6eNA,2,Ok it's a railway station restaurant. Don't expect too much. Beers were beer and the food for 14 euro was terrible. Dry unseasoned escalope and fries. You really need to be stuck for a place to eat.
ChIJoYQKLxEpQg0RB6QwdT4gLak,5,Isabel was fantastic and very patient in taking my order. She helped me thoroughly even tho I don‚Äôt speak any Spanish. Thanks Isabel.
ChIJoYQKLxEpQg0RB6QwdT4gLak,1,"Its a normal burger king but with just one cashier which mean you must alwayswait for a bout 10-15 minutes to order and the machines are not working
I read another guy review which said the situation was like this since 9 months ago but i know that it was like this since early 2020
Hope they fix it .üòí"
ChIJoYQKLxEpQg0RB6QwdT4gLak,5,I thought the burgers were great. The staff were nice as well. I was hesitant after seeing all the bad reviews but overall it was as good as any other burger kings.
ChIJoYQKLxEpQg0RB6QwdT4gLak,1,Take to long so my friece where cold and claim them to get New one. Burger the chease Was not ready to go and to much souce
ChIJoYQKLxEpQg0RB6QwdT4gLak,1,"If Hades had a a portal on Earth and it was a fast food restaurant, this would be it. Nothing good happens here. Staff is rude, customers are clueless and the ""food"" is barely edible. Avoid."
ChIJOwFEg8spQg0R-0kQdnce790,1,"We had a great experience at the lobby bar on our arrival day. However, the next day, when we ordered room service, the behavior of the employees could not be more disastrous. They got the order wrong, and when we called no one asked what the problem was and simply said they would cook everything again. We waited, and they came back with the sandwich that was initially correct. We explained it to the lady who delivered the order, who said she could not understand and would send her boss to talk to us. Five minutes later, a blond lady came to our room complaining we were the ones wrong. She raised her tone at my partner, pointing at her tablet saying we ordered something we didn't. I showed my phone with the correct order, and she raised her voice saying ‚ÄúNo, this is what you ordered!‚Äù tapping her device again. The behavior this second lady showed was simply unacceptable, especially considering this is catering to a 5-star hotel. Even if we were wrong, that‚Äôs not how you treat customers.

Later on, her manager called acknowledging there was indeed a problem in the system and that they got our order wrong. In the end, my partner and I had dinner at different times (one hour apart to be more precise), and the restaurant didn't have the courtesy to offer us this dinner after such a mess (they did send an extra portion of salad?).

Such a minor issue with a simple solution turned into a disproportional argument and spoiled our evening and the nice impression we had from the night before."
ChIJOwFEg8spQg0R-0kQdnce790,5,"Loved the hotel! Good location, very comfortable, best service, beautiful and clean, definitely recommend to my friends"
ChIJOwFEg8spQg0R-0kQdnce790,5,"Pleasantly surprised !!! Excellent service, great atmosphere. One of the best toasted / melt club sandwiches I ever had, the Caesar salad is served with fried chicken strips (my favorite way to salad) and prosciutto which was a nice touch."
ChIJOwFEg8spQg0R-0kQdnce790,5,"Very friendly staff, very well decorated place on the ground floor of the hotel, it has a very cool interior terrace, I had been several times, if you go with the fork discount it is a great price"
ChIJOwFEg8spQg0R-0kQdnce790,5,"Original decoration, very nice staff. Quiet and careful environment. Quality food. The Burrata, the vegetables and the spectacular octopus. We will repeat without a doubt."
ChIJ-UZD_E-jpBIRT3FgyW08Aao,5,"The Stage Bar on the roof of the Hotel Occidental is a delight.

If you come before 9pm, wear your swimsuit so you can cocktail from the pool.

The vibe is energetic yet romantic with a mix of Spanish-speaking couples and boisterous Brits.

The music is lively but not overpowering (this is a fine hotel bar, not a nightclub)

The views are nice, higher than most of the surroundings, so the breeze is really ‚Äúthe thing.‚Äù  Carolina, the cheerful bartender from Ecuador, made me the best Mojito ever."
ChIJ-UZD_E-jpBIRT3FgyW08Aao,2,"For 12 euros per drink, I would expect my own butler and at least no brain concussion while getting up from the couch(due to diagonal pillars placed right above you). There is no good view because most likely another hotel or skyscraper is being built right in front of this hotel, so that will be an interesting view(right now, it is the construction machines). So yeah. In total, including some mandatory tips/fees, for three drinks(two mojitos and a beer), it ended up being 31 euros. Check the menu before you order anything"
ChIJ-UZD_E-jpBIRT3FgyW08Aao,1,Really small and was absolutely not looking inviting. Unorganized and no stuff visible. With that impression we decided to leave directly.
ChIJ-UZD_E-jpBIRT3FgyW08Aao,1,"It seems a little outrageous to me to go to a 4-star (luxury) hotel, so that the service ignores you all afternoon, they don't come to ask you for orders even if you notify them 3 times and on top of that they bring you the dataphone for every cocktail you order. This is up to one's taste but all the glasses are plastic. Irrational price for what the cocktail is and for the tapas, don't ask us for anything because the bravas literally come with 8 units of mini potatoes.
In the end,
Thanks for the experience."
ChIJ-UZD_E-jpBIRT3FgyW08Aao,1,"Unfortunately we walked to go to this place and the rooftop is not worth it at all. The waiters treated us very poorly, they were late, they pretended not to see when we called. We ordered bread because they brought us a hummus with only strips of bell pepper and it took half an hour and on top of that they charged us for it as if it were bread with tomato and it was hard bread, a horror. They shouldn't have the location on Google Maps if they can't keep a rooftop well attended."
ChIJ3bSPu_opQg0RIrb2a9tEV6Q,3,Not bad burger. A little over priced for the quality
ChIJ3bSPu_opQg0RIrb2a9tEV6Q,5,
ChIJI8na3xopQg0RjfoQc8Fw7es,4,"Menu of the day for 19 euros, with the option of a half menu for 12. Includes bread, drink and dessert. The food is quite good and quite prepared, although I think the price could be adjusted more. Parking is bad in the area."
ChIJI8na3xopQg0RjfoQc8Fw7es,5,"Very varied breakfast, by the way it is open on Saturdays and Sundays"
ChIJI8na3xopQg0RjfoQc8Fw7es,5,Ilunion P√≠o XII hotel restaurant. Very rich. Good service. A great and abundant breakfast. It was worth staying at this hotel.
ChIJI8na3xopQg0RjfoQc8Fw7es,4,Advisable
ChIJW4tFJDMpQg0R7xqUZfy7Kjo,5,"Shabbos dinner was great! Your food was excellent - thank you üôèüèª We ordered chicken shnitzel and meat balls , diff√©rents salads and hallot ! They do delivery as well !"
ChIJW4tFJDMpQg0R7xqUZfy7Kjo,5,"Gourmet Kosher provided Kosher food for my colleague during our company trip in Madrid. They were responsive when communicating via email and via phone, on time with deliveries, and great food quality. We were left happy with the services provided."
ChIJW4tFJDMpQg0R7xqUZfy7Kjo,5,"Wow, this place is such a help.
Stopped on the way to the train station. Where we were traveling has zero kosher.
We got everything we needed to hold us over...
Also is you are interested in kosher pate, they have an amazing goose liver+goose for under 10 Euro."
ChIJW4tFJDMpQg0R7xqUZfy7Kjo,5,Enjoyed our visit today. Friendly and helpful staff.
ChIJW4tFJDMpQg0R7xqUZfy7Kjo,5,Incredible supermarket where you can get a variety of kosher products at a good price and a good grilled chicken.
ChIJGRIjckgpQg0RWVc5CLFOu60,5,"The best burger in my life so quick and tasty, very friendly and helpful stuff I will back here again!"
ChIJGRIjckgpQg0RWVc5CLFOu60,5,Very good service and good food. We ordered a pastri sandwich and a sandwich cubano. It was very delicious and it came very fast. I would recommend it to everyone!!
ChIJGRIjckgpQg0RWVc5CLFOu60,5,Excellent service by Jalil
ChIJGRIjckgpQg0RWVc5CLFOu60,5,"LUISA had a good service with us, thank you for everything,  super fast and friendly, i highly recommend this place"

ChIJb5CVSDMpQg0RJ0-u3M-xF3g,4,"This is a very nice place to enjoy a home made meals without paying a lot. They offer daily menus with a starter, main dish, dessert or cofee and one drink of your choice. We had the salad and the gazpacho, roasted chiken, and cheeks. Coffee and roasted apple. Nice all of them. The service is very kind, and the environment is quite familiar and traditional."
ChIJb5CVSDMpQg0RJ0-u3M-xF3g,5,"Nice service, delicious grilled fish, yummy dessert, treats for kid, kind neighbours, thanks"

ChIJnb0KqkkpQg0RTo88STeSbTQ,5,"The duck dumpling is the way to go. Very deliciously made.

Also you can never go wrong with noodles üçú

Over all very good quality food."
ChIJnb0KqkkpQg0RTo88STeSbTQ,1,"It was not a very good experience, the food quality is less than average and the starters were delicious but cold..
The problem was with the second dish of the menu ""daditos de pollo al curry picante"" it had nothing to do with the name, has no daditos no curry no picante no presentation (check the photo below) and I gave it back and they still charged for it.
The noodls were oily ...
Won't recommend."
ChIJnb0KqkkpQg0RTo88STeSbTQ,5,"Restaurant in the Pinar de Chamartin area. The street it's on it a bit strange, almost circular. If you take the metro, be sure to use maps to get it. Parking seems scarce, but we didn't take a car... The restaurant itself is an Asian fusion with very tasty food. We absolutely loved the shrimp in papillote with ginger aroma. It was recommended to us by our waiter and I have to say I'm glad we took his advice. Pricing was OK, we had Tums from the fork to use, so we had a discount. They did have interesting ""menu"" prices (prix fix). There is a very large terrace area that is quite nice and the inside is also large. Even so, reservations are definitely necessary as it gets quite busy.  We will return for sure."
ChIJnb0KqkkpQg0RTo88STeSbTQ,5,Nice environmentÔºå good service and delicious food Ôºå one of best Chinese restaurant in Madrid
ChIJnb0KqkkpQg0RTo88STeSbTQ,5,"Excellent food, outstanding service! Can only recommend!"
ChIJmyNno0kpQg0RjjVg4kA0v28,5,"What an amazing place. Staff were amazingly friendly and accommodating. We arrived as a family of four hoping to watch the Real Madrid v Arsenal match. Despite being clearly full, they moved everything around to fit us in. We felt so welcome and at ease. Highly recommend visiting if ever in the area. Thank you so much."
ChIJmyNno0kpQg0RjjVg4kA0v28,5,Best night as an arsenal fan in Madrid - thought 2006 and was peak. This topped it- amazing atmosphere- great hosts !!
ChIJmyNno0kpQg0RjjVg4kA0v28,5,"The service here is wonderful! Although not all staff speak English (not expected) they tried their best to make us comfortable and helped with sports game (partner wanted to watch)
The tablet jamon and tortilla were amazing! I would highly recommend for a place for sport and food :)"
ChIJmyNno0kpQg0RjjVg4kA0v28,5,"Very friendly and welcoming staff, when myself and my 13 yr old son came to watch the Real Madrid Supercup match. Thank you! Great atmosphere and good choice of beers and plenty of TV screens. If ever we are in Madrid again we will come back."
ChIJmyNno0kpQg0RjjVg4kA0v28,5,"We were with a big group of people, the host was friendly and funny, the atmosphere is nice and cozy, Tinto de verano and snacks was very delicious :))"
ChIJx2bcv-UpQg0RuwTkoxpad7s,4,Large premises in the executive area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMadrid. The arepas have good flavor for 5 euros. Ricoo orange juice
ChIJx2bcv-UpQg0RuwTkoxpad7s,2,"A wonderful, spacious place with simple but elegant decoration.
The waitress Mar√≠a Jos√© is charming and takes great care of you, however the manager always seems to be in a bad mood, with bad gestures and will charge you if she could even to breathe.
It's a shame because with this attitude you lose the desire to drink coffee in a calm and relaxed way."
ChIJx2bcv-UpQg0RuwTkoxpad7s,2,"The food is delicious, but they take a long time to serve. They take note of the entire menu including dessert at the beginning of the meal so that it seems like they are agile, but it takes you an hour and a half to eat. It's a shame that they cook well but can't wait on the tables as they should. It is in an office place where clients look for quick comet. They should try to improve this aspect"
ChIJx2bcv-UpQg0RuwTkoxpad7s,1,"The food has a very very basic quality.
As many users indicate, the quantity is minimal, but the quality and flavor is poor.
However, the most worrying thing is the service, how rude and unprofessional their waiters are, especially one of them, as soon as you talk to him, it will be very clear which ‚Äúindividual‚Äù he is.

This man gets upset when you ask him to take note of your order, his partner who should take note of your orders, ignores everything and thinks he is in a party room, joking and ignoring people completely.
Note that the person responsible has nothing to do with the previous ones. This is a friendly, busy and professional person.
Given the situation we were having, we asked for the person responsible.
It was her who we warned about the situation with the waiters and especially with the rude ‚Äúguy‚Äù.
He soon became interested in managing the problem and assisting us.
This same person was very polite and friendly.
Unfortunately, their team of waiters leaves much to be desired in terms of their rude and despotic attitude, a fact that clearly speaks of the type of ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù that you can find in this restaurant."
ChIJx2bcv-UpQg0RuwTkoxpad7s,5,"The menu options are not typical and it is appreciated.
The dishes are beautifully laid out and cooked with care, which is also appreciated.
The vegetable tempura was delicious (very good flavor, although with excess oil) and the chicken meatballs and carrot cake, too.
The staff friendly and willing to help. It didn't take them long to prepare my takeout meal.
The menu costs 13 euros, includes dessert or coffee but does not include a drink, something strange since they are the only ones in the area that do not include it for the same price.
As a note of improvement, larger portions would be appreciated for the menu price (compared to the rest of the options in the area)."
ChIJI5Yn-DYpQg0RZpT67vrlxGk,5,"We were eating at a friends celebration, and everything was great, the calm atmosphere, the unbeatable service and the very good, well-prepared food. The house wines are very good."
ChIJI5Yn-DYpQg0RZpT67vrlxGk,5,"It only allows access to chiefs and officers of the Navy or with an invitation from someone of that rank. Chiefs and officers from the Land, Air or Common Corps can also access it."
ChIJI5Yn-DYpQg0RZpT67vrlxGk,5,"Very good value for money, impeccable service, rather luxurious place."
ChIJI5Yn-DYpQg0RZpT67vrlxGk,5,"Laconada: abundant, very well prepared and served. Family atmosphere and excellent service"
ChIJI5Yn-DYpQg0RZpT67vrlxGk,5,"Very old people, all my respect to them. What we are and have today is thanks to their work and example."
ChIJf251JH4pQg0R4V219RKyahM,5,"Incredible place, so vibing, excellent stuff and food !"
ChIJf251JH4pQg0R4V219RKyahM,5,brutal
ChIJf251JH4pQg0R4V219RKyahM,5,God
ChIJf251JH4pQg0R4V219RKyahM,5,"A small restaurant but very well decorated.
The food is some of the best Mexican food I have ever tried, with the typical dishes but with a different touch.
I highlight the tortilla chips, the neta of birria or pibil, and the tamarind margarita! It is essential to try it!
SUITABLE FOR CELIACS"
ChIJf251JH4pQg0R4V219RKyahM,5,"We went for dinner during the week and the service was very friendly and fast. The food was great, the portions are large, the tacos come in 3 units and they don't skimp on the filling. We tried the esquites, flautas, tacos al pastor and tacos de birria. Everything is very delicious, we will return."
ChIJi6NgaC4pQg0Rs0RNDSz-UYk,4,"Excellent food, very good raw materials. The place is pretty but the food is worth it. Friendly and professional staff.  We will return without a doubt"
ChIJi6NgaC4pQg0Rs0RNDSz-UYk,5,"An ideal place to have some good wines and good food.
Very good service and always with a smile. Oscar very attentive to all clients
As Carlos says: La Caleya is fashionable"
ChIJi6NgaC4pQg0Rs0RNDSz-UYk,5,"My partner and I are from the neighborhood and we went yesterday to try it. We were missing a place in the area where we could eat well and the truth is that it was a success. The raw material is good and the service is even better. Oscar attended us, who is a charm. We will return for sure!"
ChIJi6NgaC4pQg0Rs0RNDSz-UYk,5,"The atmosphere is pleasant without stridency, the spectacular service making us feel at home, Oscar's team served us some very good ham croquettes as a starter, the roast lamb was simply and simply spectacular with its lettuce and onion, there were two of us and they gave us the rest to take away, I have been left with some steaks in my retina for, surely, future tastings, it is a restaurant that, despite being new, has a lot of tradition in the neighborhood with the nearby La Fontanica and 29 (now closed) that have always been in the neighborhood, totally advisable if you like things well done."
ChIJi6NgaC4pQg0Rs0RNDSz-UYk,5,"Muy recomendable para comer, tomar el aperitivo, buenos vinos y un servicio impecable.
Asados de cordero y cochinillo, carnes bien cortadas en su punto, un jam√≥n especial, todo riqu√≠simo!
Bravo por este equipazo, celebro su vuelta al barrio!
Gracias."
ChIJWZJaJjMpQg0R6QS0eJfM4CY,4,"Very nice neighborhood cafe, with a good variety of dishes."
ChIJWZJaJjMpQg0R6QS0eJfM4CY,2,"They have a nice terrace, it‚Äôs cheap and bathroom was clean, but that‚Äôs where the good part ends. The waiters were ok‚Ä¶ when they noticed you‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt seem to be very alert, they spent time idle and ignoring the customers. Food wasn‚Äôt nothing to send a postcard about, the kind of fries that came with the ‚Äúhuevos rotos‚Äù made them impossible to break and mix, which is the whole point of the dish. The burger meat was very low quality and chewy. Only the salad and bravas were acceptable. They forgot one of our 4 or five items, and eventually they gave our son a free ice cream, maybe to make up for it? We‚Äôll never know‚Ä¶ In conclusion, the place is good to get a drink and sit outside loaded with patience, but I don‚Äôt recommend their food, unless you are on a tight budget which is completely fair."
ChIJWZJaJjMpQg0R6QS0eJfM4CY,5,Really good bar for having breakfast
ChIJWZJaJjMpQg0R6QS0eJfM4CY,5,Very friendly local place. Pretty good prices with tapas. Football in the bar and often on the terrace which is in the central walkway on a quiet residential road. Tiny spanish park too.
ChIJWZJaJjMpQg0R6QS0eJfM4CY,4,"I like this place to have a drink seated under the trees. Also, a good place to meet. It is open until late on weekends."
ChIJiRbKiv0pQg0RUrUGLgodsV8,5,"Recently reopened due to change. The sunny terrace and awnings. Menu of the day and menu. Very spacious dining room. Very wide bar. Neighborhood meeting point. Events and celebration.

ChIJhbWuWjMpQg0R8aBK14NxFHo,5,Great local bar/restaurant. The food is always good here. Lovely atmosphere and well used by the locals. The staff are really friendly and make you feel welcome.
ChIJhbWuWjMpQg0R8aBK14NxFHo,3,"Typical neighborhood bar. It has a nice terrace. I have gone a couple of times to have an aperitif. With the drink they always serve potatoes or olives.
To improve the service, the waitresses are dry.
Value for money: good ‚Ç¨3.30 for a beer and a bottle of water on the terrace."
ChIJhbWuWjMpQg0R8aBK14NxFHo,5,"They attended to us very quickly and with a smile. We ordered chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãwith cider and scrambled eggs with chistorra. It was very good, in line with the price, no more no less. The terrace is in a super cozy and familiar corner. We will return"
ChIJhbWuWjMpQg0R8aBK14NxFHo,5,"Ideal place to eat, snack, dine!! Have a drink, any occasion is good to go üëè

ChIJwcL8wC8pQg0RXDs9H7yUvtE,5,"Both times we have come, it has been a great experience. The service is great, the food is super delicious and they care about whether you are eating well. In addition, they always serve cake with homemade coffee and a (very large) tapa of salad (both things are super delicious) and you can tell that all the dishes are homemade. 100 percent recommended üòä"
ChIJDdDqzMwuQg0R-nWDOns0PHQ,4,Good terrace. Handsome staff. They also serve half portions and guess what! Bitteballen in Madrid. I will come back
ChIJDdDqzMwuQg0R-nWDOns0PHQ,5,"My daughter ordered the burger and I had the toro tabo from the weekend menu. The waiter is very nice and super attentive. This place is a luxury, for its location, surrounded by gardens, as well as for the service and food."
ChIJDdDqzMwuQg0R-nWDOns0PHQ,5,"It's not cheap, peto is not expensive either, we ordered ham croquettes and patatas bravas (something simple) and they were very delicious. The girl who served us on the terrace was very nice. The worst thing is that there are stairs to go down to the bathroom (it was super clean)"
ChIJDdDqzMwuQg0R-nWDOns0PHQ,5,"My favorite place in the area. They always treat us very well and the food is delicious (whatever you order). A place we always go to and will return to. Familiar, close and very pleasant. Highly highly recommended."
ChIJDdDqzMwuQg0R-nWDOns0PHQ,4,"Great homemade food restaurant with good typical options.
From potato omelette, salads, Russian salad, croquettes, etc.
Good meats and stews.
Fish of the day.
It has a wonderful terrace, very pleasant and well attended."

It also looks amazing inside in the restaurant."
ChIJGdLBvGkvQg0R9x1oDgWpJ1Q,5,Amazing Indian food! Everything was so tasty and the service was fantastic. What a great find!
ChIJGdLBvGkvQg0R9x1oDgWpJ1Q,5,The best Indian in Madrid! I have eaten a lot of Indian food in my life but this has to be one of the best. Extremely delicious. Service was brilliant too we felt very welcome and were treated with kindness. We will be back! ü´∂üèΩ

ChIJHw5dXwQpQg0ReIBh4VgKJ7k,5,"A great experience. We loved the food: Eggplant Millefeuille, Baked Cod, Kebab Skewers and XXL Cannelloni. Everything was delicious and the desserts too (Torrija and Cheesecake). We will repeat for sure!!"
ChIJHw5dXwQpQg0ReIBh4VgKJ7k,5,"Very friendly staff, they serve very quickly, the food was very delicious and on Valentine's Day they gave us the gift of a cava with chocolates.
As a fan of cheesecakes, I recommend it 100 √ó 100"
ChIJHw5dXwQpQg0ReIBh4VgKJ7k,4,"Nice restaurant with modern decoration, very good service.
The food was good, highlighting the gutters."
ChIJHw5dXwQpQg0ReIBh4VgKJ7k,4,"Right next to the EFE agencyüì∞ is this fantastic option to eatüòä
We discoveredüïµÔ∏è the place through The Fork appüì± We were looking for a place to eat near the Chamart√≠n stationüöÑ Dbarra is a 10 minute walküö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è from the stationüëå

üè†The decoration of the place is very coolü§© and the menu invites both to share dishesüë´ and to each order their mainü•©
We decided to share. And we try:
- Eggplant millefeuilleüçÜ with fresh burrata, tomato sauceüçÖ and basil. Be careful!‚ö†Ô∏è, if you are not a big cheese loverüßÄ but can tolerate burrata/mozzarella, this is NOT your dish. They add a fairly strong cheese on top of the eggplants that is not indicated in the description of the dishü•≤
- Artichoke flower candied with ham shavings. The artichoke is very tender. It was the 2nd dish we liked the mostüëç
- Dbarra-style Russian salad with grilled shrimpüç§. It is an innovative salad. I would say that instead of tuna it has crabü¶Ä
- XXL meat cannelloni. We loved itü§§ The meat had a lot of flavor and there was a large amount of bechamel

üë®‚Äçüç≥ The service was very good and the cooking times were perfect.

üí∑ They charge for the service, ‚Ç¨2.50/people.

ChIJm-P_omcvQg0Rcd61LrWmIHs,5,Excellent service.  Delicious food. Great experience. The best  Thai for ages
ChIJm-P_omcvQg0Rcd61LrWmIHs,5,Really nice experience. We had the menu and everything was fantastic
ChIJm-P_omcvQg0Rcd61LrWmIHs,5,We love the place and the food. More than recommended!!
ChIJm-P_omcvQg0Rcd61LrWmIHs,5,Not my first time here. I will always come back and highly recommend.
ChIJm-P_omcvQg0Rcd61LrWmIHs,4,"Asian with a certain glamour. It is a beautiful restaurant with a garden in the center of the two floors and decoration according to its theme.
Correct service, typical food from that country, warn of spicy food, better to be moderate so as not to regret it later.
Price accordingly. They have a tasting menu for ‚Ç¨38 without a drink, it includes 2 desserts to choose from, it is better to choose the chocolate one and not the plain one (with a couple of cut mango pieces and a pasta in the middle, bathed in a cream that is not convincing, look at the photo).
It has an extensive menu of typical food and wines from different regions and nationalities, with some champagnes at exorbitant prices. Better to reserve"
ChIJRdmop5MvQg0RzxmuUDpwK0A,5,"We would highly recommend this restaurant .
The staff were exceptional .
We were a large group of 22 and they went out of there way to accommodate us.
The food was very nice and the service was spot on .
They paid attention to detail and really looked after us.
Emilio was so much fun and really made us feel welcome .
10/10
üòò"
ChIJRdmop5MvQg0RzxmuUDpwK0A,2,"too expensive for what it is.

order the pad thai only and thai iced tea.

thai iced tea was great.

green curry ternera was mid. disappointed. lacked creaminess and add some more coconut milk.

pad thai with 3 pieces of small cute shrimp was flavorful (only the best dish from there) SADLY, it's 25 euros for a tiny serving of pad thai.

chicken satay was good and tender.

duck rolls were overrated. the one from costco was much better. wink wink.

mango sticky rice was ok, but the sticky rice was not cooked well. only nice looking. for that price might as well fly in legit and better tasting mangoes. *eye roll*

their WHITE PLAIN AF RICE was 7 euros... smells good ~aromatic~ but thats it.
not worth getting it even though it should come with the curry for the price. feels like a scam to be honest.

the service was extremely slow and unprofessional.

at the end of the meal, the total bill can buy you a trip to bangkok for AUTHENTIC, BETTER, WELL PRICED, and FAST SERVICE thai food. no es broma."
ChIJRdmop5MvQg0RzxmuUDpwK0A,5,Great genuine thai restaurant in the hortaleza district. As you enter the place you are taken right into thailand by the spices scent and the tropical decor. Service was amazing and the food was amazing. We will be back.
ChIJRdmop5MvQg0RzxmuUDpwK0A,5,"Not spicy, tailored for the spice tolerance of the average spaniard which is basically zero. Overall a very good experience, the place itself is nicely decorated. The food is very well prepared. The only little negative thing was the menu pages stained with curry. But I can certainly live with that."
ChIJRdmop5MvQg0RzxmuUDpwK0A,5,"Brilliant restaurant owned bt Emilio.  Great service, elegantly dressed staff, yummy food prepared to us specifics, tastefully decorated, an experience to visit even the loo! Simply wow. Hope to be back here one day or more?"
ChIJ__KDCAApQg0RtI0NSBecXOo,5,"This restaurant has 3 locations, so evene if the place is full they will take you to another location and will find a place for you, the restaurant staff is amazing , very professional, great food!! And good atmosphere, the prices are fair enough in my opinion, definitely worth a visit if you are in the area."
ChIJ__KDCAApQg0RtI0NSBecXOo,5,"Great food and service at a good price!  We had dinner for two, and were then joined by 8 others who were all looked after very well - great burgers! And a vegan burger option for one of our guests!  Thank you!"
ChIJ__KDCAApQg0RtI0NSBecXOo,5,"Incredible stuff, great food and cozy place. Made all they could to to help us with Spanish menu, very friendly people. Highly recommended"

ChIJO1aD5EkpQg0RmPBQICeTnh0,5,"Fun place off the tourist path.
Good food and service. We had the grilled asparagus,  mixed salad, and grilled sea bass.
We were expecting smaller portions so we could have gotten away with just 2 dishes.
Recommended for sure."
ChIJO1aD5EkpQg0RmPBQICeTnh0,5,Excellent food and great service with a really fabulous atmosphere. Where the locals go!
ChIJO1aD5EkpQg0RmPBQICeTnh0,4,Good for drinks and side dishes. Good staff and ambient. Sometimes very crowded (this is the negative part)
ChIJSdBNMi0pQg0R1hIP_M5wLFs,5,"It's a great place to go get food and take it with you or to eat there. It's all very good.
Normally we order the menu but today I ordered the Piripi sandwich and it is spectacular. Plus it's quite big.
The best thing about both, they are loving caring. Thank you!"
ChIJSdBNMi0pQg0R1hIP_M5wLFs,5,"What a discovery.  Spectacular home cooking.  The unbeatable treatment.  Super accurate recommendations.

ChIJme6h-0kpQg0RLZNdAcNHy2o,5,"Very nice and attentive stuff. Fast service, good food, reasonable prices. Restaurant is on the first floor. There's a ramp that wheelchair could take to get inside. Parking on the street, so not very easy but possible."
ChIJme6h-0kpQg0RLZNdAcNHy2o,5,"Amazing staff and a comfortable space filled with natural light.

Also loved the desert.

ChIJme6h-0kpQg0RLZNdAcNHy2o,3,Service was good indeed as they came quite often to ask if we were satisfied.  However food was a disaster.
ChIJjRiKlcwuQg0R5Dl9pr-4ug0,5,"This was a wonderful experience. Overcoming the language and translation, I had a lovely evening meal.
The Sea Bass was beautifully cooked and because I cannot drink alcohol, they squeezed me a fresh orange juice.

A very well priced meal. Wonderful service.

I hope to go back soon."
ChIJjRiKlcwuQg0R5Dl9pr-4ug0,4,"Nice terrace, the owner is nice, and the food was good, although we were at the terrace, and it was totally full, so you can not expect a very quick attention... there were many young people from different countries :)"
ChIJjRiKlcwuQg0R5Dl9pr-4ug0,1,"One of the most unpleasant experiences, the waiter was not polite at all"
ChIJjRiKlcwuQg0R5Dl9pr-4ug0,5,"Just pass by this bar,  and found the steak was extraordinary together with the recommended wine"

ChIJ_be1cVcpQg0RANc5aBYlmfQ,5,"Came for a quick dinner with my daughter.  The place is very pleasant and the service quick and efficient.  We had the Pad Thai and the Nasi Goreng.  The Pad Thai was ok, but a bit sweet for my taste (I think this might be the Spanish way!).  The Nasi Goreng was an eclectic mix of cuisines (it had wakame, a Thai green curry, and some fruit), but it worked!  It was really tasty.  Even ordered one to go for the husband who couldn‚Äôt join us.  The portions are very big as well, so that‚Äôs a plus!"
ChIJ_be1cVcpQg0RANc5aBYlmfQ,5,Food and service were excellent.  Conveniently located next to the office. :)  Will be a regular here for sure.
ChIJ_be1cVcpQg0RANc5aBYlmfQ,5,"I went to eat on the weekend and I was delighted with everything, the food, the atmosphere and the attention of the excellent waiters. The sushi was delicious. Without a doubt I will repeat again"
ChIJ_be1cVcpQg0RANc5aBYlmfQ,5,"The truth is that it is a very good experience. The treatment is exquisite. Without a doubt, we will return.  We have ordered lacquered duck and Spicy Sichuan Dumpling and they are BRUUUUTAL!!!! The best Lacquered Duck I have ever tried."
ChIJ_be1cVcpQg0RANc5aBYlmfQ,5,"The site is lovingly placed and clean. The food is great, the sushi melts in your mouth and has a lot of flavor and at a very good price. 100% recommended"
ChIJGfR6yMwpQg0RPG4Rf_cn2co,5,"Very good food, the best terrace in the area, very good service, abundant portions at a good price and very good service. I recommend coming."
ChIJGfR6yMwpQg0RPG4Rf_cn2co,5,Abundant and quality menu at a good recommended price
ChIJGfR6yMwpQg0RPG4Rf_cn2co,5,"THE BEST TERRACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD: I was at this restaurant last Saturday. Pleasant surprise because I didn't know him. Of course, the best terrace in the neighborhood by far. Good atmosphere; quiet and noise-free terrace; Impeccable and attentive service. And, best of all, great value for money. Of course, from now on, I will be a regular customer. One hundred percent recommended."
ChIJGfR6yMwpQg0RPG4Rf_cn2co,1,"Total disappointment. Empty terrace while the other venues were full. Because‚ÄΩ. When we ordered they didn't have more than half of the dishes on the menu. The three portions we ordered were scarce anchovies, squid and chopitos and nothing out of this world... I don't think I'll go back."
ChIJGfR6yMwpQg0RPG4Rf_cn2co,2,"Bottles almost timeless. Draft beer only fresh. They ran out of draft ""without"" and there were 5 tables on a Friday... With this heat if the beer is not very cold, it is not worth coming back.
The only waitress is very friendly, the portions can be eaten. Normal prices.
When going to the bathroom we almost die from the heat inside the premises (without conditioned air), perhaps that is why the refrigerators are not enough these days.
If it is very hot: I advise not going."
ChIJKd791mkpQg0RsdF8sAJ4G-0,3,"Seems like a nice place to eat when you first enter. We had one nice waitress but the waiter was pretty cold. The service was a bit slow. 3 of the 4 dishes were ok.
We seemed to get sub-service which we thought was due to being non-local.
Would probably give them another opportunity as it‚Äôs next to the office."
ChIJKd791mkpQg0RsdF8sAJ4G-0,4,"We came here for a late dinner. Food was good, service was very attentive even with menu in English and atmosphere was good. I could imagine it would be great place to come in summer."
ChIJKd791mkpQg0RsdF8sAJ4G-0,2,"It was a disappointing experience. I couldn't eat the 'pulpo' I ordered, so I returned it. It wasn't fresh and has a bad smell. My wife eat the 'churritos de pollo' (sort of chicken fingers). It were ok, but not impressive."
ChIJKd791mkpQg0RsdF8sAJ4G-0,3,"OK food, OK selection of beers. Unless there's something I'm missing, that should sum it up.

Btw, they don't update the deals / ofertas on their website so don't go expecting the restaurant to reflect what you see on the website - this is not a complaint but a piece of advice."
ChIJKd791mkpQg0RsdF8sAJ4G-0,4,"While the menu has become more limited (Indian dishes like pani puri, Bengali chicken are no longer in the menu), the service from Virginia including suggestions were excellent. Suggest the menu becomes more international as it was earlier."
ChIJu49Yhi8pQg0R4lHUUQycrn4,5,"This local neighbourhood bar/restaurant is absolutely fantastic. The men√∫ del d√≠a is currently ‚Ç¨12 and is awesome. Very much home-cooked food, quite basic dishes etc but the quantity and quality is great. Good range of dishes to choose from. Service is great - super friendly. They have a terrace for warmer weather. Love it!"
ChIJu49Yhi8pQg0R4lHUUQycrn4,4,"Quite good good, good men√∫ and affordable price. Service very nice but a bit slow."

Good cuisine with poor organization, at good prices.

ChIJLYtTckgpQg0R0Jcs6f69JUY,5,Excellent catering. The food and service is really superb.
ChIJLYtTckgpQg0R0Jcs6f69JUY,5,GREAT food great service!
ChIJLYtTckgpQg0R0Jcs6f69JUY,3,Okay place for lunch menu.
ChIJLYtTckgpQg0R0Jcs6f69JUY,5,"Good service, in a restaurant, spacious and comfortable, the food very tasty and varied."
ChIJLYtTckgpQg0R0Jcs6f69JUY,5,"The truth is that for being in a business center, it is a quite nice place, with friendly service and super nice staff, they also serve you quickly and the food is homemade and very delicious."
ChIJ6aH9HMgpQg0RHEzqfs-iZbc,5,"The food here is fantastic! The wok and sushi are especially delicious. And the best part? The prices are super reasonable, and the portions are huge!"
ChIJ6aH9HMgpQg0RHEzqfs-iZbc,2,"The Chinese saleswoman tried to trick me, she charged me for 2 Wakame salads and I only took 1, clearly she knew this because she prepared the bag. I realized when he gave me the receipt with a global amount, I demanded another one with the breakdown of each product. He returned ‚Ç¨3 to me but it is an unacceptable practiceüëé"
ChIJ6aH9HMgpQg0RHEzqfs-iZbc,2,"I feel like they changed the recipes, we used to buy often but now it feels different and there is no Hong Kong chicken anymore, too bad, two months ago it was very very delicious. Looks like they changed the chef."
ChIJ6aH9HMgpQg0RHEzqfs-iZbc,5,"It is a stall inside the shopping center, everything they have is quite delicious and they make it right there."
ChIJ6aH9HMgpQg0RHEzqfs-iZbc,5,Super recommended! The food is very delicious!
ChIJadXneVkpQg0RujP_Ko1H8Jg,5,"The empanadas are delicious, especially the cheese and chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãempanada, delicious.
Pleasant customer service.
Reasonable prices with respect to quality."
ChIJadXneVkpQg0RujP_Ko1H8Jg,3,"I have tried too good to go. The price-quality ratio is excellent. There have been 5 empanadas. I don't rate more because there were three spicy ones and a fourth that shouldn't be spicy, and it was spicy. If you don't like spicy, don't risk it. If you don't have problems, it's a good option."
ChIJadXneVkpQg0RujP_Ko1H8Jg,5,The girls who serve are very rich and loving! I have loved them. It felt like in üá¶üá∑ü•∞
ChIJadXneVkpQg0RujP_Ko1H8Jg,5,"Hello, I'm Alberto, I'm 10 years old and my mother left me her phone number to leave a review.
I had 2 empanadillas and they were delicious, the employees were very nice, especially Ana, the bestüòç I will return soon"
ChIJadXneVkpQg0RujP_Ko1H8Jg,2,"I bought two empanadas thinking they would be of good quality and the truth is, they were quite bad. They heat them up right away, but they didn't have a very good filling. I ordered ham and cheese, and chorizo, and neither seemed very good to me. They had an offer that for a little more (30 cents or so) you had a drink included."
ChIJS6rYdUgpQg0Rlymm4I0gsyc,5,"We took our Sunday's lunch in terrace. Very nice polite and quick waiters served us very good quality of dishes. We enjoy of our lunch. Thanks to them .

We repeat to come here, as we live very close to the area."
ChIJS6rYdUgpQg0Rlymm4I0gsyc,5,"Great food (don‚Äôt miss the pizzas!), service, and price. I keep returning."
ChIJS6rYdUgpQg0Rlymm4I0gsyc,5,"Excellent food. Our waitress Gloria was charming and really attentive. Next time I‚Äôm here for work, I‚Äôll be back!"
ChIJS6rYdUgpQg0Rlymm4I0gsyc,5,Nice Italian restaurant!
ChIJS6rYdUgpQg0Rlymm4I0gsyc,1,We were waiting for food more than one hour. We are never coming back. Avoid this place.
ChIJ05ciiUkpQg0RpMV7xjrPqJg,2,Cosy place and good service. Sadly the Sandwiches tasted quite old / not fresh.
ChIJ05ciiUkpQg0RpMV7xjrPqJg,4,"We stopped to have a few beers as an aperitif before eating, one of the few bars we found in the area. I liked it, I don't know the reason for so many complaints: very cold thirds, with more than correct prices (‚Ç¨2.50) and an interesting bar of pinchos that they brought out, some freshly made. They gave us some good-sized croquettes as an accompaniment. Good overall."
ChIJ05ciiUkpQg0RpMV7xjrPqJg,5,"A place that was next to my house and where I have only gone a couple of times to have a few beers (and the truth is that they gave me some delicious tapas) but the truth is that I had never considered eating until now that we went on a Thursday as we have the offices next door.

Good service, a homemade menu for 10 euros, a cool old atmosphere and an Ol√© radio to set the mood for the meal.

As you will see from my photos, the second dish on the menu (the churrasco) is huge, it took me a hell of a time to finish it (and in fact I had a little left over)

The crab salad I had first was also quite delicious. The dessert was a delicious cake with toasted yolk and cream.

And I don't forget to highlight that as soon as we sat down at the table he gave us a bottle of house wine and a homemade one. And he didn't even ask us about drinks, so here we drink wine with the menu no matter what (although it is true that he later brought a jug of water without having to ask for it)"
ChIJ05ciiUkpQg0RpMV7xjrPqJg,5,"We ordered wings, a tomato salad, steak and calamari. Previously, with the beers they did not release some tapas that were not bad at all. Not only was everything of good quality, but it had been a while since I had seen the head chef come out to ask how everything seemed to us. Large terrace. Good attention. Great price."
ChIJ05ciiUkpQg0RpMV7xjrPqJg,1,"Terrible attention. We ordered some beers on the terrace, we asked a question about the food and the answer was ‚Äúyou have it on the menu‚Äù and they never came back. More and more we asked if we could sit with our dog, the answer was ‚Äúif it doesn't bother the other customers‚Ä¶‚Äù Well, we really wanted to drink the beer and nothing more."
ChIJxYPOSgApQg0Rc6PffwOKI0k,5,"An excellent restaurant with a cozy atmosphere and impeccable service. The dishes are well prepared, with fresh ingredients and balanced flavors. Both the presentation and the quality of the food stand out. Ideal for a special meal or a casual outing. I will definitely return."
ChIJxYPOSgApQg0Rc6PffwOKI0k,1,"The amazing terrace, if we talk about the gastronomic experience I bite my tongue.
They have given us a toast with avocado and lettuce in bad condition (I think they are from August) in addition to deducting ‚Ç¨2 from the total price when we told them.
They were missing basic products such as potatoes so we had to change our choice when ordering.
In short, highly recommended!"
ChIJxYPOSgApQg0Rc6PffwOKI0k,5,"We have been coming daily to have a beer in the afternoons for a long time. The place is super nice and they serve us great!! We feel at home. From the owners to Fio, everyone is super nice!!!
Highly recommended!"
ChIJxYPOSgApQg0Rc6PffwOKI0k,5,"A crazy bar, they serve you at the first abundant meal that is also very delicious and the treatment of the waiters is magnificent, to return a thousand times more without a doubt.
Recommended: cachopo, meats‚Ä¶"
ChIJxYPOSgApQg0Rc6PffwOKI0k,5,"I have breakfast there every day since I work across the street. The service is fabulous, a great couple run the concession.
The potato omelette is incredible, but you have to hurry because it runs out!!
They know how to make coffee how it should be made.
The only place you should have breakfast on Avenida de Burgos.
Very very very nice in the afternoon for an afterwork beer!"
ChIJwygOFrIpQg0RePYbC5t40l4,4,"Table packed with decent tapas after each round. Food quality wasn‚Äôt the best but good place for a drink overall, away from all the tourist traps from central Madrid."
ChIJwygOFrIpQg0RePYbC5t40l4,5,"My experience is 10. Valeria and Ainhoa ‚Äã‚Äãare extremely attentive and friendly, doing everything possible to make us feel comfortable, as well as Juan. The cook, M. Carmen, spectacular: The secret sauce in the cheese, the chicken wings, the potato omelet with caramelized onion, etc. In addition, different environments for all tastes and educated clientele."
ChIJwygOFrIpQg0RePYbC5t40l4,5,"I have gone to eat the menu of the day and everything was very good, good value for money, friendly waiters and it was great on the terrace"
ChIJwygOFrIpQg0RePYbC5t40l4,1,"We made a reservation for dinner and to watch a game with the bad luck that the very drunk boss gave us dinner, with annoying visitors, playing loud music and finally with unbearable treatment he told us that, at p. street, leaving the game and dinner halfway. Regrettable."
ChIJwygOFrIpQg0RePYbC5t40l4,5,"Wonderful attention, phenomenal food. The luxury waiters behave excellently with customers. The tortillas and the fingers uhmmmm ‚ò∫Ô∏è everything is very delicious.
Recommended 100% üòâ"
ChIJRYR2S88uQg0RwhgBJb9g0Wg,4,"The truth is that the site is very good. It's a neighborhood bar where they have a menu of Spanish dishes and Asian dishes, so it's a good combination. We ordered a little variety and ate very well. There were quite a few people and they warned us that the food would take a long time to arrive (in case we wanted to think about staying there) but since we weren't in a hurry we waited and in the end the wait wasn't that long. We were on the terrace and the tables are quite close together since it is a small space. We just had a fairly large group next door (they arrived about halfway through the meal) and the noise was very noticeable. Although well, that in the end is not the restaurant's fault (because many more arrived than it seemed they had reserved due to the number of chairs at the table). We will surely return."
ChIJRYR2S88uQg0RwhgBJb9g0Wg,5,The homemade rice is very good and the sweet and sour pork is very good too.
ChIJRYR2S88uQg0RwhgBJb9g0Wg,1,"The bar was empty. We ordered two drinks and two glasses of water, telling them to also bring us the food menu because four people and a child were going to dinner. With a cocky attitude the waitress wanted to force us to order bottles of water, literally quoting ""you drink glasses of water at home, in a bar you ask for bottles."""
ChIJRYR2S88uQg0RwhgBJb9g0Wg,4,"This restaurant changed ownership a few months ago. They have Chinese and Spanish food. It is an economical place, the menu with wine and homemade is 8.50. Then you have the menu, also in the bar part you can have a good cold beer. It has a large terrace compared to the bars in the area. Lucy's attention is very good. The crispy duck is very good. I don't know why Google, when a restaurant changes owners, doesn't delete the previous owner's reviews."
ChIJRYR2S88uQg0RwhgBJb9g0Wg,5,"Run by a Chinese family...
Dishes from Chinese and Spanish culture.
You freak out with the tortilla and the wings. üòç"
ChIJB_2IvM8uQg0RO3Caded7jq4,5,"2 adults and 2 small children.
Had burgers and lomo bajo.
Everything was delicious and in terms of value for money was one of the best meals we've had in Berlin.
The service was very warm, basic English is spoken at the bar but with good attitude that was not a problem.
Plus - the Guinness was great.
Highly recommended, would definitely go there again."
ChIJB_2IvM8uQg0RO3Caded7jq4,4,"Visited two days in a row - Great for individuals or couples, not so great for groups."
ChIJB_2IvM8uQg0RO3Caded7jq4,5,".. good service, stuff and lovely place, highly recommend.."
ChIJB_2IvM8uQg0RO3Caded7jq4,4,"Always great for a few beers/drinks.
The staff bring you loads of tapas with every round."
ChIJB_2IvM8uQg0RO3Caded7jq4,5,"Awesome food, cold beer, wonderful service
Highly recommend the place!!!"
ChIJaV5fGcguQg0R3Qlnq2kIh38,5,"Bravas and the mixto were great, the service was even better!"
ChIJaV5fGcguQg0R3Qlnq2kIh38,5,Super!!.
ChIJaV5fGcguQg0R3Qlnq2kIh38,5,"I have been living in this neighborhood for more than 8 years and I had this bar close to my house, but I had never been there. Well, too bad, because it is a great place to have an aperitif, eat portions or have dinner.

They put interesting tapas with the drink and the staff is very friendly and approachable.

In addition, the omelette is very good, sometimes we order it to order to pick up and take at home."
ChIJaV5fGcguQg0R3Qlnq2kIh38,5,"Excellent service, very appetizing tapas, clean, pleasant, place with the possibility of parking without paying. Great for tapas or a morning of snacks."
ChIJaV5fGcguQg0R3Qlnq2kIh38,5,"I was eating a menu of the day and it is the best quality/price that you can find in the neighborhood.
First I ordered a zucchini cream that came with croutons and it was very good, for the second I chose lean with tomato and it did not disappoint, both the flavor and the quantity were great.
Finally, they give you the choice between dessert or coffee. I personally like to finish with a sweet touch so I decided to have a rice pudding that was finger-licking good.
The menu includes bread, drink, starter, main course and dessert or coffee for only ‚Ç¨10.
I recommend it and I would repeat it again without a doubt since I was looking forward to trying some of their portions."
ChIJQ3qV6LcuQg0R9oMAOGoZxC4,5,Service very good and nice people.

ChIJQ3qV6LcuQg0R9oMAOGoZxC4,5,"Lovely people, professional service and excellent food. Very extensive menu and menu with many options. With the dining room full they made efforts to accommodate us. Unbeatable quality/price."
ChIJQ3qV6LcuQg0R9oMAOGoZxC4,5,"Restaurant with homemade style food, very good quality/quantity/price ratio. The treatment will be a mirror effect since you will be treated according to how you treat yourself, being respectful. In my case, they have always treated me very well; It is a very close and warm treatment. On the other hand, the dishes have always been very abundant and delicious. Of my favorite dishes I can highlight the cachopo with cured meat and Cabrales cheese and the house burger... As I usually say in my reviews whose score is high: They don't deserve 5 stars, they deserve all the stars in the universe."
ChIJQ3qV6LcuQg0R9oMAOGoZxC4,5,La comida incre√≠ble. Terraza amplia y zona muy tranquila. Repetiremos.
ChIJfQ8LsRwvQg0RlPhCvgQKCP0,5,"For the price, great flavour. All the classics done just how you want them."
ChIJfQ8LsRwvQg0RlPhCvgQKCP0,4,"Consistent, fresh seafood plates. Try the fried sepia (cuttlefish) or calamares. Sometimes they have pescado adobado (fried seasoned whitefish). Huevos rotos (fried eggs chopped on home fries and bits of Serrano ham or chorizo are great. Like most places in Spain pass on the burgers and dogs. Outdoors terrace. Neighborhood place. Busy but the father and son team hustle to make it happen."
ChIJfQ8LsRwvQg0RlPhCvgQKCP0,4,Good value for the price

ChIJfQ8LsRwvQg0RlPhCvgQKCP0,5,Friendly and attentive
ChIJ7zuzBc8uQg0RJsv0LTBcq3I,5,Like a bar in a village. Curiosity within the city of Madrid
ChIJ7zuzBc8uQg0RJsv0LTBcq3I,4,Buenos torreznos
ChIJ7zuzBc8uQg0RJsv0LTBcq3I,1,"A shame, so that their regular customers don't get cold, they leave the premises insufficiently ventilated, violating anti-covid measures.
With how easy it is to invite people to wear a sweater and leave the door open..."
ChIJ7zuzBc8uQg0RJsv0LTBcq3I,5,"Bar run by Carlos, a very nice Portuguese man, he makes you a very good francesinha and the bacalhau a bras.... without words, a 10 of the real ones!!"

ChIJa_I4HskuQg0RgW3-3aZg5Tw,5,"I came for lunch with my parents and my husband and the experience was a 10!!
Very nice place, everything very clean and neat.
The attention and the food are spectacular!!!!!!!!! Everything was excellent!! We ordered garlic shrimp, an omelette and cheesecake for dessert! The shrimp and the omelet were freshly made, that detail is not minor üòã‚ô•Ô∏è
Super recommended!!!
It was our first time, but there is no doubt that it will not be the last!!!"
ChIJa_I4HskuQg0RgW3-3aZg5Tw,3,"Se come normal, ni mal ni bien. Si buscas un gallego, no es aqu√≠ ni de co√±a. Las filloas son crepes, que cojones? Los torreznos est√°n buenos y el raxo tambi√©n. Los camareros son majos, pero el sitio y la comida, es de un bar de viejos de barrio (eso no es malo). Lo recomiendo? Si est√°s por la zona y quieres picar, bueno. Quieres comer en un sitio bueno y barato? Aqu√≠ no es."
ChIJa_I4HskuQg0RgW3-3aZg5Tw,5,"My favorite in the neighborhood.
It is eaten well, the preparation of the dish is good and the flavor exquisite.
The staff's treatment is pleasant and respectful (something that is difficult to find today). They have a good wine list and for dessert the cheesecake is a 10!

We always return with the family because it is worth going to eat something delicious, well priced and in a pleasant atmosphere."
ChIJa_I4HskuQg0RgW3-3aZg5Tw,5,"I have eaten there several times and I really like it, the place is small but they have a very nice terrace. Very delicious homemade food and very attentive and polite staff."
ChIJa_I4HskuQg0RgW3-3aZg5Tw,5,I have celiac disease and the waiter was super kind in serving me and confirming in the kitchen that what I was ordering was gluten-free or cross-contaminated. Plus everything was very delicious! More places like this in the neighborhood!!
ChIJhYIMfR0vQg0RlQmzy1HRtDM,5,Great sushi place quality-price. I ordered some sushi and duck gyozas for take away. Good taste.
ChIJhYIMfR0vQg0RlQmzy1HRtDM,5,"What a surprise!! We loved it, very good presentation, price and it was very good. We recommend the sushi, the gyozas were good, but you could tell that their specialty is sushi. There was also a lot of sauce."
ChIJhYIMfR0vQg0RlQmzy1HRtDM,1,Fui hasta ah√≠ y me dijo que no nos serv√≠an nada que hay que pedirlo por glovo
ChIJhYIMfR0vQg0RlQmzy1HRtDM,5,"The truth is that it surprised me, small but comfortable place, very good and quality, 100% recommended and fast.
I will go to this site more frequently. Excellent"
ChIJhYIMfR0vQg0RlQmzy1HRtDM,2,"I didn't like it, I ordered it by glovo. For my taste a lot of sauce and excessive spiciness"
ChIJ7X5lfewvQg0RcGEjqmgSUjA,5,"We ordered Sushi through Uber Eats, it was really good. We were surprised by how tasty they were, the avocado they put in it was spectacular. We always ordered the 2 for 1 deals from Miss Sushi but lately the sushi hasn't been good at all. This one is better by far!"
ChIJ7X5lfewvQg0RcGEjqmgSUjA,5,"Very rich and good prices
We always go there, take away...
I recommend it"

ChIJT1yAvM8uQg0RqNLebSfbH90,5,Very varied and quality menu. Friendly treatment and excellent service.
ChIJT1yAvM8uQg0RqNLebSfbH90,4,"Asian food place, there is a little of everything. The food is good and not expensive. The service is quite good, the terrace is very pleasant."
ChIJT1yAvM8uQg0RqNLebSfbH90,5,"Delicious dishes, very pleasant and calm atmosphere."
ChIJT1yAvM8uQg0RqNLebSfbH90,4,"Everything was very delicious, but too much noise and tight"
ChIJS_M1SAovQg0RuzAu5wGT44M,5,"Although I was initially cautious due to their big selection of different Asian cuisines the restaurant turned out to be really good.
On my first visit I had Edamame, Wakame and assorted sushi , all of which were fine. On my second visit I had duck sushi (never had that before, it was good) and fried noodles with prawns, which were also very good.
Given that the place was always pretty packed, the kitchen must be spot on because we got our food fast and it was fresh."
ChIJS_M1SAovQg0RuzAu5wGT44M,4,Excelente Asian restaurant. We have been many time and everything is s√∫per tastey
ChIJS_M1SAovQg0RuzAu5wGT44M,3,"Food and service was ok. Not bad, but not great. Prices were ok. I'd recommend trying it as they have a great selection to choose from"
ChIJS_M1SAovQg0RuzAu5wGT44M,5,"Great quality, nice dish sizes, not overpriced and fast service. Only negative point I found is that their takoyaki does not resemble the real Japanese one, but is still delicious"
ChIJS_M1SAovQg0RuzAu5wGT44M,3,Decent quality oriental restaurant in a quiet residential area. A really varied menu full of options including sushi and even some Thai. Really popular at lunchtime and even has a terrace if you fancy eating outside.
ChIJkYD1XS0vQg0RTr98w19DdbI,5,Excellent
ChIJkYD1XS0vQg0RTr98w19DdbI,5,"We ordered my cousin's communion cake and it was spectacular, highly recommended, we loved that it was super soft and delicious as well as pretty"
ChIJkYD1XS0vQg0RTr98w19DdbI,5,"IT EXCEEDS ALL MY EXPECTATIONS.
The truth is that both in terms of attention, service, and product quality it has been a 10 out of 10. Ari treated me and he was super friendly and detailed. The cake turned out delicious and although I only ordered the cake with the topping. He understood perfectly what we wanted to do with the decoration since we had the details to decorate it and we got it right. The cake is delicious and the flavors are very delicate and delicious. I recommend 1000% and of course I will repeat without hesitation. THANK YOU SO MUCH"
ChIJkYD1XS0vQg0RTr98w19DdbI,5,"Nos atendi√≥ Mer, una chica absolutamente encantadora. Nos ayudo a elegir la comida, y los c√≥cteles.
Siempre con una sonrisa, y una palabra agradable. As√≠ da gusto q te traten."
ChIJkYD1XS0vQg0RTr98w19DdbI,5,A wonderful pastry and service. I ordered a cake and it was fabulous! They understood perfectly what I wanted.
ChIJrZnU88guQg0Rf5j-LLIH3nc,4,"Had a nice coffee, churros and porras.

Came out about to explode. Not a lot more I can review.

Coffee was nice and food was acceptable.

Will come back."

ChIJrZnU88guQg0Rf5j-LLIH3nc,5,"I was in the area and wanted to have a coffee, I walked through the door and sat on the terrace to have my coffee, I saw that they had a menu of the day and I also stayed to eat. The food is very good and the quantities are very abundant, I ordered the full menu and then I heard that you could order half a menu, which would have been ideal since I couldn't finish it due to the quantities they offer.

I would repeat but next time I will order half a menu which is more than enough.

The staff's treatment is pleasant and fast."
ChIJrZnU88guQg0Rf5j-LLIH3nc,5,"Un lugar maravilloso para ir a comer, el men√∫ es muy variado cada d√≠a, la calidad de la comida es excelente, la cantidad maravillosa incluso por dem√°s, el trato del personal inmejorable y muy cercano. Da gusto ir tanto para comer como para tomar algo."
ChIJrZnU88guQg0Rf5j-LLIH3nc,5,"A very nice place. Good deal. Good menu of the day with many options, combined dishes, sandwiches and a very delicious ham and tomato breakfast."
ChIJgWHJ8sguQg0RB6uwNGBHBB0,3,"Cool place for a quick pint.

A few options on the beer side but not so good with wines.

Comes with a complimentary tapa, not the best either, just some chips or olives."
ChIJgWHJ8sguQg0RB6uwNGBHBB0,4,"Five star football.
Good place to watch your team's games. There is a variety of beers, from the best brands (although some make jokes, see the photos) and good wine too. We ordered food but all things that could be ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù without neglecting the television. The waiter treated us wonderfully. Good trade and drinks, in short. To put it another way, our team tied. We will return to see his victory, God willing."
ChIJgWHJ8sguQg0RB6uwNGBHBB0,5,"Excellent attention.
Very good appetizers with the drink.
Possibility of ordering half portions, which is appreciated.
Very delicious toasts.
The portions are very good, I recommend the calamari, the boneless Kentucky chicken, the Russian salad, the broken eggs, the anchovies both in vinegar and fried.
Emphasize care when preparing food for the celiac girl, ensuring that her food is not contaminated, with prior notice. üëèüèªüëèüèª"
ChIJgWHJ8sguQg0RB6uwNGBHBB0,5,I went to the bar with my partner. The waiters gave us excellent service. They are very kind people. It is also worth noting that they give you super good tapas. I recommend this place. Greetings.
ChIJgWHJ8sguQg0RB6uwNGBHBB0,5,"In vacation rental next door we made it our canteen because of the welcome, the service and the unbeatable value for money, thank you Momo"
ChIJIRCll8guQg0RKSU9jFg3IrU,4,Nice little garden area to sit outside!
ChIJIRCll8guQg0RKSU9jFg3IrU,4,Friendly local bar in Hortaleza. Terrace to the side.
ChIJIRCll8guQg0RKSU9jFg3IrU,5,"Homemade, quality food at a very good price. We ordered dishes from the menu of the day and we liked everything very much!

When we entered we saw the potato omelette and we were impressed, let's see if we can try it another day because it looked amazing.

Wonderful and close treatment, we felt at home.

In the photos: peas with ham, whiting and two desserts (macedonia with yogurt and puff pastry cake)."
ChIJIRCll8guQg0RKSU9jFg3IrU,5,A place where the food is phenomenal and the cuisine is very homemade. The atmosphere and place are very pleasant and welcoming. Its owners make you feel at home.
ChIJIRCll8guQg0RKSU9jFg3IrU,5,"Very good and homemade food. The service was unbeatable, they advised us on dishes (very good tortilla pinxo and lac√≥n dish) and they were kind and friendly at all times. We will definitely return"
ChIJt09Myu0vQg0RoFc7yNxA9K4,3,"Bonita terraza con buen ambiente. Bar ideal para tomar unas cervezas. Las raciones un poco caras para lo que son. Alitas de pollo 9‚Ç¨ y ven√≠an 5, en 10 trozos, huevos rotos 11‚Ç¨, patatas congeladas y jam√≥n del malo con dos huevos a la plancha. Es una pena porque subiendo un poquito la calidad y la limpieza era todo congelado, el sitio estar√≠a genial. Atenci√≥n del personal muy agradable."
ChIJt09Myu0vQg0RoFc7yNxA9K4,5,"We go here regularly to spend an afternoon. Always pleasant service, tasty snacks and dishes, good atmosphere. We like it a lot."
ChIJt09Myu0vQg0RoFc7yNxA9K4,5,"Perfect neighborhood bar to have a drink with friends. We were on the terrace and it was luxurious in the sun. When I sat down he brought me a beer without even asking for it, crack!"
ChIJt09Myu0vQg0RoFc7yNxA9K4,5,"Super nice terrace, friendly and attentive waiters, well-priced drinks and delicious food. You can't ask for more."
ChIJt09Myu0vQg0RoFc7yNxA9K4,1,"I'm eating right now, there are 4 of us, they only bring us the food for two and when those two have finished the food for the other two, of course, 4 of us have gone to eat and we have eaten twice, we have had to tell him to clean our table of the previous people, otherwise they won't even collect the glasses from other customers. Plus it's August and there are almost no people, I don't want to imagine when it will be full, I'm from the neighborhood and I don't plan to return. Terrible service."
ChIJNzOMjGsvQg0R6RsrE_1uwPA,5,"Excellent!!! Good size, good color, crunchy, the dough with a special sweet touch, with enough filling with a divine seasoning, good sauce. It exceeded my expectations and I am leaving Madrid happy to have eaten these empanadas that I cannot find in Oslo. As a recommendation, offer a local telephone number that can be called. I'll be back!"
ChIJNzOMjGsvQg0R6RsrE_1uwPA,5,"A very cozy place, with good music and very good service.
Delicious food, delicious empanadas.
In summary it is a 10 out of 10.
Highly recommended!"
ChIJNzOMjGsvQg0R6RsrE_1uwPA,4,"Small bar with outdoor terrace and some indoor seating. They have few food or tapas options, but everything is delicious and in large quantities. The Venezuelan empanadas are the star and it is a must to try them, they are tremendous. They also have special cocktails and shakes that looked very good. To put it another way, the service, without being bad, was somewhat slow and distant. Otherwise a highly recommended place."
ChIJNzOMjGsvQg0R6RsrE_1uwPA,5,"I ordered delivery, and the empanadas are brutal. I love that the seasoning of the chicken and meat is homemade, they have a lot of flavor. We also ordered the corn teque√±os and WOW they surprised us a lot for the better. Without a doubt, we will repeat. I would like to visit the place to try more things. 100000000% recommended!"
ChIJNzOMjGsvQg0R6RsrE_1uwPA,4,"Very modern tapas and drinks bar for the area, we liked the attention they gave us"
ChIJM0xu0MUuQg0RfbJbsxuxh6Y,5,"Homemade food with very good flavor and good price, I could eat here every day. The paella ü•ò incredibly good. Recommended and with very good attention from Felipe and Mr. Juan"
ChIJM0xu0MUuQg0RfbJbsxuxh6Y,1,"We have come a few times both to eat and to have a drink. The food is good, just like that, cheap and you get out of trouble, close but very careless, they forget things, not to mention that the waiter is drinking his own while he is putting your beer. I wouldn't come, there are many bars in the area where you have good breakfast and lunch and the service is a thousand times better."
ChIJM0xu0MUuQg0RfbJbsxuxh6Y,5,"Quality menu of the day with traditional food, as it should be. Very pleasant terrace, especially in spring and autumn.
Good service, despite always being full of customers."
ChIJM0xu0MUuQg0RfbJbsxuxh6Y,3,"Nice terrace and helpful and fast waiter.
Price somewhat high for the area for some drinks and coffees.
The waiter told us a price and at the bar they tried to charge us another more expensive price"
ChIJM0xu0MUuQg0RfbJbsxuxh6Y,5,"Bar with attached dining room. Homemade menus, portions and simple but worthy appetizers that are served when you have a wine or a beer. Very friendly atmosphere for people from the neighborhood and especially older pensioners. The service is good and the lady who must be responsible for the kitchen does it very well. Advisable"
ChIJH5gwccguQg0R0wi1tzacSUQ,5,"No doubt that this is the best Kebap bar in Hortaleza neighborhood and probably from all Madrid. Small place, but really good service and food quality. Totally recommended"
ChIJH5gwccguQg0R0wi1tzacSUQ,3,Buenos kebab
ChIJH5gwccguQg0R0wi1tzacSUQ,1,"The thing in the photo is not chicken but lettuce.
It hurt me to have to give it a star because what we received is enough to give it a 0. The kebabs were half open, we all ordered tomato and it didn't have it, the sauce comes in zip bags, it took an hour, the meat had pieces of bone and the worst thing was the lettuce, which was completely in bad condition and we'll see if it makes us feel bad (look at the photos). Unfortunately we noticed the brown lettuce when we were almost finished.
I do not recommend asking anyone and if we get gastroenteritis we will call health.

Edit: Indeed, all of us who ate it had diarrhea and an upset stomach."
ChIJH5gwccguQg0R0wi1tzacSUQ,1,"They take a long time, they don't find out and Asta charges you more to come and they don't find out, you have to repeat things 50 times and cold food and a month ago I ordered it and they swallowed it cold after two hours of waiting"
ChIJH5gwccguQg0R0wi1tzacSUQ,1,Ped√≠ un kebab y la carne estaba en mal estado. Lo Ped√≠ solo con carne y me he pasado la noche vomitando. Antes ped√≠a siempre el kebab de aqu√≠ pero no volver√© a repetir nunca m√°s. Horroroso!!!
ChIJ8bR6ecguQg0RtZ42c6-RCWU,5,Very welcoming people and great hamburguesas!
ChIJ8bR6ecguQg0RtZ42c6-RCWU,4,Ok
ChIJ8bR6ecguQg0RtZ42c6-RCWU,1,"We ordered two sandwiches: the chicken sandwich was cold and the loin sandwich was RAW and a strange color. The bread was frozen and the place didn't feel too clean. However, the service was good: the woman was very nice and kind. I won't come back."
ChIJ8bR6ecguQg0RtZ42c6-RCWU,5,Pollos muy ricos y sabrosos hace tiempo que los conozco y siempre que puedo me acerco a por unos .los precios son razonables y hay variedad de cosas la se√±ora que lo lleva es muy agradable y te aconseja y aclara cualquier duda y pregunta ya son conocidos en la zona y merece la pena probar el pollo asado que hacen
ChIJ8bR6ecguQg0RtZ42c6-RCWU,3,"It is a family business and the lady who runs it is very nice. The place as such is not very ""inviting"", the potatoes are of course frozen, but to pick up a quick order or have it delivered when nothing is prepared, it can be taken into account.

The chicken was good, I would say okay but nothing remarkable.

I don't know if I would order again."
ChIJRTw6vuUvQg0Rs5ISYskNrEQ,5,Delicious kebabs with fresh ingredients and amazing flavours. Everything prepared in one moment by the friendly team originally from Pakistan üáµüá∞ highly recommended thanks üëèüèª

ChIJRTw6vuUvQg0Rs5ISYskNrEQ,5,Beautiful
ChIJVRy1bgIvQg0R0X5mNqiac5I,4,"The durum de pollo was delicious.   I was disappointed in the fried chicken, as it was overcooked and dry."
ChIJVRy1bgIvQg0R0X5mNqiac5I,3,"Comida rapida...fast food to stop and eat especially late at night when you dont have time to prepare food at home or when you are rushing.. Mostly their fried chicken and chicken chunks is too deep fried like you can taste the reapeted oil used for frying..Sometimes its burned edges is too hard ,maybe bescause the flour coating is too thick..
prefer bread than rice when ordering because the basmati rice used is a bit too strong smell..Over all its fine for a hungry tummy üëç"
ChIJVRy1bgIvQg0R0X5mNqiac5I,5,Good food
ChIJVRy1bgIvQg0R0X5mNqiac5I,5,Was good and taste good
ChIJVRy1bgIvQg0R0X5mNqiac5I,5,"The food in this store is very tasty, I loved it, I have made my lunch and dinner here, the service is amazing and the way they treat their customers is amazing."
ChIJ35Ss928vQg0RKtlcWHk4_os,4,"Everything we ate was very good. The charcoal entrec√¥te is very delicious. Good appetizer of battered cod. The bar is small, it is focused on food. Good attention from Debora."
ChIJ35Ss928vQg0RKtlcWHk4_os,5,We have eaten the daily menu for ‚Ç¨15 and we liked it very much. The waitress with dark hair and a very nice ponytail.
ChIJ35Ss928vQg0RKtlcWHk4_os,4,"The old cub, located in the Hortaleza neighborhood, the truth is that the food is good, we ordered three dishes, a probolone with shrimp, an omelette (very good) and rice with oxtail."
ChIJ35Ss928vQg0RKtlcWHk4_os,5,"The staff was very friendly and helpful, the food was exquisite. We ate an oxtail paella, one of the best I have ever had. 100x100 recommended. The decoration helps you relax and enjoy a good meal with family and friends. They also have a bar in case you just want to have a drink or while you wait for the rest. You will leave pleased."
ChIJ35Ss928vQg0RKtlcWHk4_os,4,"We went to eat for Mother's Day and despite being packed, the service was good, a little slow for obvious reasons but nothing compared to other restaurants this day. There was noise in the restaurant but it was not uncomfortable. The food is good, but for me the torreznos were outstanding, the provoleta was very greasy, and the octopus was overcooked, there were burnt and hard pieces. The bienme tastes very good, the sauce on the croquettes and the croquettes are very good, the chicken quesadilla is tastier than the beef one, the burrata salad is better than the belly salad. For dessert, the cheesecake was very top, the torrija was good but it was bathed in a vanilla soup"
ChIJ234worUuQg0Rnz69cZEOa9s,5,Top
ChIJ234worUuQg0Rnz69cZEOa9s,3,Bar normal
ChIJ234worUuQg0Rnz69cZEOa9s,5,"Jes√∫s, Alex and Ana...three fantastic professionals who attend to you closely.
The most important thing is that everything is VERY GOOD, and unbeatable value for money.
Special attention to the croquettes, cheese, squid, Rioja-style potatoes... In fact, anything you order is very tasty."
ChIJ234worUuQg0Rnz69cZEOa9s,5,Spectacular menu of the day with 100% homemade food. Generous portions and very successful appetizers. A reference in Hortaleza and on top of that with a wonderful terrace. I give him a 100 on the deal!!
ChIJ234worUuQg0Rnz69cZEOa9s,5,"I have three things in life that give me happiness; Grilled Ear with brava sauce, a well-pulled and cold Estrella Galicia on tap and One Piece. I went here first because of the Name Piccolo, damn he's Gohan's teacher, just for that reason already inside. But inside, inside came what I call, hospitality excellence. I sat at the bar, because I'm a bar guy, I ordered the grilled ear with its crust and my cold Galicia on tap. While watching my fikadas. The fact is that the quality of the food was wonderful, and you may think that it is easy to make an ear but no, it is not, making it tender and crunchy at the same time is a gift that few succeed in, just like throwing an ear good tap tap with a finger and a half of foam so that it does not lose strength and flavor. The waiter, a young guy who is at your disposal without stopping working at all times.  I don't know... I guess there's nothing special about it, but why does it have to be anything special? It's a bar that doesn't exist anymore. It's a bar that... Just like a Christian goes to a church to confess, someone like me or anyone is going to simply have a moment to themselves. Oh and eat very well."
ChIJF23-Q9AvQg0RCSJInce9bBc,4,"Good place... when you manage to catch it open. You have to admit that the chef cooks well... when he cooks. The ceviches, arroz chaufa, and bonito encebollados are pretty good... when you have them. Stone-grilled meat with its secret touch is quite good‚Ä¶ when it has it. And on top of that, the sun shines all year round... when it opens. And that is the problem, and that is why I only give it 4 stars: they open whenever they feel like it, and curiously the days they open do not usually coincide with the calm and sunny days in which we would like to enjoy the terrace, for which is sometimes frustrating to plan a visit to the premises‚Ä¶"
ChIJF23-Q9AvQg0RCSJInce9bBc,5,"Neighborhood bar with excellent food and very good service from its owners. Dish to highlight ‚Äúfish ceviche‚Äù available on Saturdays and Sundays. On the menu, broken eggs with blood sausage and garlic wings. Ask for dishes that are not on the menu and also ask for seafood like the ones in the photos depending on availability."
ChIJF23-Q9AvQg0RCSJInce9bBc,5,"Excellent service. The food is excellent. A varied menu, with conventional dishes, but you can always ask if there is anything off the menu. On weekends the specialty of ceviche that leaves no one indifferent. A very good entrec√¥te (really very good, ask for availability)."
ChIJF23-Q9AvQg0RCSJInce9bBc,5,"The waitress was very funny, the food was very delicious and you had a great time with the terrace. You have a great time, very local."
ChIJF23-Q9AvQg0RCSJInce9bBc,5,Excellent service and very high quality food. I would give it 6 stars and more. Try the cheesecake!!! This is a slow death!!
ChIJDdD9wsYuQg0R8muRIYlfCjo,5,Excellent
ChIJDdD9wsYuQg0R8muRIYlfCjo,5,"It has changed owners and has improved. Very good attention from Silvia, the manager, she is aware that you do not lack anything. Good place to eat some portions. There is paella to order. They give a menu during the week. Large terrace."
ChIJDdD9wsYuQg0R8muRIYlfCjo,5,"Very top. A bar in the Hortaleza neighborhood, which you probably wouldn't notice if someone didn't recommend it to you. I went with the Fork application and I was very surprised.

The portions and half portions are very large and the quality-price ratio is very good. The potato aioli was delicious. The dogfish, which I find very difficult to make due to the flavor of the marinade, was also very good, crunchy and soft at the same time.

The thirds are very cheap too.

We will repeat without a doubt."
ChIJDdD9wsYuQg0R8muRIYlfCjo,4,"We were walking the dogs and we found this bar, we stopped to have something cold in this heat with which the summer that is about to arrive threatens us.... The waiter was very attentive and friendly, the calamari sandwich was also very good, the The only negative detail is that another worker who looked like an owner passed by and without asking permission he pulled up the umbrella without leaving my wife exposed to the sun. We will return for the good service and we will place the missing ‚≠ê star."
ChIJDdD9wsYuQg0R8muRIYlfCjo,2,"We ate on the terrace and it was nice. We asked for a menu, after ordering it they changed the peas with ham for salad, this one had seen the tuna and hard-boiled egg from afar. The second was fried chicken with potatoes, the chicken had almost raw pieces with blood and the fries were acceptable.

Very friendly and attentive service.

The truth is, the experience has not been good and thinking about returning is not very likely."
ChIJxWoT9sYuQg0RPpoXxNYIhYw,5,Ok
ChIJxWoT9sYuQg0RPpoXxNYIhYw,5,"Excellent service, very cool terrace for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Very good letter. Affordable prices. Good customer treatment. Recommended üíØ XüíØ."
ChIJxWoT9sYuQg0RPpoXxNYIhYw,1,"The worst bar in Madrid, the unpleasant owners, arguing with neighbors in front of the customers, the food and the terrible hygiene, I will never go back to that bar."
ChIJxWoT9sYuQg0RPpoXxNYIhYw,1,Bad people and bad environment.
ChIJxWoT9sYuQg0RPpoXxNYIhYw,4,"A good and abundant menu. Don't expect luxury, but pleasant treatment and homemade food"
ChIJ3wThtccuQg0RRIn6NWptwMw,1,They should not have a toilet when clients go out to urinate.
ChIJ3wThtccuQg0RRIn6NWptwMw,5,"Virgilio, Excellent üëå cook, makes a chicharr√≥n that I had not eaten in all of Spain, friendly, pleasant and very polite. The waitress is also not far behind, very helpful and pleasant."
ChIJ3wThtccuQg0RRIn6NWptwMw,5,"My family and I went to drink and eat something, very good service, good food, the waitress was very helpful and attentive, the cook was excellent when serving and the food was exquisite, I highly recommend it"
ChIJ3wThtccuQg0RRIn6NWptwMw,5,"My God my crazy, DIABLOOOOO!!! Piece of chicken, God bless me RD! Even the alpha should eat this jerk ü§£‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•. The staff is even better than the picapollo!"
ChIJ3wThtccuQg0RRIn6NWptwMw,1,"Bad experience in the neighborhood, it was our favorite place to eat when it was called the old one, but now nothing to see, very very dirty kitchen. From the minute we entered, the smell of the place made my stomach turn... we ordered something to try... and the worst mistake was that we didn't like it at all!!  And as soon as I left the premises I had to return to my stomach because I felt so bad."
ChIJb-jFBMguQg0RwPXF-foUQLc,5,"Very good treatment and spectacular omelette. You can order it and take it home.
The noodles and hamburgers are also good but our classic is the potato omelette.
One of those places where the bottles are ice cold and it is a pleasure to have Cheng and Ana serve you so well. Thank you"
ChIJb-jFBMguQg0RwPXF-foUQLc,4,"Neighborhood bar. No terrace. The omelette, excellent.  Asian and Spanish cuisine.  Pleasant."
ChIJb-jFBMguQg0RwPXF-foUQLc,5,"Es un bar regentado por chinos, que dan de comer bien y en abundancia."
ChIJb-jFBMguQg0RwPXF-foUQLc,4,"The homemade rice, Chinese style, is abundant and delicious.
You can also eat a loin sandwich with cheese, depending on your taste and it is also very comfortable, it is quite quiet and the cheapest in the area"
ChIJb-jFBMguQg0RwPXF-foUQLc,5,"A traditional restaurant run by a very friendly Chinese neighbor, Lin. He has delicious Spanish tapas, because he has worked in national restaurants before. Put an appetizer with each drink. Abundant. If you want, you can order rations, although it is better to ask in advance. He just runs the whole place. Always with a smile on his mouth."
ChIJ1-fD8OqHQQ0RRAcqRlAA7f4,1,"No attention to customers. Since they don't have table service you have to go inside to order and pay in advance, and then they give you what they want and they don't resolve the error. Additionally, the treatment is challenging and not very conciliatory. Of course, both my friends and I are not going to set foot in this place. I do not recommend it, it is better to bring your drinks if you go to the club so that you do not get scammed like me."
ChIJ1-fD8OqHQQ0RRAcqRlAA7f4,1,"I give them a one so I can write.
The employees of the Puerta de Hierro sports center, those at the pool kiosk, with zero education and professionalism"
ChIJ1-fD8OqHQQ0RRAcqRlAA7f4,1,It seems that there is a lack of a Manager who clearly organizes the team that serves customers.

ChIJRfUC6OQpQg0Ry6KLAaNFj8A,3,"Played on 6/3/25.  Visitor to Spain and course was recommended to play.
Firstly. If you don‚Äôt speak Spanish. Don‚Äôt play there.  When I attended the tee master shed. I used Google translate to introduce myself and ask to hire a cart.
Man in the box.  Listened to the translation and without looking up from his phone. Pointed towards a tee and said nothing.  I then did the same thing to ask again about a cart. He waved his finger in a No and again pointed to the tee.
I then played the entire round carrying my bag. This course is hilly and demanding to walk.  I am fit for a 61 yr old. But still found myself tiring after about 14 holes.
Course itself is nice layout and fairways and greens are good.  The rest seems to have been let go.  It could be so
Much better.
I gave my rating based on the course. Not one member of staff actually made any effort to speak to me. Even after the round when I tried to get something to eat in the dining room. Not expecting everyone to speak English. I realise I am in Spain.  But common!!!  At least be polite and try to communicate.
Won‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone.  There are some nice holes. But o was too tired to take photos"
ChIJRfUC6OQpQg0Ry6KLAaNFj8A,4,Played 9 - nice course..fairways and greens are in great shape‚Ä¶could maintain course beyond that a bit better.  Tough walking course but do it!  Holes are nicely designed and greens are not very challenging at all but in ideal shape and condition.
ChIJRfUC6OQpQg0Ry6KLAaNFj8A,5,"One of the best courses in Madrid. Prices are reasonable if you have a card, particularly mid week. Driving range is excellent, cheap & includes top tracer. Top quality facilities, restaurant & staff are very helpful. Golf Buggies have GPS mapping for each hole & are reasonably priced. Best to avoid peak times as it can be very busy on weekends & after work."
ChIJRfUC6OQpQg0Ry6KLAaNFj8A,4,"Difficult but nice course, rough is mainly brown earth or brown grass, I know its summer... Very busy on Sunday, driving range and course. Nice clubhouse and dining area."

ChIJBdohkLwpQg0R8bT0fZaeFGw,5,"What a great hidden gem here on the outskirts of the city! While the outside looks unassuming, the inside looks like you've stepped into a bakery from a story book! The prices are very fair, especially for the high quality of the food. Fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious; and the croissants were fluffy and delicate. You can order cakes here, as well pick up some fancy chocolates. They also do lunch and dinner specials; these are usually posted outside the shop in the mornings. I definitely would recommend trying this place."
ChIJBdohkLwpQg0R8bT0fZaeFGw,5,Great brunch options and really friendly staff! Highly recommended
ChIJBdohkLwpQg0R8bT0fZaeFGw,5,The cakes are great
ChIJBdohkLwpQg0R8bT0fZaeFGw,3,"Breakfast here!!!! We are trying the neighborhood breakfasts. Normal place nothing of the
Another world. It has a very nice little terrace when the weather is good. Very good service. Just food, it seems sad to say this about a Pastry Shop... I give it a 3 for the service but I was going to give it a two because the Orange juice doesn't seem natural... and it's ‚Ç¨3"
ChIJBdohkLwpQg0R8bT0fZaeFGw,5,"Extremely nice staff. It's a pleasure to be having breakfast and listen to the enthusiasm and attention with which the rest of the customers are served. Very good coffee, with a lot of foam and the croissant I ordered was very delicious too. out of 10"
ChIJ9ZUXjO8pQg0RBYu2ze8xKM8,5,"Cute little local restaurant. We were served quickly and the prices are fair for the portion sizes. Big TVs to watch the games on, are in ever room. They have a large bar selection, and friendly staff."
ChIJ9ZUXjO8pQg0RBYu2ze8xKM8,1,"I was in El 3 on an evening in the second week in July. I don't know if I was unlucky but I wasn't satisfied at all with either the service or the food. It took more than 15 minutes for the waiter to take our order, another 15 minutes to get the order itself, and when I asked for the check, I ended up going to the bar to pay for it as it was never delivered to me. As for the food, we ordered calamari which were hard. In addition, we got 5 forks for 7 people and had to ask for more, which he brought reluctantly. In summary, a very forgetable experience that unluckily we won't be able to forget."
ChIJ9ZUXjO8pQg0RBYu2ze8xKM8,5,Great burgers and a super atmosphere with great service.

Very good atmosphere"
ChIJ68y8ubspQg0RzCx5ZUWLRSM,5,"The best discovery in the neighborhood.  Good atmosphere; good Spanish music from the 80s and 90s. Great food where the quality is evident. In particular, we really liked the torreznos, the oxtail, the entrails and the chocolate coulant. It also has gluten-free options. They let you go with dogs, like ours, all very polite, you don't even notice they are there. Super friendly service, fast, attentive. They have invited us to several shots of vermouth that we wanted to try. In short, a place that deserves to do well."

ChIJyxsfje8pQg0RrMxK0iizKBs,5,"SUPER RECOMMENDED, WITHOUT A DOUBT WE WILL REPEAT; THE FOOD WAS FABULOUS, THE OWNER ANTONIO VERY ATTENTIVE, AND THE WAITER IN THE LOUNGE ALSO VERY PROFESSIONAL. WE ATE THE SPECIAL WEEKEND MENU FOR ‚Ç¨35, IBERIAN HAM CUT WITH A KNIFE, SOME HOMEMADE CROQUETTES, BELLY WITH TOMATO, ROQUEFORT SINGLE MEDALLIONS, AND ENTRECOT BETWEEN 800 GRAMS AND 1 KG WEIGHT EACH + DRINKS + DESSERTS VARIED, AND NONE OF US WERE ABLE TO EAT ALL THE FOOD THEY PUT US...

ChIJyxsfje8pQg0RrMxK0iizKBs,1,"My experience at ""Los Granadinos 3"" was, without a doubt, one of the worst I have had in a restaurant. From the moment I walked in, I could tell something wasn't right. The food was of poor quality, with a flavor that left much to be desired. The prices, on the other hand, were excessively high for what they offered, which seemed like a real abuse to me.

The attention of the waiters was another negative point. It was rude and unpleasant, like they didn't care at all about the customer experience. However, after observing the owner's treatment of them, I could understand why his attitude was so bad. The owner was rude and dismissive of his staff, which was clearly reflected in the poor service I received. It is evident that a bad work environment directly affects the treatment of clients.

To make matters worse, the hygiene of the place left a lot to be desired. On the bar, next to the appetizers, I found several dead cockroaches. This made me think that the restaurant has a serious pest problem, which is completely unacceptable in an establishment that serves food. It wasn't just one cockroach, but several, which made me question the sanitary conditions of the place.

In short, I would not recommend ""Los Granadinos 3"" to anyone. The combination of bad food, high prices, terrible service and hygiene problems make this experience something I do not want to repeat. I definitely won't be back."
ChIJyxsfje8pQg0RrMxK0iizKBs,3,"The weekend menu for ‚Ç¨25 is more of a daily menu for ‚Ç¨15, the name of the dishes is very pompous but the cuisine is very regular, the sirloin thin as a slice of ham, the beans with clams come with two clams, rice with battle lobster and so on. They include a glass of wine or a beer on the menu, totally insufficient to eat. Quite disappointing."
ChIJVbHRdvspQg0RnMWkfORAGAU,5,"Absolutely delicious. Fantastic food beautiful presentation. You can tell that the chef really cares and wants to please the customers. Of course breath taking views of the ‚õ≥ course. For starters we ordered the croquettes, viera, chipirones and provolette and for main we shared a melt in your mouth beef rib with chips. Everything including drinks was a mind blowing 35‚Ç¨ per person. Probably the most reasonable for the quality I have had in Madrid. Definitely going back!"
ChIJVbHRdvspQg0RnMWkfORAGAU,5,"The ambiance was elegant, the food was absolutely delicious, beautifully presented, and full of flavor.
Service was outstanding, with special thanks to our waiter, Carlos, who was truly exceptional! Attentive, professional, and genuinely warm.
He made us feel completely at ease, taking the time to chat with us and explain the menu in Italian, which was incredibly helpful since we speak little Spanish. His hospitality made our experience even more enjoyable."
ChIJVbHRdvspQg0RnMWkfORAGAU,4,"The food itself is nothing outstanding, in fact the place is quite expensive for what you get food wise. The reason why people come here is because of either convenience after finishing a golf session or because of the views, which are very pretty. In the end, we came out to 35‚Ç¨ pp. Overall I would recommend, just know that if what you're looking for is strictly the best quality for your money, this is not the place for you."
ChIJVbHRdvspQg0RnMWkfORAGAU,3,A great spot to relax with good views of the course. You'll need to be relaxed as the service can need pretty irregular.
ChIJVbHRdvspQg0RnMWkfORAGAU,4,Had a nice cocktail party. Good atmosphere and good food.
ChIJh1nvw-4pQg0R7bChktvUchs,4,"Nice food and friendly service but there was a very large group of rowdy teenagers nearby, probably too young to be drinking, who spoiled the atmosphere."
ChIJh1nvw-4pQg0R7bChktvUchs,4,"Corner bar with a sizeable patio run by a friendly Chinese couple. If their tortilla is anything to go by, tapas are good."

ChIJWXCLLu0pQg0Rgepcvf7_ueA,5,Great meat!!! Food is of a good quality and represents a Classic argentinian meat Eatery. Even desserts and fun and delicious! They really know how too cook good meat! I totally recommend and will be back myslelf!
ChIJWXCLLu0pQg0Rgepcvf7_ueA,5,"Anderson served us. He's the Brazilian waiter and was extremely kind, helpful and accommodating.

The food was incredibly delicious and the Argentinina football atmosphere and ambience was spectacular!

It's just a little smal but we'll definitely come back.

Thank you."
ChIJWXCLLu0pQg0Rgepcvf7_ueA,5,"I heard about this restaurant literally 20 years ago, when I lived near and I was broke. At that time what I heard was: 'it is the best restaurant of the hood'
Nearly 15 years later I settled for a living near the place again (by chance I guess) and with a radical financial different situation. I dropped by chance, honestly, but remembered clearly the words I heard 20 years before: the best restaurant of the hood. And not surprisingly, it is!! Amazing place, it truly feels like a lost piece of Buenos Aires in the middle of Madrid. The service super attentive, the food great, the ambience amazing, the price fair. They even have live music
It is a 10 stars, not a 5
Well done team, for many more years"
ChIJWXCLLu0pQg0Rgepcvf7_ueA,5,A classic place from this neighborhood! If you want great quality meat and to feel like you are in the middle of Buenos Aires you must come here. Big wine variety from different Argentinian choices and Spanish ones. Service is excellent. Don‚Äôt forget to try the desserts and to visit the Men‚Äôs toilet!!!
ChIJWXCLLu0pQg0Rgepcvf7_ueA,5,"From the moment I walked into El Almac√©n de Buenos Aires, I was enveloped by an ambiance that expertly blends the vibrant spirit of Argentina with the sophistication of Madrid. The decor is a standout, striking a perfect balance between rustic charm and contemporary elegance, with incredible tributes to Argentine icons like Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. These thoughtful decorations not only celebrate football greatness but also ignite conversations and admiration among diners.

The soundscape of the restaurant adds to its allure, with a carefully curated selection of music that transports you from the bustling streets of Madrid to the lively neighborhoods of Buenos Aires. Whether it‚Äôs the soulful strums of a guitar or the rhythmic beats of a tango, the atmosphere at El Almac√©n is always buzzing with energy and charm.

The menu is a delightful journey through Argentine cuisine, with each dish showcasing robust flavors and impeccable presentation. The standout for me was definitely the grilled meats; they were cooked to perfection, offering a taste that can only be described as transporting you straight to Argentina.

A special mention must go to Tomas, whose service was exceptional. He was attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable, and truly enhanced our dining experience with his recommendations and insights into the food and wine pairings.

El Almac√©n de Buenos Aires is more than just a restaurant; it's a culinary and cultural adventure that I would recommend to anyone looking for high-quality Argentine food in a captivating setting. Whether you're a local or a tourist, make sure to stop by and let Tomas guide you through a fantastic dining experience. You won't be disappointed!"
ChIJxZgE_ZIpQg0R5fH0JvGFhjo,5,"Best thing about here is the staff. The food is good and everything is reasonably priced. The vibe is also good, always just busy enough to give it a good atmosphere. Great for the Budget travelers."
ChIJxZgE_ZIpQg0R5fH0JvGFhjo,3,"Wonderful and reasonably priced food, specially my Asturian Cachopo üëå
It has Estrella Galicia, the best commercial beer in Spain.
However mi vegetarian companion wasn't too happy about the veggie options and her Tiramis√∫ did not look too homemade and wasn't that tasty."
ChIJxZgE_ZIpQg0R5fH0JvGFhjo,5,"It is very good local bar. I have ordered a tortilla and it was delicious. I would like to add that they have an English version of the menu.
Este es un buen restaurante local y tiene una version en ingles del menu e ordenado una tortilla y me parece deliciosa."

ChIJX0vxlOwpQg0RB_JpZ-FAq4Q,4,"Normal Asian food restaurant. It looks like it's mainly takeout. There isn't much decoration but it has some little rooms that you can go through and sit on the floor and they are private. The food was all good, and well priced."
ChIJX0vxlOwpQg0RB_JpZ-FAq4Q,5,"Excellent kubak, very fresh tofu and very well made noodles. Very friendly and very well priced. Recommended without a doubt."
ChIJUbTElewpQg0R2v1LR1fb6_0,5,"Restaurant on the edge of Herrera Oria, with nothing that initially attracts attention: one more of the many terraces in Madrid. However, it hides a cuisine with a sufficiently extensive and good quality menu. It's the second time I've been to the place, and it surprised me again. On this occasion, we ordered several dishes to share: pepper and belly salad, grilled vegetables with goat cheese (just right), chicken curry, golden cod (these last two, dishes that we repeated from the last occasion) and broken eggs with eels and shrimp. And when it seems that you have enjoyed a great meal, the final surprise: an apple pie, a house specialty, that breaks the mold. One of those times when it is essential to order dessert.
All at a very reasonable price and very friendly service."
ChIJUbTElewpQg0R2v1LR1fb6_0,5,"A simple place with quality food.
We ordered a series of dishes to share, among which we would undoubtedly highlight the grilled vegetables (very delicious and without excess oil), the belly salad with green tomatoes and piquillo peppers (with a large amount of belly that was really good) and golden cod (served boldly in the form of an omelet).
In addition, the apple pie for dessert is the best I have ever had, very different from any other I have eaten before and a 10."

ChIJUbTElewpQg0R2v1LR1fb6_0,4,"All the food was delicious: the nachos, hamburgers, scallops, meats...and some amazing desserts. The service was super good, the waiters were very nice. I don't give it 5 stars because a portion of croquettes came out frozen inside. Advisable."
ChIJJW-BLpMpQg0RW66SeUA1PZA,5,A family restaurant serving food from the Astorias region of North Spain. A very happy family atmosphere plus you can watch Spanish football. Okay by me.  Paul from London Egg and chips !!

ChIJr1w4mpMpQg0RPUHyft5vHAA,5,"If you are looking for a quality product with good preparation, this is your place. But also excellent service and good price. √Ålvaro and ""the Galician"" took care of us and made us feel at home. Highly recommended."
ChIJr1w4mpMpQg0RPUHyft5vHAA,4,"Small seafood restaurant in the Barrio del Pilar area, we didn't know it and we went on Saturday to have something to eat. They have a good variety and the rods are very well drawn in the old style in Madrid. We ordered some anchovies in vinegar, very tasty and large, and a fried fish, which indicated that it is for two people and cumin for all three, very tasty too. It is true that the prices are higher than the average of the neighborhood establishments but there are things you have to pay for."
ChIJr1w4mpMpQg0RPUHyft5vHAA,4,"A seafood place in the area with friendly waiters is appreciated. We only ordered scallops, which were not bad in price but arrived a little cold. I think it was something specific"
ChIJr1w4mpMpQg0RPUHyft5vHAA,5,"December 2016:
It seems like a siege to me. Neighborhood restaurant but with quality. Excellent sea bass and meat. Generous portions. Really attentive lifelong waiters. I will return for sure.
Of course, parking in the area is very complicated."
ChIJr1w4mpMpQg0RPUHyft5vHAA,5,"Brutally good, fresh, quality products and unbeatable service. 1000x1000 recommendable, without a doubt we will repeat.
Captains, it is an honor to eat at your house."
ChIJS3fpD-4pQg0Rrbooy8P6Ln4,5,"The first of the restaurants that Jes√∫s has opened in Madrid. On Amadeo G√≥mez Street, next to Cardenal Herrera Oria (the beach road), it is a medium-sized establishment with a terrace under a very pleasant arcade. The service is always attentive although not always the fastest, but it is compensated with homemade food that is usually quite high quality. The quantities are quite respectable and the price is quite contained."
ChIJS3fpD-4pQg0Rrbooy8P6Ln4,5,"Everything was delicious and especially the paellas, I highly recommend"

ChIJtS2jQsEpQg0RMqxEOziid7s,5,"We visit  Madrid Last sept. 7, 2019 from U.S. and  we dine at the pizza restaurant. The pizza is so delicious and the crust is so thin . I was really impress how they served the pizza in Madrid  with 3 kinds and its long and so yummy. Thanks to the chef Joveniel who cook us the pizza and to all the staff for the good service. It was unforgettable experience for me ."
ChIJtS2jQsEpQg0RMqxEOziid7s,5,"Had an amazing experience. The pizzas have a great size, it tastes like they actually want you to orgasm, and the staff is very pleasant and welcoming. I highly recommend this restaurant"

Cheese cake was delicious, thank you!"
ChIJ32FfOhYpQg0RP6UVBvmK41o,5,"Very good place, very good atmosphere.
One of the best kebaps I've ever tried and a very good price.

It shows that the products are natural. The yogurt sauce is very good

10 out of 10, highly recommended, I will return"
ChIJ32FfOhYpQg0RP6UVBvmK41o,5,"Everything is very good indeed. The owner is very nice and very close.
The durum is good too, it has a very good flavor and the potatoes are great.
Definitely highly recommended."
ChIJ32FfOhYpQg0RP6UVBvmK41o,5,"The owner is one of the horniest people there is, he is a nice guy like himself and very smart, the kebab is amazing (and not because it makes you feel bad) clean and the sauces are homemade, we will repeat, trustworthy kebab üëçüëç the whole neighborhood apparently knows him and he is very close with the kids."
ChIJ32FfOhYpQg0RP6UVBvmK41o,5,"The quality of the food is great, the best kebab in the neighborhood. It shows that it is homemade and natural.
Very nice atmosphere."
ChIJ32FfOhYpQg0RP6UVBvmK41o,5,"Nabil is always super nice, I train right above the premises and he not only has incredible treatment when I come to the premises but also when he sees me on a daily basis.

Plus, of course, the food is delicious and at a super good price!"
ChIJd9TkehwpQg0RcXnY4aTszus,5,"Unbeatable!! The portions are huge and very delicious! Incredible service, as well as nice, helpful and fast. Felipe is charming and it is a pleasure to see him always with a smile!

My recommendations are the super portion of broken eggs with ham, the chicken volandrines and the super Del Estal sandwich.

A 10 for this place!!"
ChIJd9TkehwpQg0RcXnY4aTszus,5,"The first thing I would highlight is the attention of the staff without a doubt (thanks Felipe!), but the quality of their dishes is not far behind, as well as the presentation and their deliciousness (we ordered tomato with entresca and the meat grilled on the stone).

It is not a super elegant and romantic restaurant, more of a typical neighborhood restaurant, but it is very worth it for its quality-price ratio and for everything mentioned above. It's where you find professionals who know how to make you feel good. Well no, very good!

Thanks great team, we will be back!!!!"
ChIJd9TkehwpQg0RcXnY4aTszus,5,"Como leo es un restaurante de barrio, claro que s√≠, es donde est√°. La diferencia la pone Marcos, su mujer y sus camareros, trat√°ndote con cercan√≠a, sirvi√©ndote r√°pido a pesar de que est√© el restaurante lleno de gente.

He ido muchas veces a Del Estal y ser√° porque me siento como en casa, puedo disfrutar con mi familia o amigos mientras me dan un servicio inmejorable. Y seguir√© yendo muchas veces m√°s para disfrutar de sus amplias raciones y de sus estupendos platos."
ChIJd9TkehwpQg0RcXnY4aTszus,5,"The charming owners, we arrived very late to eat. They have treated us phenomenally, very pleasant. They already had the kitchen closed and they opened it to make us a burger that was extraordinary. It's nice to have people who want to work and do things well! Thank you so much!"
ChIJd9TkehwpQg0RcXnY4aTszus,5,"The best place to have a good time, the broken eggs are wonderful, the owners and waiters are friendly people, it's a pleasure to come and go.
Thank you for your attention and good service!! üòÉ recommended üíØ"
ChIJsyv0tNApQg0R7ipd9wgS7I8,5,"Fran is a true ham expert. Each piece is carefully selected, ensuring the best product and excellent flavor. The slicing is impeccable, and the vacuum packaging guarantees that the ham arrives fresh and delicious. You can see the care and attention in every detail. He also offers ham slicing services at events, adding a special touch that your guests will appreciate. Highly recommended!"
ChIJsyv0tNApQg0R7ipd9wgS7I8,5,"Word of mouth works. I was looking for a quality product at a reasonable price for a gift and they told me about Fran. I contacted him, I went to meet him and he was talking to me about the product he sells. I met a simple, serious and professional person. I ordered several prepared products, Iberian ham, salchich√≥n and chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãsliced ‚Äã‚Äãand vacuum packed, accompanied by a bottle of cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil. Without a doubt, the gifts were successful and Fran has won me over as an unconditional customer."
ChIJsyv0tNApQg0R7ipd9wgS7I8,5,"In some published photo I saw that he also sells EVOO extra virgin olive oil and I asked him. He offered to take me to try the first-pressed early picual oil.
‚≠ê SPECTACULAR!!! ‚≠ê
For a gift it is ideal. And in every salad or toast that person will remember you."
ChIJsyv0tNApQg0R7ipd9wgS7I8,5,Both the product and the treatment that Fran offers are 10!! 100% recommended! Very good ham brought directly from Extremadura. Thank you very much Fran!
ChIJsyv0tNApQg0R7ipd9wgS7I8,5,It's extraordinary and it's great service. The knives used are of great quality and the smiles are on the surface.
ChIJ8x8AR5MpQg0RoHlseHZvsHk,5,"I went for the first time to celebrate Father's Day and I left very satisfied. The ham croquettes were very good, the shrimp salad was exquisite and the rice dishes, which were served to us, were also very good. Very friendly and attentive staff.
I remember the name Saray, lovely."
ChIJ8x8AR5MpQg0RoHlseHZvsHk,2,"Battle rice: Se√±oret with frozen seafood and coloring, very basic and expensive for what it is (see photo), ‚Ç¨20 per person. The croquettes were very delicious but very small and they only had one type (cabrales). The artichokes are passable (note that they have garlic and generally never have it, for those who cannot tolerate it). It's not worth going for 3 people for ‚Ç¨120, sorry."
ChIJ8x8AR5MpQg0RoHlseHZvsHk,5,"I ordered a mixed paella to take away and the service was correct and friendly both the day I went to order it and when I picked it up and returned the paella pan.

I had a vermouth with their pincho when we went for the paella and as for it... Good flavor and quantity.

We will repeat, a success"
ChIJ8x8AR5MpQg0RoHlseHZvsHk,1,"Bad experience.

They didn't have half of the things we wanted to order initially, the croquettes we ordered didn't look like the ones they served us, the pepper salad with belly belly was basically a can of the first on a can of the second on top of a leaf of lettuce, the rice we ordered was not the one they served us, but since it took an hour and a half to serve us the rice we did not want to return it to the kitchen (it was not the one from other tables either), the table next to us was He left without eating after waiting an hour and a half and seeing in the kitchen that his rice was not even cooking, very confused when it came to taking orders and serving, the rice was too salty, ... and I'm sure I'll forget things.

We will not repeat."
ChIJ8x8AR5MpQg0RoHlseHZvsHk,5,"A discovery in the neighborhood! Cold and well-drafted beer, good tapas, the spectacular pipirrana, I haven't had it so good in centuries, the potato and chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãstew is delicious, the homemade and very delicious croquettes, and the amazing rice that we were looking forward to trying, very very good Exquisite service and attention. Good news for the neighborhood!"
ChIJ8S3iIZMpQg0R8ENsTlSChO4,5,"One of the best bars in Madrid, exquisite appetizers, super careful and exceptional service. Without a doubt to repeat"
ChIJ8S3iIZMpQg0R8ENsTlSChO4,5,"Great tapas in a very nice place.
The staff is very nice."
ChIJ8S3iIZMpQg0R8ENsTlSChO4,5,"The best atmosphere, the best cook Carmen and the best host Julio! Quite a discovery"
ChIJ8S3iIZMpQg0R8ENsTlSChO4,5,"The best bar.

Don't expect modernity, but Julio has a hand and the hamburgers, tripe, porridge, lamb and rice are from another galaxy. Always cold beers. It's one of those endangered backwaters that you pray never disappear."
ChIJ8S3iIZMpQg0R8ENsTlSChO4,5,"I'm from outside Madrid, but whenever I can I go to Julio's bar. The treatment is more than good and being there is another world. More than recommended!"
ChIJT2xLGJMpQg0REieC6xlhcIo,5,
ChIJdcfsCccpQg0Rx8Ouoq-tYpk,5,I'm happy that I discovered this place for lunch. Great lunch menue.
ChIJdcfsCccpQg0Rx8Ouoq-tYpk,5,The best potato omelette with chorizo ‚Äã‚ÄãI have ever tried. Juan is a charm and not to mention Fernando anymore. The nicest and friendliest people in the neighborhood. We will return without hesitation. P.s: The tortilla with chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãwas made for us upon request and it is delicious! Thanks for everything!
ChIJdcfsCccpQg0Rx8Ouoq-tYpk,5,"Wonderful treatment and wonderful food, the best portion of secret that I have eaten in years.
101% recommendable"
ChIJdcfsCccpQg0Rx8Ouoq-tYpk,5,"A good friend had told me about this restaurant, both because of the good cuisine and because of the hospitality of the owners. I was eating yesterday with my partner and my family, and I can corroborate the recommendation he made to me. I'm vegan, and he made me a menu just for me that was delicious, and I know the rest were delighted.
The treatment of both Fernando and his wife was very close. A 100% recommended site that will leave no one indifferent üëåüëåüëå."
ChIJdcfsCccpQg0Rx8Ouoq-tYpk,1,"Unpleasant flavor and texture.
A bad joke from the beginning.
I ask for wine with homemade and instead of bringing me the typical bottle of wine with its homemade, the crazy guy goes and brings me a meaningless mini carafe that empties just by looking at it.
The owner/waiter deigns to bring me another mini carafe, bordering on thrifty pathos.
First I order a black pudding lasagna.
When I tell you that the black pudding was the leftover stew from the other day with a tranchete on top and mixed scrambled with leek, leaving the stomach as ruined as if they had added sulfuric acid to it due to its grimy texture and its insipid flavor bordering on the diner's insanity.

And then second chicken cordon bleu.
My mother.
The cook should never have separated himself from the umbilical cord so as not to make those meals, insulting the intelligence of the palate.
Imagine kids.
Breaded chicken tempered from the Alcampo dedaco brand on top half burnt.
I don't know why there are so many positive reviews when it is the worst place and look, there are bad places to eat in the Pilar neighborhood.
Flee while you can fools from that place"
ChIJWx7KdZMpQg0Ro-Y_at01vz4,2,"I think we didn't go at the right time, it was 2:45 p.m. and it was empty, everything was very normal, going downhill, I will repeat another day, but at an hour later... high morale"
ChIJWx7KdZMpQg0Ro-Y_at01vz4,5,"Buen sitio para tapear, como dice el nombre,  personal cercano y amable."
ChIJWx7KdZMpQg0Ro-Y_at01vz4,5,"The best bar in all of Spain, at least in the cities I had the pleasure of visiting. The service received was exceptional and the food was simply delicious. I have an unforgettable memory and I am looking forward to returning to Madrid with great enthusiasm."
ChIJWx7KdZMpQg0Ro-Y_at01vz4,5,"Typical neighborhood place that does not leave you indifferent. Where the prices are very good and you will always have some tapas accompanying your drink.
It also has paid sports, so you can watch your game, motorcycles or cars in peace.
Even if it's just you have to stop by and get to know it."
ChIJWx7KdZMpQg0Ro-Y_at01vz4,5,A 10! Good tapas and the owner very friendly.
ChIJ_5P-nZMpQg0REP7DMYei_pY,4,"We arrived at a time of oversaturation of customers and overbooking of rations due to it being the late hours of Sunday. However, the service guy served us on the terrace as quickly as he could and presented us with alternative portions for celiacs. All of this with friendliness and good humor that invited you to enjoy the moment.
However, the price seemed a little high to me. I guess because it is a terrace..."
ChIJ_5P-nZMpQg0REP7DMYei_pY,5,"Place where they never fail you, especially Friday dinner. Seasonal vegetables, excellent meats and fish as well as a yogurt that they make and of course without forgetting the waiters Salam and Vicente, be careful that I did not forget the cooking, a fundamental part of good work."
ChIJ_5P-nZMpQg0REP7DMYei_pY,5,"Very good food, excellent service, incredible menu, I definitely recommend it and I will return more times when I am in this area."
ChIJ_5P-nZMpQg0REP7DMYei_pY,5,"A homely, homely, beautiful, pleasant restaurant and very well attended by Sadan. Family of 5 members, we have eaten, traditional food, very well and delicately served, good price for families and with very good customer service. To repeat."
ChIJ_5P-nZMpQg0REP7DMYei_pY,5,"Today I had lunch there, good appetizers I ate ear in spectacular sauce good cook ra"
ChIJuU0E95IpQg0RYPITOD03bNc,4,This restaurant is a family restaurant with good employees and normal food
ChIJuU0E95IpQg0RYPITOD03bNc,5,Ok
ChIJuU0E95IpQg0RYPITOD03bNc,5,Top
ChIJuU0E95IpQg0RYPITOD03bNc,5,"The best bar in the city, very cold beer, good service and spectacular service."
ChIJuU0E95IpQg0RYPITOD03bNc,4,"Five friends had lunch, five calamari sandwiches and everything was great. The tortilla is very good. Deceives on the outside."
ChIJb8JGMOUpQg0Rtb8XQ4sv_Cw,5,"My partner and I went on a Sunday morning, the place was very clean and tidy. The attention was very good from all the waiters and we loved both the food and drinks. Especially the chicken strips and their accompanying sauce.
We will definitely return to try more of the menu."
ChIJb8JGMOUpQg0Rtb8XQ4sv_Cw,5,Beaucoup de plats tr√®s bons. Muy bueno
ChIJb8JGMOUpQg0Rtb8XQ4sv_Cw,5,"Everything is very delicious, the attention of the waiters and a varied menu stand out, I always come back since I work next door, Leonardo is a cracker and always has the best recommendation!"
ChIJb8JGMOUpQg0Rtb8XQ4sv_Cw,5,"We eat here almost every day and the service is great. I make special mention of Leonardo, who is a true professional."
ChIJb8JGMOUpQg0Rtb8XQ4sv_Cw,5,Today I went with my husband and we sat down to have some red wines and some chicken strips and the truth is 10/10 the strips were super crispy and the service was very attentive
ChIJ75ufOI0pQg0RngdHrspnjtI,4,"The marinade of the bienmesabe was a little too strong for our liking, the rest were pretty good. Waiters were nice and the environment is chill."
ChIJ75ufOI0pQg0RngdHrspnjtI,5,Very well run bar with reasonable prices & friendly atmosphere... generous raciones for eating or ok for just drinking.. spacious terrace outside for smokers
ChIJ75ufOI0pQg0RngdHrspnjtI,5,Very friendly staff. Good price!
ChIJ75ufOI0pQg0RngdHrspnjtI,3,Ok
ChIJ75ufOI0pQg0RngdHrspnjtI,1,"After having been there several times, eating and having an aperitif, we thought it was a pretty good place. Today, while having some beers, a waiter serves us twice, by the way, he repeats the appetizer, I give him money to pay ‚Ç¨20, he brings us back, by the way, the drinks have increased a lot. We ended up turning around and got up, after a while the waiter came running down the street saying that we had left without paying, we told him that it wasn't true, we clarified that he was the one who charged us and then he told us that he was very busy and didn't remember, I told him that if he continued he was going to call the police, he told us no that he didn't clarify, he left and didn't apologize to us, which is why they have lost several clients from friends and family."
ChIJ7bsVmZMpQg0RYLyDNU-4hQM,5,"Small place but very nice and with a lot of variety, the man who served us was super friendly, patient and helped us choose a couple of wines to give as gifts that we really liked even though we didn't know anything about wine!
They have both to drink and to buy the bottle.
Very quiet, everything well organized and I won't talk about prices because I don't know but I didn't think it was expensive at all.
He gave us the wines in a well-protected cardboard box. 10/10"
ChIJ7bsVmZMpQg0RYLyDNU-4hQM,5,"Nice place. Good professional, value for money, exceptional, very busy with friendly and polite public. In short, a place worth visiting üòä"
ChIJ7bsVmZMpQg0RYLyDNU-4hQM,5,"It brings together all the charm of the neighborhood and the aroma of a town, but with the variety of a large area.
Attention and prices of 10"
ChIJ7bsVmZMpQg0RYLyDNU-4hQM,5,"Cozy and super nice place, the owner may be one of the people who knows the most about wine I have ever met! Recommended without a doubt."
ChIJ7bsVmZMpQg0RYLyDNU-4hQM,5,"Valent√≠n is a great expert on the subject. It is a luxury to have a place like
Sanz winery in the area. A 10 in customer service and products."
ChIJYQTHto0pQg0R02Rq7f1PrnE,5,Excellent quality:price ratio. Friendly staff. Love the quiet terrace under the trees.
ChIJYQTHto0pQg0R02Rq7f1PrnE,4,"Great terrace and abundant reactions, I thought the cuttlefish was good, the shots were somewhat oily, the salad was very decent, the waiters are very attentive and friendly, they have good staff, the prices are not high, the food is not wonderful, but it is according to the size of the portion and the price you pay"
ChIJYQTHto0pQg0R02Rq7f1PrnE,4,"Restaurant where its strength is the terrace, located on a pedestrian street that connects two other streets, it is a pleasant and usually cool place to enjoy a meal, coffee or have a drink. Their food is quite irregular, some dishes are spectacular but others are quite normal. Normal menu and √† la carte price. The waiters are not the fastest or friendliest but acceptable."
ChIJYQTHto0pQg0R02Rq7f1PrnE,1,"For an average white wine, 3.20 euros with a pitiful aperitif. Neither the quality of the wine nor the establishment justify this price. In other establishments, of much better category, the same wine does not cost three euros. Neither my gang friends nor I will appear there again."
ChIJYQTHto0pQg0R02Rq7f1PrnE,1,"We had a reservation at 2:15 so we went to have a drink on the terrace at 1:00, they sat us at the tables where the sun was the most and the place was almost empty, then it took them 30 minutes to serve us, they left us It's 1:30 and then another 15 minutes passed until the drinks were brought. Also, they didn't bring us skewers with 9 people at the table...

Then at lunch time the place was very cozy but the dishes had a lot to be desired, the only decent one was a salad that was really good, the rest of the dishes were very mediocre. Furthermore, the waiters were rude to us and without any kind of cordial treatment. They even complained that we were traveling with a little girl and she was looking at her cell phone (with no sound of course).

We also ordered the menu of the day and it came out to ‚Ç¨17.5 each, a very exaggerated price which, with all the rest, has made me never want to return EVER AGAIN.

I don't know I absolutely recommend it to ANYONE."
ChIJBW8_nKMpQg0Rk9TqOZPhnNY,5,"Real homemade food at PUXEIRO DE LAS MEIGAS cooked on the day. We have already tried the chicken (it flew before I could take a photo!), croquettes, omelette, chicken fingers, peppers, cod fritters and Ali oli potatoes... All delicious. You can see the experience and love in each dish. Carefully selected ingredients and very competitive prices. We will repeat without a doubt."
ChIJBW8_nKMpQg0Rk9TqOZPhnNY,5,"An incredible place, special treatment and very friendly.
As for the food, it has chicken, croquettes, and chocolate cake and it is incredible. You can tell that it is fresh and everything is homemade. 100x100 recommended. I will return I love it"
ChIJBW8_nKMpQg0Rk9TqOZPhnNY,5,"Estaba todo riqu√≠simo, nos hemos llevado 2 tortillas,croquetas,chorizos a la sidra,pimientos rellenos, cachopo. El trato s√∫per bien, adem√°s mientas esper√°bamos nos dieron a probar unas patatas revolconas riqu√≠simas. Son muy agradables, lo recomiendo 100%. Gracias"
ChIJBW8_nKMpQg0Rk9TqOZPhnNY,5,"Sitio reci√©n abierto de comidas preparadas. Pollos asados, platos de cuchara, ensaladillas fr√≠as, croquetas, dulces... de todo! Hemos probado la tortilla y estaba excelente. Buen lugar si se te ha olvidado hacer la comida, o simplemente te apetece comer bien en casa!"
ChIJBW8_nKMpQg0Rk9TqOZPhnNY,5,Lovely people. Many possibilities for gluten-free food to take away. The chickens are very good.
ChIJl7wYU-4pQg0RC2BrwukbuF0,5,"The best place to go and enjoy a drink or good food they have, there it's a very nice atmosphere  and good quality of the products, I wish to leave 10 STAR but I'm allowed 5 , thank you guys for your treat!!!"
ChIJl7wYU-4pQg0RC2BrwukbuF0,5,This was a great find in Madrid. The hamburger was huge and cooked to perfection. The waitor was very nice
ChIJl7wYU-4pQg0RC2BrwukbuF0,5,Awesome burgers and very nice staff! Hidden gem for sure.
ChIJl7wYU-4pQg0RC2BrwukbuF0,5,"The best restaurant ever. Congratulations to the chef who makes exquisite food. Made always gives us excellent service. They are always very careful with allergens, that's why we always go with confidence."
ChIJl7wYU-4pQg0RC2BrwukbuF0,5,"Tremendous menu of the day!!! Great rice and chicken, with coffee and dessert included, the service is great, I only ate there and I will surely return when I am in the area."
ChIJv-o8kpMpQg0Re8XDIsi4KxU,5,"A typical bar-restaurant where good service, delicious food and the feeling of eating at home prevail."
ChIJv-o8kpMpQg0Re8XDIsi4KxU,3,"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
Both the girl and the man who serve are quite rude, it seems like they are doing you a favor by letting you sit down and have a few beers.  They answer in a bad manner, they don't go on to ask if you want another round, to pay they take more than 20 minutes to bring the bill (and on top of that with errors).
This bar is lucky enough to have a fairly large terrace next to green areas, so the terrace is filled simply for that reason, but if we talk about customer service, as I have already said, it leaves a lot to be desired.
Likewise, they put beers with lemon not too cold, and if you ask if they have a cold bottle they rudely answer that it is in the refrigerator... a refrigerator at a low temperature is not the same as a refrigerator at 18 degrees. Also, are bad manners necessary? I think there are plenty...
I would love for them to improve the service, because the location and the terrace of the bar are very good."
ChIJv-o8kpMpQg0Re8XDIsi4KxU,4,"One of the few bars in the area where on Champions League day, they don't just show the Madrid game. Additionally, there is a park next door, where if you go with kids, they can play, while parents can watch them from the terrace.
They have good tapas, and other wildcard types if you are not a regular at this bar."
ChIJv-o8kpMpQg0Re8XDIsi4KxU,1,A shame to waste the terrace it has like this. Bad service. He told us that he couldn't make us sandwiches because he didn't have bread (group of 8 people) with a supermarket in front of us. ‚Ç¨8 of bravas that are frozen and cold. There is no possibility of two sauces. A few people who could have been regulars won't be back
ChIJv-o8kpMpQg0Re8XDIsi4KxU,5,"They make a crispy grilled ear that is exceptional, and the marinated dogfish is enough. Advisable"
ChIJP5jCEpQpQg0RBzpXhE99vfY,4,"Good burgers, large size, at an excellent price."
ChIJP5jCEpQpQg0RBzpXhE99vfY,1,
ChIJIbqjNZIpQg0RKQvketq-N7U,5,"I met him working in the area.  The treatment was spectacular, there was a 3x2 promo on the beer, the appetizers were delicious and very well cared for and the girl is super friendly
I loved the family atmosphere and from the first day I came while I was working in the area
I recommend it 100 percent!!!!"
ChIJIbqjNZIpQg0RKQvketq-N7U,5,"Variable appetizers. Very friendly and pleasant waitress. Small, family-friendly neighborhood bar. Very delicious omelet and ear!!!"
ChIJIbqjNZIpQg0RKQvketq-N7U,5,There is a good neighborhood atmosphere and those who come with good vibes also have affordable prices and on Fridays there is a lot of going.
ChIJIbqjNZIpQg0RKQvketq-N7U,5,"Good atmosphere, good prices and lovely waitress, I recommend trying the tortilla skewer üòãüòã
I will be back!!!!!"
ChIJIbqjNZIpQg0RKQvketq-N7U,5,"Great service, variety of snacks and family atmosphere. economical price"
ChIJvbJaXwApQg0RIdMsjwR2Dbo,5,"Very good treatment from both Cipri and Jos√©. Good atmosphere, careful treatment of the customer and spectacular product. The tomato salad is absolutely crazy, the steak has an incredible grilled flavor. It is well worth coming, congratulations for the attention and service. We will repeat soon"
ChIJvbJaXwApQg0RIdMsjwR2Dbo,5,"Without a doubt a great success. We went because of the reviews and the expectation even improved! The selection of wines, vermouths and beers is amazing, great quality and excellence! I recommend the Spanish Se√±orito vermouth and the Finca Montepedroso white wine. Of course, with the drink they gave us a potato omelette tapa ü´ì ü•î which was delicious so we decided to stay and eat. The menu is very extensive and the product is of great quality. I recommend the artichokes with romesco sauce (of course homemade and delicious) and any burger üçî with their homemade friesüçü.  For dessert, as a croquette lover you have to try the dark chocolate ones üç´ ü§Øü§§.
If you doubt any choice, let Cipri advise you. Cozy place, impeccable service and attention and excellent value for money. To return without stopping!"
ChIJvbJaXwApQg0RIdMsjwR2Dbo,5,"The food at Cipri is the best in the area, it is always a good idea to come, everything is delicious. The menu is great and each dish has its personal touch.
We have been a couple of times, my most personal recommendation is the ear!!!!
Thank you Cipri for an unbeatable deal."
ChIJvbJaXwApQg0RIdMsjwR2Dbo,5,"If you want to eat very well, this is your place. Wonderful treatment, very good atmosphere and spectacular food. The quality of the meat is incredible. The hamburgers are tastier and what can we say about those homemade fries‚Ä¶ I will definitely return!
Edit review: this site is amazing. They never stop surprising you. Bestial tomato with burrata. It is really worth visiting this local place."
ChIJvbJaXwApQg0RIdMsjwR2Dbo,5,"What a change this long-standing bar has made!!!!
It is run by Cipri (owner) who has given it a turn for the better, an extensive wine list, quality portions and high-quality menus/cards.
Another point very much in its favor, the cleanliness in general‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
I put it on the neighborhood route without a doubt, it does not disappoint."
ChIJx5rTiFgpQg0RSSvrDhd51B8,5,"Since they moved from the Pe√±agrande Gallery to this new location, Tomas y Jesus. They take great care of you, and the products are more visible and here are some sample photos. Always following all anti-Covid regulations."
ChIJx5rTiFgpQg0RSSvrDhd51B8,5,"Very good service, always attentive and friendly. And very good quality products."

ChIJiTex_tMpQg0Rr7Dq6t_6OVo,5,"Busy Sunday and we decided to get some from them. Very friendly people.

Great food, good taste, nice portions. Overall nice customer experience. Will be repeating again for sure."
ChIJiTex_tMpQg0Rr7Dq6t_6OVo,5,Very good quality and flavor. We ordered 7 portions of Valencian and he gave us 8 and to repeat. Highly recommended.
ChIJiTex_tMpQg0Rr7Dq6t_6OVo,3,"A little disappointed with the rice. It was very flat in flavor; Of all the ingredients, there were barely two prawns and monkfish completely absent. I would not repeat rice again but I would still try another option in search of more luck.

Good location, correct, fast and easy service. The place looks clean."
ChIJiTex_tMpQg0Rr7Dq6t_6OVo,5,"Highly recommended. Generous portions. We ordered arroz a banda and Se√±oret, very tasty."
ChIJiTex_tMpQg0Rr7Dq6t_6OVo,5,"The best rice dishes in Madrid very close to home. They have a wide variety of rice: Valencian, black, vegetables, seafood... all the ones I have tried have been divine. The portions are generous, so when I have an event I trust them."
ChIJEZM5NFopQg0RB4bJrbYLSeM,5,"I walked in by chance for a coffee and was enchanted by the good atmosphere and the good treatment that its owners Pedro and Carlos provide to their customers. In addition to the coffee we had beers, the tapas portion was very delicious and the carrot cake 10/10 üëå"
ChIJEZM5NFopQg0RB4bJrbYLSeM,5,"A highly recommended cafeteria. It has good prices. Both Carlos and Pedro are very nice, they always have a smile. The place is cozy and you can see the love that has been put into it. As a detail, they have a feeder/drinker at the door for the furry ones."
ChIJEZM5NFopQg0RB4bJrbYLSeM,5,"Pedro and Carlos are super friendly, always with a smile, the food is fabulous and delicious, they prepare it with a lot of care and love.  There is an atmosphere of harmony and well-being.  ideal to go with friends or family and spend a good afternoon of football or hanging out with your friends."
ChIJEZM5NFopQg0RB4bJrbYLSeM,5,"I was there on Saturday with my friends and I was honestly pleasantly surprised since it is new in the neighborhood, it has a very cozy atmosphere to have a good time and share. Apart from the fact that the treatment of the people in charge is phenomenal, very good prices, attention and atmosphere!! Super recommended!!"
ChIJEZM5NFopQg0RB4bJrbYLSeM,5,"Excellent service, bar with tapas and drinks at a good price."
ChIJDa97do0pQg0R_BYEpStnoTo,4,In superable
ChIJDa97do0pQg0R_BYEpStnoTo,5,"Delicious food and better price. We recommend the tripe, which was very delicious. Large portions, wonderful‚Ä¶ Special mention to Alberto for a fast and friendly service that no longer exists. We will be back soon!"
ChIJDa97do0pQg0R_BYEpStnoTo,5,"The Ventu never fails, starting with Alberto's exceptional and fast service and continuing with the food that is really good. The menus are spectacular, absolutely every day you will find several dishes that will surprise you. The atmosphere and the terrace also help to have a great time."
ChIJDa97do0pQg0R_BYEpStnoTo,5,"Very good tapas bar and the waiter was charming, the torreznos in particular"
ChIJDa97do0pQg0R_BYEpStnoTo,5,"The quality is pleasantly surprising! We have ordered snails in sauce, mixed oxtail and boletus croquettes, tails and ear with brava sauce.
For dessert, chocolate death cake and white chocolate coulan with mango syrup. Spectacular!!
Very good attention from the waiter and speed,
We will be back :D"
ChIJi2plmZopQg0RmqtmNVy1u5o,5,A hidden gem in Barrio Del Pilar. The Art-Deco fa√ßade adds to the authenticity of the beautiful bakery and the cozy atmosphere they offer inside.
ChIJi2plmZopQg0RmqtmNVy1u5o,5,Top service! Top prices! Andddd super kindly waiters!!!
ChIJi2plmZopQg0RmqtmNVy1u5o,5,Traditional with delicious hand-made desserts for take away or by portions to enjoy there with good coffee.
ChIJi2plmZopQg0RmqtmNVy1u5o,4,Good variety. Good service. Liked the place overall
ChIJi2plmZopQg0RmqtmNVy1u5o,4,Awesome
ChIJXUh3g_IoQg0RtdF_E7jH1Ck,4,Cheap beer and excellent traditional Taco Bell food. Something that makes them apart from all the Spanish bound restaurants: tacos and nachos.
ChIJXUh3g_IoQg0RtdF_E7jH1Ck,5,"Taco Bell rocks as always!
The sits were not very comfortable but the prices and food are a MUST!"
ChIJXUh3g_IoQg0RtdF_E7jH1Ck,1,"I went to a Taco bell in Madrid, Spain in the Vagugada shopping center. I was treated as I was a pick pocket. The clients and employees semmed scared to me because I am blonde with blue eyes and they thought I was a guy from Romania. It is very racist and a studid stereotype... Very angry..."
ChIJXUh3g_IoQg0RtdF_E7jH1Ck,4,Nice Mexican food but limited options
ChIJXUh3g_IoQg0RtdF_E7jH1Ck,4,"Good food. Quick service. Order was complete, nothing missing. Staff understand English ( always a plus for me)."
ChIJFzozQZEpQg0RId3w4V4b3Yg,5,"Traditional bar, quality and good atmosphere.
Good Cuisine, whether for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
Close treatment, friendly and very nice staff."
ChIJFzozQZEpQg0RId3w4V4b3Yg,5,"I've been coming for breakfast for a while. Traditional bar with typical dishes. One of the best tortillas I've ever had. If you put tomato toast with a tortilla, it's a different story. The best place in the area."
ChIJFzozQZEpQg0RId3w4V4b3Yg,5,"We went to have a coffee and we craved some porras, delicious, crunchy, spongy.
The beautiful atmosphere and the very correct attention."
ChIJFzozQZEpQg0RId3w4V4b3Yg,1,"I've been in the neighborhood for a short time. Normally I like to consume in traditional places in the neighborhood. I entered this place this noon.  There was an empty table outside on the side, in fact there were two. No queue outside or anything like that. I asked a waiter inside to order, he tells me to order at the bar, then he asks me where I am and I tell him to go outside and in a very bad way he tells me well go outside because there are people waiting... I tell him: ok I didn't know because there is no one outside. And he tells me ""well I thought you were smarter"" and he goes so wide. I say excuse me? And he repeats it to me... that maybe you have to be smarter.  I ask him for the claim form and he denies it 3 times, telling me that he is the owner, until I remind him that he has the obligation to provide it to me. Never in my life have I been treated in such a contemptuous, rude and unpleasant way. I don't have to know how their establishment works or how they organize it. It's as simple as putting up a sign if you don't want to be asked...then we complain that traditional establishments are disappearing.  Right now after this incident I am in another place, not always, where they are treating me at least with respect, something that this man does not even know"
ChIJFzozQZEpQg0RId3w4V4b3Yg,4,"We had several starters for dinner to share between 6: tomato salads with burrata, very good grilled prawns, and potato omelette. And for the main course, the best: stone-grilled meat. We no longer had room for dessert, but we did have room for some coffees and txupitos. It cost us ‚Ç¨22 per person including 8 beers and a bottle of wine, an adequate price. The super friendly waiter."

ChIJyZIzEJApQg0RG1bQEd2pEA0,3,"The food was tasty.
The quality was average.
The delivery was adequately quick.
The price was s tad questionable.
Overall: good if you wish Chinese food quickly if quality isn't the main driver."
ChIJyZIzEJApQg0RG1bQEd2pEA0,4,"This review is for the Chinese lunch set menu. Portions are just nice. I went in feeling hungry, but was fully satisfied after the meal even though I tend to eat a lot. Food quality was decent at nine euros. Place was clean and waiter was attentive. I chose ice cream for dessert, and was expecting some cheap factory made ones but was pleasantly surprised that it was scooped and actually quite nice."
ChIJyZIzEJApQg0RG1bQEd2pEA0,3,Nice food but service was slow and food was a bit cold. Top floor of restaurant is nice with windows on three sides. Small park for tots near by.
ChIJyZIzEJApQg0RG1bQEd2pEA0,3,Chinese dishes quite good but a huge NO to sushi here.
ChIJyZIzEJApQg0RG1bQEd2pEA0,5,"We arrived as soon as it opened so we were alone, they served us quickly, and the food arrived very quickly.

We chose the ‚Ç¨13 menu with starter, two main dishes, drink and dessert.
The delicious flavors, especially the rice 3 delights. My only quibble is that my spring roll was dripping with a lot of oil and I'm not so happy about that."
ChIJEQPpjpopQg0Rql89ezzjcWM,5,"My partner and I loved this place! The pizza was quite large but very light due to the extra-thin pastry, the waitor was polite and friendly, offering us the home-made gaspacho for free and chatting in our native language. Prices are very reasonable and you can sit outside and enjoy the trees and quiet."
ChIJEQPpjpopQg0Rql89ezzjcWM,5,Jaw-dropping pizzas. 15 mins from ordering to yummy.
ChIJEQPpjpopQg0Rql89ezzjcWM,5,"Unas pizzas deliciosas, muy parecidas a las de un restaurante o hechas en casa pero disponibles en unos 15 20 min y a domicilio, un poco m√°s caras que similares opciones pero la calidad es mejor y el tama√±o algo mayor. Masa m√°s fina-normal que gruesa y muy generosos con el queso.
El servicio siempre es estupendo y todo esto junto hace que sea my elecci√≥n de pizzeria preferida."
ChIJEQPpjpopQg0Rql89ezzjcWM,1,Yesterday I placed an order and it arrived much later than the stated time. They don't pick up the phone when you call or they leave you on hold without picking up the phone to ask about the order and since the order has already been paid you can't do anything because the food arrived burnt.
ChIJEQPpjpopQg0Rql89ezzjcWM,5,"Unbeatable delivery man: Yesterday, April 17, 2025, we ordered 2 family pizzas (crazy goat, truffle, carbonara and bacon cheeseburger), delicious as always. But what stood out was the wonderful attention of the delivery man (I think he was Venezuelan) professional, smiling and friendly. Furthermore, I made a mistake with the change and, apart from the tip, I accidentally gave him ‚Ç¨10 extra, and he was honest and came home to return it to me. Please let this delivery person know about this review!"
ChIJe6j_1Y0pQg0RTtfOBdRtR3E,5,"Good atmosphere for the football, limited selection of beer but was served perfectly cold. Way better than the xxx Rover where all the TVs are out of synch"
ChIJe6j_1Y0pQg0RTtfOBdRtR3E,5,"It's a great place to come with friends if you want to celebrate something, but also a great place to just hang out with friends. Drinks are great and mojitos AMAZING. Waiters are INCREDIBLE and 100% recommend."
ChIJe6j_1Y0pQg0RTtfOBdRtR3E,4,"This must be the only Irish pub which doesn't serve Guinness, but the stout that is available is good enough. The atmosphere is nice, the staff is good and the choice of music isn't too bad and luckily not so loud you cannot have a conversation."
ChIJe6j_1Y0pQg0RTtfOBdRtR3E,5,Good atmosphere lots of people just finnished work place was buzzin
ChIJe6j_1Y0pQg0RTtfOBdRtR3E,3,"Not what expected when you go to an Irish pub, the DJ needs to check the music, as it's not according to the place"
ChIJteqWzowpQg0R2Vs4iU7l0m8,3,"The place is not bad but I wouldn't recommend it. The meat was not very tasty, neither the entrec√¥te nor the skewers. The photo looks better than it tastes. The potatoes are very delicious. The paella, ok.

The VERY thing that could be improved is the service, especially from a waiter. These types of people should not work in front of the public, it is clear that they do not like their work, they gave us three cuts without even mentioning that we were left in shock. We are educated people and anyway... The rest, correct, without further ado."
ChIJteqWzowpQg0R2Vs4iU7l0m8,4,"We ordered a menu (‚Ç¨30). Strong and very rich. Good quality-price. The razor clams had a little sand, the cannelloni and the meat were very delicious. The cheesecake, normal. Good place to eat. I would return."
ChIJteqWzowpQg0R2Vs4iU7l0m8,5,"Without a doubt the best place in the neighborhood. Excellent price quality. The daily menu is ‚Ç¨12 and of great quality, the quantity is abundant. The weekend menu is ‚Ç¨18. The menu is great with great variety. Be sure to try the pickled salmon and the anchovy and avocado tartare. Great to go with family and children. The atmosphere is calm and the treatment is familiar. By the way, Juanjo (waiter) and Silverio in the kitchen are crackers. I leave you a photo of the menu."
ChIJteqWzowpQg0R2Vs4iU7l0m8,5,"We are from the area and we usually go from time to time. The kitchen has made great progress for the better. Something to eat with a very pleasant wine.

In the case of desserts, I ordered a coulan that comes with ice cream, very good and careful (chocolate on top, icing sugars...

The service is good and the prices fair."
ChIJteqWzowpQg0R2Vs4iU7l0m8,4,"Small restaurant, with a menu of several dishes, all appetizing, all the dishes quite good, even abundant, except for the entrecote that we ordered, quite disappointing, comparing it with the rest of the dishes, I started talking and I forgot to take photos of the entrecote, the menu is ‚Ç¨30"
ChIJY80HjIspQg0RH1_0NGEICR0,5,"Good service, speed, kindness and friendliness. Giant screen. Many tables and terrace. Good prices. Beers of various brands, always with an aperitif. Very good sandwiches"
ChIJY80HjIspQg0RH1_0NGEICR0,5,"We really like this place! It is in a place where you would appreciate a normal bar where you can have a drink with an aperitif and at a normal price!
The tapas are very delicious and the attention is excellent!!"
ChIJY80HjIspQg0RH1_0NGEICR0,1,"I'll put you in the situation,... working day at 3:50 p.m.,... open and with people consuming inside and outside; Three people came in and asked what to eat when they saw wings, croquettes, etc. on display, and with surprise the waitress responded that the kitchen was closed, but then what you're displaying is made of plastic? Without further explanation Looking towards the entrance it does not indicate the door,... one star is overrated,... :-("
ChIJY80HjIspQg0RH1_0NGEICR0,5,"I love everything, good food and good price. The service of 10 from all the waiters, special mention to Roxy. I recommend it."
ChIJY80HjIspQg0RH1_0NGEICR0,4,"Large place with a good terrace on a wide sidewalk. The food is good, you can order from the menu and they also have special offers with some dishes."
ChIJX-aJWZApQg0RqsszbmYm1DI,5,"Always fast and on point, just now I went to the local instead of my usual delivery. Missed something on my order and when called they sent it to my house with extra stuff in a matter of minutes. Excellent staff"

ChIJRxuaJpspQg0RZW_pIjsG5fk,3,"They have a lot of variety of dishes, I had meatballs and they were good, but the service is very slow, they have their regular customers who they bring appetizers with their drinks, nothing for us... and they want to charge in cash, not by card. ..they don't give you a ticket, if the treasury knew...."
ChIJRxuaJpspQg0RZW_pIjsG5fk,1,We made a reservation at 2 and left at 4:30. It took them 45 minutes to request the order. Maddening. There is a waiter who literally does nothing.
ChIJRxuaJpspQg0RZW_pIjsG5fk,4,"Pre-Christmas party for members, as always, great. Good atmosphere and luxury facilities. Today the Cup and the free buffet for members. It is appreciated because you know your neighbors. Good place. Good sports facilities."

ChIJA0giWpApQg0RHPeqKpuKCy4,5,"The menu of the day is really good, and very well priced. It is a very good quality sushi, one of the best in the area. The noodles on the daily menu are also incredibly good. Without a doubt it is a total success of a restaurant. The day we eat sushi we are much happier!!! üç£"
ChIJG7MXjJopQg0R1jg6iqf6idg,5,Typical Spanish cuisine that shows dedication to each dish.
ChIJG7MXjJopQg0R1jg6iqf6idg,1,"Unpresentable! With all the letters.
Today, April 5, 2025, I call the number on your page at 11:19 and a man picks up (so to speak). In a 20-second conversation, he takes my order, for a chicken and a potato, for 2:30 p.m.
Confident, I came down at the scheduled time and they told me that they had not written down the order and that they were sorry but that they did not have food to give me. THAT IS THE SOLUTION.
I left indignant and called another ""food and chicken"" house on Betanzos Street, just 5 minutes away, ""El Sabroso"", who answered the call and gave me the food.
One less for a neighborhood business. Goodbye"
ChIJG7MXjJopQg0R1jg6iqf6idg,5,"For a few years now we have been ordering paella here, which is more than recommended. From time to time we also take other dishes. None have disappointed us, although our favorites are the chicken and cod croquettes, the eggplants (which we tried today, delicious), the roast chicken, the omelette and the lasagna. In short, we are regular customers and will continue to be. Very good service, fair prices and delicious food :)"
ChIJG7MXjJopQg0R1jg6iqf6idg,1,"Disappointing takeaway potato omelette.
I ordered a potato omelette with onion and when I got home my surprise when I uncovered it was the intense burnt smell. On the outside it didn't look burnt and it even looked appetizing, however when you tasted it the only thing you could appreciate was the intense burnt flavor.
When we called the store to discuss the disappointment and understand what could have happened, there was no apology on their part nor did they assume the possibility of having made a mistake."
ChIJG7MXjJopQg0R1jg6iqf6idg,5,"Good croquettes, the potato omelette they gave us was freshly made and very good. The potatoes with 2 cheap and delicious sauces. In short: reasonable prices and homemade food."

The chicken available is free range so healthy in comparison to cage grown chicken."

ChIJS42p9pspQg0RofUGol3j_h4,5,"Traditional shop in the market in La Vaguada in Madrid, specialized in all types of poultry and delicatessen: partridges, top quality chickens, turkey, rabbits, Moorish skewers, special eggs, all very well presented. They also have a prepared food store, with a wide variety, to be able to organize quality lunches and dinners without having to cook. For the holidays they raise the bar even higher. Highly recommended. Very competent and friendly staff."

ChIJe6j_1Y0pQg0RdHvAK-xxoUQ,2,"We selected this place because of the close proximity and availability of sushi, what the kids wanted. Unfortunately the quality of the selection was relatively low and we felt it was overpriced compared to what you get."
ChIJc7huVpkpQg0RwbaIrZOoJdw,3,"Onion rings are too oily. (Fried a lot)
No free mayo
Toilet: I used it for washing hand only. For that it was good.
Small sizes are very small.(they are kid sizes. The small twister wrap is not a big as your hand. Maybe 13 cm long. Very small. And a few potato chips.
(Even the ketchups are very small.)
Also they don‚Äôt have as much variety as I have seen in UK."

ChIJM6GexI4pQg0RucgxtdFn0vg,3,I am not a big fan of rodilla. I remember it from 15 years ago and it seemed a lot better back then. Now the sandwiches seem bland and the fillings taste very processed. Staff were friendly and efficient though and the decor is nice.

ChIJ6ZNyiJEpQg0RX57JAfMP-ec,3,"WITHOUT PRETENTIONS

Tiny bar without too many pretensions, doubles and thirds at a good price on the terrace (‚Ç¨2.20 and ‚Ç¨2.50 respectively).
The tap beer is Cruzcampo (ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and the thirds are Vitoria Malaga, they also have bottles of Heineken.
With some of the rounds they put something to snack on.
The waiters are friendly."
ChIJ6ZNyiJEpQg0RX57JAfMP-ec,4,"They recommended this place to my girlfriend and I, because a friend knows the owner. The truth is that it is a spectacular place. The octopus is delicious and the tripe are spectacular. The treatment is super close and they are attentive to anything you want. The truth is that we left this place very happy. We will return."
ChIJ6ZNyiJEpQg0RX57JAfMP-ec,1,"Friendly owner but the waitress was super rude, I asked for a coffee at the bar and after 20 minutes they hadn't served it yet, I had to leave because I couldn't wait and on the next visit I was told in my face that I had left and that I wouldn't come back again.
I have never been treated like this, I will never set foot there again."
ChIJ6ZNyiJEpQg0RX57JAfMP-ec,5,"Without comments, you couldn't ask for more, the incredible appetizers, the spectacular service, I will remain loyal to this bar, I recommend it to everyone who passes by there"

ChIJeSQTWJkpQg0RP540_byjjnk,5,"The food taste good and well-served. Ate Farina and Ate Cris are very nice, they always serve with a smile.

ChIJeSQTWJkpQg0RP540_byjjnk,5,"I had a fantastic experience at Udon La Vaguada! The food was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented.

ChIJyepSD5wpQg0R8Ckk4PKS_54,5,"We‚Äôve been in a few of these restaurants and the quality is always on point burgers and salads too! The only tip that I‚Äôll have to say is that the hamburgers are not so big so you‚Äôll have to order at least two of them depending on your appetite üòâ. Highly recommended on Thursdays, they have a 2x1 on cheeseburgers!! üôå"
ChIJyepSD5wpQg0R8Ckk4PKS_54,5,They have special 2 for 1 burgers on Thursdays. Their thinly sliced aros de cebolla is amazing and addictive. I recommend the pulled pork burger.
ChIJyepSD5wpQg0R8Ckk4PKS_54,1,"ES EL P√âSIMO!
This is by far the worst place I have been to in whole Madrid.
The workers are not willing to work or offer you anything.
I told the receptionist my wife is pregnant and we wanted to have the food well-done but the cook told me, no can do!
After waiting for around 20 minutes they served all the Glovo services first,( I don't know who has the priority !!!!) and when they brought the food, it was already cold!( there were only few people sitting at the tables)
I asked them to re-heat it and they accepted it very half-heartedly,however, after another 10 minutes the only thing which was heat up was the fries!!!

I would give them less than zero points but since I can't, I will give them 0 out of 10!

La √∫ltima vez que comemos aqu√≠! HORRIBLE!
NO LO RECOMIENDO PARA NADA!"
ChIJyepSD5wpQg0R8Ckk4PKS_54,5,"Excellent burger and fries! They cook them up very fast, and the quality is great. The beers on tap are ice cold; and if you're feeling froggy, the ice cream is fantastic! The place is great for kids, and has a cute decor."

ChIJ0TJ5BpwpQg0RXGyHu0_0ku0,1,"Yesterday I went to McDonald's with my family and there were a lot of crowds around. When we were looking at the free table, we went to the free table and everything was not clean. And on the chair there was a hamburger bun and we said to the lady with glasses (the McDonald's cleaner) that we should pick it up, but we are not employees and we are customers. And also the floor was dirty and it is not clean. The lady should respect the environment of the clients and clean the floor too because we don't want to return to this dirty place."
ChIJ0TJ5BpwpQg0RXGyHu0_0ku0,4,I was really happy with what i had ordered. ‚Ç¨5.75 for a triple chicken burger with large fries and a drink. I find the price is quite reasonable and there were ample free tables to have a quick bite or take as long as you want. I also had cheesecake @ 2.50 which was amazing. The server was also kind enough to offer me some toppings like chocolate or berry but i like it just the way it is. So overall a happy experience.
ChIJ0TJ5BpwpQg0RXGyHu0_0ku0,1,"I know that a fast food restaurant in a shopping mall usually gets crowded, but this has to be taken into consideration, they seemed to be short handed. They took about 20 minutes to give us the order and it was poorly arranged, fries were less than warm, the happy box meal was crushed in, there were no tables available and the ones that we saw empty were all dirty (part of the client‚Äôs fault too) and because of that the trash bins were full and the floor was also dirty even on the tables outside in the hallway. We told an employee at the McCafe that the napkins dispenser was empty so instead of giving us a few she just told us to ‚Äúlook again‚Äù. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we will always love and go to McDonald‚Äôs but this time I think it got a bit out of hand, is not always about ‚Äúsell sell sell‚Äù."
ChIJ0TJ5BpwpQg0RXGyHu0_0ku0,4,Had a coffee after lunch good place to relax with a drink or icecream
ChIJ0TJ5BpwpQg0RXGyHu0_0ku0,4,"I loved the dark theme, the many different seating options and the general feeling of this McD!"
ChIJOdy3CZwpQg0RyVih2S2w8Jk,3,"It takes forever to get to the counter. They are super slow. The product is great, and it's worth the wait, but many people left the line, yet it took more than 20 minutes to get to it. Either you hire more staff or train them to be faster."
ChIJOdy3CZwpQg0RyVih2S2w8Jk,5,Really nice frozen yogurt place. You get to choose different fruits and flavours to add to your ice cream and pretty much any combination is guaranteed to taste really well.
ChIJOdy3CZwpQg0RyVih2S2w8Jk,4,"It's an  interesting  ice cream that they have, but it depends who likes this type."

ChIJTV2sCJwpQg0RkA2qdrge1e0,3,"Most of the places to eat at the Vaguada are pretty mediocre, and this one is par for the course. If you are in the mood for lots of fried food, this place will be an acceptable choice. Most of their fried raciones are pretty greasy, but I did enjoy the cazon(fried marinated shark). Make sure you are not in a hurry because the service here is slow."
ChIJTV2sCJwpQg0RkA2qdrge1e0,2,"Preparing food without any gloves on and sold us food on the menu to tell us after they were out, without as much as an ""I'm sorry"". Normally I like their food but bad service is a reason for not coming back."

ChIJjdjCJ5wpQg0R5SfIoYqpY2E,5,Great quality food at a fraction of the price in other similar restaurants. They are also famous for their great team of waiters who do their best to make everyone feel at home while sticking to the COVID protocols.
ChIJjdjCJ5wpQg0R5SfIoYqpY2E,4,"Good place to eat A LOT for a small price, with 10‚Ç¨ you get a complete meal at lunch time. The portions are really big, no one at my table could finish everything. If you want to eat just once per day, this is your place."
ChIJjdjCJ5wpQg0R5SfIoYqpY2E,4,"Love the orejas aperitivo. Sometimes the paella is good too. The alitas are better at Casa Pepe of course but when they have different tapas at night, they're usually delicious, if not heavily fried"
ChIJjdjCJ5wpQg0R5SfIoYqpY2E,3,"Nothing special. A bar along the street where you can seat and have a beer and some tapas or raciones, but don't expect something beyond average."
ChIJjdjCJ5wpQg0R5SfIoYqpY2E,3,Typical Spanish food and tapas. The restaurant is ok...but the best is the bar...with your drink a BIG tapa is served...
ChIJf_lN-pspQg0Rpm2-10QCCoU,3,"The staff were fast and attentive at the beginning and midway through our meal, which was great. The food came out quickly, but unfortunately, it was cold. We were too hungry to send it back, but just something to keep in mind. The music was also a bit too loud, making it hard to fully enjoy the meal.

Since we came just before their lunch break, it took a while to get the bill as most of the staff had gone on break. Overall, a decent experience but with a few things that could be improved."
ChIJf_lN-pspQg0Rpm2-10QCCoU,5,"Great food but visiting during busy hours on a Saturday night can be a bit hectic. We had a few incidents which was understandable because every single table was occupied and it is a big restaurant but the staff were really helpful.

I recommend visiting during quieter hours."
ChIJf_lN-pspQg0Rpm2-10QCCoU,5,"We've tried all 3 salads and the wings combo with both sauces. Great food for a good price, the virgin pina colada and the Virgin strawberry daiquiri is also amazing.

Extra point is the amazing service of Yokasta, she is really nice and patient and immediately provided us the wet wipes after eating our wings without even prompting. 10/10 service!"
ChIJf_lN-pspQg0Rpm2-10QCCoU,5,"the food was great, they serve faster than usual but still the taste and quality didn't affect it. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The ambience of the place is so tranquil and nice. Recommend."
ChIJf_lN-pspQg0Rpm2-10QCCoU,5,I always come back here for a good meal. I like my meat half done with potato wedges and bell peppers. This was my first time trying this meal and it was great! The food was very tasty!
ChIJIQSznZ4pQg0Roby7jNti0Hg,5,Amazing flavors
ChIJIQSznZ4pQg0Roby7jNti0Hg,3,Food was tasteless. No salt.
ChIJIQSznZ4pQg0Roby7jNti0Hg,4,Gg bro
ChIJIQSznZ4pQg0Roby7jNti0Hg,5,Love their burger
ChIJIQSznZ4pQg0Roby7jNti0Hg,5,Cool!!
ChIJVTTQuXcpQg0RhnlJzaaXH5g,1,Came for menu del d√≠a that costed 14‚Ç¨. Very oily food and not good. Not going to repeat again. I don't get it why it is highly rated
ChIJVTTQuXcpQg0RhnlJzaaXH5g,3,10'50 daily menu
ChIJVTTQuXcpQg0RhnlJzaaXH5g,3,Bn
ChIJVTTQuXcpQg0RhnlJzaaXH5g,2,"I couldn't get to eat there because we couldn't get in with the twin stroller, at the entrance it has two corner doors that make entry very difficult for people with reduced mobility or baby strollers. A shame, because the food looks exquisite. We will try to come back later üòâ"
ChIJVTTQuXcpQg0RhnlJzaaXH5g,5,"The food was excellent, the staff very friendly and attentive, they served the dishes quickly, which is why we have eaten there several times."
ChIJsx_Xe54pQg0RBeyG_XEUWR8,2,The eating hall Has an offensive odour.
ChIJsx_Xe54pQg0RBeyG_XEUWR8,1,No idea just walked past. Stop spying one.
ChIJsx_Xe54pQg0RBeyG_XEUWR8,5,Good taken care of.
ChIJsx_Xe54pQg0RBeyG_XEUWR8,4,"First time going and I liked it a lot.
Friendly and fast service. The food is very delicious.
I don't give 5 stars because it was quite cold inside the restaurant and it was uncomfortable."
ChIJsx_Xe54pQg0RBeyG_XEUWR8,3,Normal cuisine all good üëç
ChIJM0WtSZ0pQg0RgGVWYe1UVPg,4,Renovations give slightly more space but not a significant update.
ChIJM0WtSZ0pQg0RgGVWYe1UVPg,5,"Los Pico's was a quick stop on my walking journey through north of Madrid. I had a nice cafe con leche and I could notice the great variety of jamones and cheeses as well a vast options of tapas. Friendly stuff as well as the crowd.
It was a very good descovery."
ChIJM0WtSZ0pQg0RgGVWYe1UVPg,5,Awesome bar with great support.
ChIJM0WtSZ0pQg0RgGVWYe1UVPg,5,"Definitely, best bar in the neighborhood"
ChIJM0WtSZ0pQg0RgGVWYe1UVPg,5,Great place with only locals...
ChIJc7huVpkpQg0RwtjwauwDKx0,1,"One of the worst and most despicable restaurants I have ever eaten in. It is not just about the quality of the food, but also about the good treatment and communication style. I stood for a long time and the restaurant in front of me was empty. The waitress did not allow us to enter except with her instructions and orders. Her way of treating us was strange and rude. She is the one who brings the orders, delivers them, brings people into the restaurant, receives payment, and does everything she does. Even after we asked for the bill, we waited a long time. It is a nightmare and a very bad thing. The experience, place, and people are strange."
ChIJc7huVpkpQg0RwtjwauwDKx0,5,"Food, atmosphere and especially service was spectacular. Our waitresses was Aida and she made an amazing  job. Very helpful and kind.Totally recommend this place."
ChIJc7huVpkpQg0RwtjwauwDKx0,5,"It was very good and the waitress name SARA attended us and take care of us very well and she very kind and respectful, We will be back for sure!!!"
ChIJc7huVpkpQg0RwtjwauwDKx0,5,Incredibly delicious pasta! Large portions and good selection.
ChIJc7huVpkpQg0RwtjwauwDKx0,5,"great place to have Italian food,  highly recommend."
ChIJT1c0DpwpQg0R5RNwBV6-3QQ,3,I have one drink free today üòÄ
ChIJT1c0DpwpQg0R5RNwBV6-3QQ,4,"Too much noise, but still a nice spot to have a rest and get a refreshing drink"
ChIJT1c0DpwpQg0R5RNwBV6-3QQ,4,"Service is friendly, free wifi, two nice seating areas to hang out in!"
ChIJT1c0DpwpQg0R5RNwBV6-3QQ,4,They could have options for those who want to reduce added sugars
ChIJT1c0DpwpQg0R5RNwBV6-3QQ,2,Service is really slow.
ChIJWwRWC5wpQg0RowV7eOqwSfM,5,"I went for launch, the place is nice, friendly and helpful staff, specifically wiater (Hammody), when he found that we have some dietary restrictions he kept on explaining and translating the menu to help us choose what it is best for us
Resonable prices for the food and service
Highly recommened"
ChIJWwRWC5wpQg0RowV7eOqwSfM,3,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The service was relatively good, but the food was mediocre. None of it had great flavor. We ordered an Entrecot ‚Äúen su punto‚Äù which should‚Äôve been no more than medium rare, and it was more like medium well. Our appetizer was a mini tortellini, and it was dry with little flavor. We ordered a 7 cheese rigatoni, and the cheese wasn‚Äôt creamy nor very flavorful. Overall a mediocre meal at a nice place."
ChIJWwRWC5wpQg0RowV7eOqwSfM,4,"The taste and quality of the lasagna was good, the salad was fantastic , with a large space and cool decoration."
ChIJWwRWC5wpQg0RowV7eOqwSfM,3,"Large dishes with decent quality.
The pasta carbonara is good although a bit more creamy will be nicer.
The lasagna traditional tasted ok but was a bit too greasy which made it a bit heavy.
Coffee was decent for the standards.
Service was good and quick and they accommodated us very quickly including the buggy for the kids."
ChIJWwRWC5wpQg0RowV7eOqwSfM,4,"This Italian restaurant is very to recommend. It has a very nice Italian ambiance with always running Italian music and Italian menu. The food comes fast and it¬¥s really good. Only our Italian pizza, fresh from the own restaurant oven, was served cold on our table. (-1 Star)"
ChIJTWuRK5wpQg0RKZpBuj5bEPo,2,"I should have read the reviews.

German restaurant with only two Germans beers and only one of them is on tap.

Croquettes de queso: pretty good. Obviously frozen and reheated but tasty and with a good sauce.

Nachos: an abomination and an affront to god. To make it worse the only hot sauce they have is Tabasco

Hot dogs: tiny sad things buried in buns with frozen French fries. The German uses poor condiments including a basic American style mustard. As an American all I can ask is why?? The Americano is ‚Äúasi asi‚Äù

Two front of house people during dinner rush were overwhelmed."
ChIJTWuRK5wpQg0RKZpBuj5bEPo,4,"Food was good, the salad was tasty, the sausages and the chucroute too‚Ä¶
Service was not at his best.
Atmosphere is okay-ish as you eat in a mall‚Ä¶
Overall experience is okay, 48‚Ç¨ for two people. Food was good.
I would still recommend‚Ä¶"
ChIJTWuRK5wpQg0RKZpBuj5bEPo,1,"Worst restaurant Ive been too. I ordered a menu with 3 courses, two of them were missing and I they brought me a different main dish,which was cold. At the end,they charged me for everything"
ChIJTWuRK5wpQg0RKZpBuj5bEPo,5,Perfect food and excelente service from balbu awesome!!
ChIJTWuRK5wpQg0RKZpBuj5bEPo,4,"Grest spot for l8nch, food good, service and prices good also"
ChIJr7rsli8pQg0RSLYXm6_7uTY,2,"The first time I came here, a couple of months back, it was great. Probably because it was quiet...

Today, we were seated after queuing for 10 minutes - seeing one couple walk straight in and sit down - and then waited over an hour to be served our main. When it arrived, having asked for a 'No Pollo' vegan dish, there were prawns and beef. They said a replacement would come in 6-8 minutes and it was very good. But no offer of a reduction and, frankly, one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.

The food is good. If you go, check it's quiet first. But I won't be visiting again."
ChIJr7rsli8pQg0RSLYXm6_7uTY,5,"Halal Thai street in Madrid !!!
It is one of the best finds. The food is freshly
Prepared, everything I tried was 10/10.
Amazing place with very friendly staff
Will come again soon"
ChIJr7rsli8pQg0RSLYXm6_7uTY,5,Great noodles I love the Kids menu fun atmosphere and great service
ChIJr7rsli8pQg0RSLYXm6_7uTY,1,The food was very salty. Toooo much soya sauce. I will not recommend. And vegetables are barely present.
ChIJr7rsli8pQg0RSLYXm6_7uTY,5,Food was super nice and tasty. Wished I could order everything on the menu. Staff is super friendly. NASEER was so energetic and great guy. Must try cheesecake with lotus topping. New Yaowarat chicken with noddles was yummy. Such a good taste of Penang curry.
ChIJOyMTWJkpQg0Rp1rCbi87LNA,5,"We had a great waiter, Jesus, who took care of us all night and made sure everything was perfect. His great service really made the experience fantastic. Will be back!"
ChIJOyMTWJkpQg0Rp1rCbi87LNA,4,Okay food. The restaurant was a bit busy for a week night but the service was correct.
ChIJOyMTWJkpQg0Rp1rCbi87LNA,3,"Only one waitress can speak English, but not as well. She is so kind and helpful :) The food was so tasty :) The menu is only 11,95‚Ç¨, it's including a drink, starter, main dishes, desert/coffee. So cheap ;)"
ChIJOyMTWJkpQg0Rp1rCbi87LNA,4,"Food was good but the quantity of the tomate that came with the bread was too little, we had to ask for 3 times the tomate to have enough to spread on the bread"
ChIJOyMTWJkpQg0Rp1rCbi87LNA,3,"The food is acceptable if looking for a known quantity type of establishment. They do serve gluten free pancakes, which is a big reason we go. Crazy cheap prices too!"
ChIJD1Ud8ZspQg0R64t17smWSvw,5,"Excellent, highly recommended, knife cutting service, high quality products, very professional Felipe"
ChIJD1Ud8ZspQg0R64t17smWSvw,5,Magnificent professionals and a great product.
ChIJD1Ud8ZspQg0R64t17smWSvw,5,"Very good place to buy, I recommend it. Very friendly people"
ChIJD1Ud8ZspQg0R64t17smWSvw,5,"The product is of spectacular quality, and the service is exquisite. You can't ask for more. It is always a success to choose this establishment."
ChIJD1Ud8ZspQg0R64t17smWSvw,5,"What I don't like is that they work with gloves, they don't take them off to charge you and they handle money and products. Better without them and wash your hands which is more hygienic"
ChIJmzhlGYspQg0RVEXFukbQJyM,5,"We absolutely loved the food here! As a family living in the UK, we often miss authentic Spanish cuisine, and this place truly delivered. The flavors were spot on, and the quality was fantastic, especially for the price. The children had a great time as well, which made the experience even better. Highly recommended for anyone craving a taste of Spain!"
ChIJmzhlGYspQg0RVEXFukbQJyM,5,"We were a party of 8 on a busy Sunday evening and we didn't have a reservation. However, the staff was so kind to accommodate us and that we are so grateful. The ambience is classy and cozy with popular oldies music on the background üòâ The dishes arrived piping hot  and they were all so delicious and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. The staff who waited on us was a very likeable person with friendly disposition. Pricewise, we received a decent bill. Thanks for the great dining experience at the La Vaguada location."
ChIJmzhlGYspQg0RVEXFukbQJyM,5,"For a franchise restaurant in a shopping mall, this place is a pleasant surprise. With modern deco and excellent professional service, it made for a fantastic break from all the shopping. Food is scrumptious and tasty, and the price / quality ratio is perfect. Your taste buds won't be disappointed. Its served surprisingly professionally decorated on your plate. My only suggestion is that they cook their chicken breasts in the tika masala sauce to prevent them being so dry."
ChIJmzhlGYspQg0RVEXFukbQJyM,5,"Are you looking for a quiet and relaxed place to enjoy a delicious dinner?
Come here, from the attention to my arrival it was worth it.
The quality and taste of the food without a doubt I give it a 100%.
Of course I will be back!"
ChIJmzhlGYspQg0RVEXFukbQJyM,1,"What is worst than asking for your steak well done and they send it all bloody. Send it back and they brought it back bloody again and the mashed potatoes in a pool of blood. First thing I asked the waiter, which his attitude was really rude and unpleasant. Please make sure is well done, I really don‚Äôt like blood‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. NOPE üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I think Taco Bell would have done it better."
ChIJvx42OAApQg0RMji7ZQMRdjY,5,"Incredible. The burgers are delicious, super big.
The guy who helped us was very friendly and willing. Only details, the beef burger was a little raw, he didn't ask the point"
ChIJvx42OAApQg0RMji7ZQMRdjY,1,"Nos ha sorprendido el mal servicio de esta noche por parte de una empleada, al llegar preguntamos por el 2x1 y nos dicen que no tienen cuando en los carteles dice que tienen para todas las hamburguesas salvo en d√≠as festivos. Al querer cambiar lo que hab√≠amos pedido la se√±ora toda grosera nos dice que no podemos cambiarlo. Teniendo que cancelar el pedido y volviendo a comprarlo y dicha empleada con mala cara. Hemos comido en este sitio varias veces y nunca nos han atendido as√≠ de mal, una decepci√≥n con esta empleada"
ChIJvx42OAApQg0RMji7ZQMRdjY,5,"Very good place, the best burgers I have ever tried, Ver√≥nica and Daniel are very good employees, charismatic, they always serve us in the best way, we come to the place very often because we like the products and the attention they provide.

The quality of the meat is the best, that's why there is nothing like a Good Burger."
ChIJvx42OAApQg0RMji7ZQMRdjY,1,"We have returned after a while and the meat of the hamburgers is very poor quality compared to before, the chicken ones were very oily, the potatoes were good. Some soft drinks just tasted like carbonated water, there is no ventilation if you want to eat upstairs you end up breathing and smelling like grease/oil. There was a mistake in the order, although it was the least of it. We spent the whole night with horrible digestion, discomfort and heaviness in our stomach..."
ChIJvx42OAApQg0RMji7ZQMRdjY,5,"Today I went to order a smash burger, the quality of the meat was very much above the average for hamburgers, I really liked it and I didn't feel stuffed, it was simply delicious, you should try the option of artisan fries, it would be very good for your hamburgers and the fact that the creams are artisanal, I think they would have a very big plus compared to the competition.

PS: I took a bite because not only did it look good, it tasted good!!"
ChIJK0UEcZkpQg0RfkDCoUklTus,4,"Good bar where having breakfast is not expensive at all. Cortado, coffee with milk and 1/2 of toasted bread with natural tomato costs ‚Ç¨3.70 on the terrace.
They have corduroy hydrogel hand disinfection on each table. It is a place to support"
ChIJK0UEcZkpQg0RfkDCoUklTus,5,"Type of Spanish tapas bar, without a menu, they ""sing it"" to you and they may not always have the same thing. We have ordered croquettes, calamari, ears and bravas. All very rich. The service takes it calmly, it is not to come in a hurry, but the treatment is very good. Highly recommended place to come even with children. I recommend the terrace and the bread is included with the portions."
ChIJK0UEcZkpQg0RfkDCoUklTus,5,"The aioli from this place are spectacular, tender and cold potatoes, the sauce with just the right amount of garlic (and that is ""enough"") and a basket with bread to accompany it. Portion for 5 euros, immaculate, at the level of the best. The cover with the correct double.

The waiter is serious but very friendly. Near CC La Vaguada."
ChIJK0UEcZkpQg0RfkDCoUklTus,5,"Our place to ""have a drink"", whether in the morning or afternoon. Very reasonable prices, abundant and varied tapas and great service. We spend at least 2 times a week."
ChIJK0UEcZkpQg0RfkDCoUklTus,5,"Neighborhood bar, very good service. And the toasts with ham....huge. I have already come a couple of times. It is right in front of the district council and the valley park"
ChIJZxqGnwQpQg0RH-dyyyxfGbA,5,Delicious burger! Plenty of sauces. Theres vegetarian options aswell.
ChIJZxqGnwQpQg0RH-dyyyxfGbA,5,"We were a big family, staff were very welcoming, service was efficient. Excellent attention from Kamila, she made our experience unique and personalized. Very recommended!"
ChIJZxqGnwQpQg0RH-dyyyxfGbA,4,Very nice burgers! And Nicole was very kind to us :)
ChIJZxqGnwQpQg0RH-dyyyxfGbA,5,Mario the best
ChIJZxqGnwQpQg0RH-dyyyxfGbA,5,"Exee,"
ChIJVVVVVXQpQg0RhVIu6J8sGMU,5,"We went for lunch and had a great time! The food was delicious, and the service was excellent. The staff was attentive and happy to cook the meat to your preferred doneness. We highly recommend it! ü´∂üèª"
ChIJVVVVVXQpQg0RhVIu6J8sGMU,1,"The meat is the worse quality. I don't eat red meat and I told them once I arrived at the place.  I kept asking for meat well done and nothing. They also ""force"" you to order a drink cause this is the ""rule"". This is by far the worse restaurant I've been in Madrid and do not recommend it."
ChIJVVVVVXQpQg0RhVIu6J8sGMU,5,Strongly recommended!the food is really delicious and you will enjoy the music and entertainment there!
ChIJVVVVVXQpQg0RhVIu6J8sGMU,4,Friendly staff. Nice place. A lot of food. Nice buffet. If you are meat lover you will love it.
ChIJVVVVVXQpQg0RhVIu6J8sGMU,5,"Even as a foreigner you get good service, good food and a very affordable price.
There were many people and they music was on the louder side to get through the talk. But it wasnt bothering.
Also a very cool concept with getting the meat from skewers"
ChIJeywJ4rMpQg0RboO8eef_bBM,4,"I‚Äôve been coming to this restaurant regularly and have always loved the food, the service, and the atmosphere. It‚Äôs one of my favorite places, and I‚Äôve recommended it to many friends. However, I was quite disappointed with my experience today.

I arrived around 4 p.m., knowing the restaurant closes at 4:30. I was immediately asked to choose everything at once because of the time, which I completely understood and was happy to do. I gave my full order right away.

But after 20 minutes, the cashier came back to inform me that a major part of my order ‚Äî actually, the best item on the menu in my opinion, wasn‚Äôt available. I understand that I came close to closing time, but this should have been mentioned before we sat down, chose our meals, and placed our order, not after waiting 20 minutes.

I still really like this place, but I hope next time communication is a bit clearer, especially regarding availability, so customers aren‚Äôt left disappointed at the end of their visit."
ChIJeywJ4rMpQg0RboO8eef_bBM,5,"I really love this place! It‚Äôs a buffet but with a spin. They bring out eight dishes at a time from a 100 item menu for three rounds. Every dish was delicious from the curry chicken to all the sushi rolls, salmon tartar, gyoza, sepia a la plancha, escolar nigiri, and churrasco, just to name a few. 24 dishes at $40 a couple can‚Äôt be beat! Super cute vibe & attentive staff. A must while in Madrid!"
ChIJeywJ4rMpQg0RboO8eef_bBM,5,Great buffet! Lots of options and very fast service.
ChIJeywJ4rMpQg0RboO8eef_bBM,5,"Delicious sushi üç£ and soft, succulent steamed pork buns (Nikuman) set in a friendly, family style environment. My daughter and her bestie loved it! We will definitely go again. üçµ üçö"
ChIJeywJ4rMpQg0RboO8eef_bBM,4,"Good Asian Fusion restaurant in La Vaguada. Options of Japanese food - sushi, sashimi, temaki, rolls."
ChIJb80WdpkpQg0RULAExtvrcrg,1,"After working four days in a pizzeria of this company I decided to leave because they are unpresentable, they hire you as a delivery person and your duties are to deliver, prepare the dishwasher, sweep the store, etc... The schedules they give you are laughable, truly a shame of a job, nor does it seem hygienically very correct for an uncle or aunt who is delivering on the street and since they lack people in the kitchen, they tell you come prepare tomatoes, dough, etc... I will never eat a pizza again in any of them. of these stores. Then on the other hand they complain that there are no workers with seniority but if it is normal in the interview they tell you one thing and then it is another reality, what a shame. On top of that, to get paid you have to walk behind them because the attendants they have are the least professional there is in the hospitality industry."
ChIJb80WdpkpQg0RULAExtvrcrg,1,"After almost an hour I ask where the pizzas are and they answer that what are they for making them?
11:00 p.m. and my daughters without dinner so we went to the Burger King that is on the same street and without time problems we will not forget"
ChIJb80WdpkpQg0RULAExtvrcrg,4,"Good place but the service could be a little better, there is a super arrogant cashier...."
ChIJb80WdpkpQg0RULAExtvrcrg,2,"The place smelled bad, dirty tables, poor service, I don't recommend it."
ChIJb80WdpkpQg0RULAExtvrcrg,5,Very good pizza and service
ChIJTbgIB5wpQg0R9xcFYP6r_cU,5,"Today we decided to have lunch here. I am pleasantly impressed!!! It's very tasty here, the staff is pleasant, the order was not long to wait, despite the fact that there were people. Pizza ""Gourmet"", potatoes and another aperitif were very tasty, we took cola and fanta for our meal (they are not diluted and do not give off chlorine)

If you are tired of burgers, you want to eat tasty and cheap - be sure to come here.
Thanks!ü•∞"
ChIJTbgIB5wpQg0R9xcFYP6r_cU,1,"First of all, the treatment by the waitress was disastrous; bad faces and laughter towards clients. On the other hand, the food left a lot to be desired, with a carbonara bathed in pepper and chewy pasta. Finally, an exorbitant price in relation to the dishes served and the service."
ChIJTbgIB5wpQg0R9xcFYP6r_cU,5,"Great food, great price.
Enjoyed it."
ChIJTbgIB5wpQg0R9xcFYP6r_cU,4,"Delicious pizza and fast delivery. Ordered vegetarian Hortelana pizza - it was tasty. I recommend. And yes, its cheap, paid 6 euros including delivery charges when ordering via uber eats.
The only problem was that pizza was a bit cold by the time it arrived."
ChIJTbgIB5wpQg0R9xcFYP6r_cU,3,"A fast food restaurant that eats pasta and pizz a at a VERY cheap price, I've never seen a cheapest pasta place, 3.5‚Ç¨ for pasta? However it tastes just so so. But it's a fast food restaurant, so if you are in a hurry, just come over and order something to eat~ You can add the ingredients as you like, and the price is not expensive."
ChIJu56oNGUpQg0Rpsjt99GVYAw,5,Loved this place! My boyfriend and I were only in town for 4 days but we were impressed with the food and service the first time that we had to go back. Especially for the cheesecake that is lightly melted to perfection and the Chulet√≥n De Ternera. The food tasted very fresh and flavorful and the staff was welcoming and very kind.
ChIJu56oNGUpQg0Rpsjt99GVYAw,5,"Super nice food and passionate, great people who make and serve it"
ChIJu56oNGUpQg0Rpsjt99GVYAw,4,"Very nice place although its location is not prime. I had the ""pulpo a feira"" and ""chuleton gallego"" and they were both exquisite. Price is a bit on the high side but worth it given the quality of the food. Service might get a bit slow at a certain moment."
ChIJu56oNGUpQg0Rpsjt99GVYAw,4,"The staff are friendly and attentive, we went late afternoon so very quiet and not busy. I had Monkfish which was well cooked although my husbands steak was very small. Our desserts were lovely but I did think that the main courses were overpriced for what actually were served."
ChIJu56oNGUpQg0Rpsjt99GVYAw,3,Good restaurant with great service.
ChIJc7mzDXkpQg0RPKHDgagFx2o,5,"Excellent Galician food and
Excellent customer services at a reasonable price."
ChIJc7mzDXkpQg0RPKHDgagFx2o,3,"Good food but foxy staff.

I visited this restaurant with my boyfriend one day before we left Spain. The service was okay. They served two small dry bread pieces when we sat down. We only realized those were 3 when the bill came.We also only asked for tap water but they still charged for the bottle of still water.

Those little tricks won‚Äôt bring them anything but disappointment.

Apart from that, the paella was the best I‚Äôve ever had."
ChIJc7mzDXkpQg0RPKHDgagFx2o,4,Good service and after meal complementary aperitif üëç
ChIJc7mzDXkpQg0RPKHDgagFx2o,5,Good food
ChIJc7mzDXkpQg0RPKHDgagFx2o,5,"Very nice restaurant, with very delicious and abundant food. Everything we try is always very good, and the service is exceptional. Good value for money. Highly recommended!"
ChIJ614bSGUpQg0RwBH4fBg7Q9U,5,"Great place to grab a delicious burger and to start the night with a few drinks afterwards. There is the option to customise your burger with a different choice of breads and meats.
Service was very attentive and adequate.
This is one of my favourite places for a good quality burger in Madrid."
ChIJ614bSGUpQg0RwBH4fBg7Q9U,5,"If you want to treat yourself a delicious burger I recommend the cowboy burger. It was so delicious if I had room for one more I would have eaten another one. I washed it down with a chocolate brownie, I then went on a food coma."
ChIJ614bSGUpQg0RwBH4fBg7Q9U,5,"Long story how we ended up here, but glad we did. Great food, wonderful service, reasonable prices."
ChIJ614bSGUpQg0RwBH4fBg7Q9U,2,"First of all, we are vegetarian, so don't expect something extravagant.
we ordered vegetarian burger and pizza.
The burger together with the french fries was cold. Then they bring it back to the kitchen reheat it. Instead of replacing it (I think it got reheat in the microwave or so, because the fries that I just bite was still there...but tiny bit warmer).

The pizza was burned on the edges.
And then, when we want to finish up. They relocate us. They said it was so we can enjoy some drinks in the bar. When we arrived at the bar, there were no space available so we have stand in the corridor/the serving way.
Once we are seated, my friend order normal coffee (americano) and got espresso instead.

I think the location is cozy, but the service and the cooking needs some improvements."
ChIJ614bSGUpQg0RwBH4fBg7Q9U,5,One of the best burger if not the best ones I've tasted in my life. The staff were also great.
ChIJF6vfDXkpQg0RO7rn9nXpfdQ,1,So
ChIJF6vfDXkpQg0RO7rn9nXpfdQ,1,"I really would have read the reviews before ordering.
OUTRAGEOUS! I am Peruvian and I know the flavor of my country, and it really is not.
A chicken broth that looked like Chinese broth, had a totally out of place flavor, I requested lemon and it didn't arrive either, where it is vital that for the chicken broth I have lemon and Chinese onion or parsley that I have seen in other places that at least give you. But nothing here, and I didn't eat the dried chicken, it seemed like they had kept it for a long time, I didn't eat it out of fear (since I had an infection a few days ago) and I didn't want something to happen to me, because in that case they would have had serious problems. I lost a sausage, I recognize that nothing will be like in my country, but what they gave me is a shame. It's really tasteless, bad taste, everything bad. And the leche de tigre, outrageous, has nothing to do with the Peruvian flavor.
Improve the food, and because honestly it is horrible. I had to eat a kebab.
I would not go to this restaurant, I do not recommend that you go, nor do you order by application. It totally sucks!"
ChIJF6vfDXkpQg0RO7rn9nXpfdQ,1,"Well, how stupid I was that I didn't read the reviews before ordering through Glovo, the food is disgusting, sour taste, bad smell, it's not fresh, look at the photo I posted, this restaurant is a danger to public health, I It's normal that those from Glovo returned the pendant to me, if I had eaten that food, tonight I would be admitted to the hospital for poisoning..."
ChIJF6vfDXkpQg0RO7rn9nXpfdQ,1,"Don't order anything here it's really bad!!
The food was in a deplorable state of quality, the spoiled fish smelled really bad and I better not mention the chili‚Ä¶ the result was all rubbish. I asked for jus it and they are not responsible for anything, they refer me to the restaurant that, far from taking responsibility, sends me away‚Ä¶ seriously, this site is a scam. DON'T ASK
Look at more comments everyone says the same thing.
For now, ‚Ç¨45 has been stolen from me."
ChIJF6vfDXkpQg0RO7rn9nXpfdQ,1,"The last meal. They sent me corn with cheese and the cheese is stale, its bitter taste as if expired. I will never ask again"
ChIJF90yPZspQg0R12go0ZINHnw,4,"Went there twice‚Ä¶ the first time loved it‚Ä¶ fast and great food‚Ä¶ the second time, waited over 2 hours to get my food!"
ChIJF90yPZspQg0R12go0ZINHnw,5,"This is a very good place!! We had the pleasure to visiting in this place, excellent service and delicious food! Thank you‚ô°"
ChIJF90yPZspQg0R12go0ZINHnw,1,"A pity. I loved the food here, I always ordered through Just Eat. After 5 orders, I had already accumulated 5 stamps on my stamp card to enjoy a good discount on my next order, but my surprise was that the restaurant kept canceling all my orders. After three tries, I gave up. After the first failed attempt, I called the restaurant and they told me that it was Just Eat's fault, that they had nothing to do with it. The next time they canceled me, the phone number. from the restaurant to complain had magically disappeared. In short, the restaurant refuses to redeem the discount for me. To me and I understand that to other users. They have lost a loyal customer. It's a shame that they would rather lose a customer than redeem a measly stamp card. Terrible customer service, they only care about money."
ChIJF90yPZspQg0R12go0ZINHnw,5,"Please congratulate the chef, I have ordered about 6 times through the just eat application and those that are missing... flavor, product, kindness, punctuality... I don't usually give 5 stars unless they really and sincerely impress me It is a pleasure to have such efficient businesses near my house. The preparation time is long but if I have to wait for this meal, I'll wait as long as it takes! Keep working the same and don't even think about lowering the quality and especially that smile when delivering the food. THANK YOU!"
ChIJF90yPZspQg0R12go0ZINHnw,5,"Very attentive service with tasty food.
We ordered a potato dog with mayonnaise that we recommend one hundred percent!!"
ChIJJVM_8J4pQg0RZkqmHelz9kM,5,A place to visit if you want to eat meat and other amazing food. This place with indoor and outdoor tables offers a wide variety of meat options. During winter and summer they have a menu with the meat that includes hot soup or tomato soup (winter/summer) in addition to salad and fried potatoes. Every day you could taste the great homemade ‚Äúpincho de tortilla‚Äù and many other choices. Good wine and beer options too. Not to forget about the hamburguers with a 2x1 promotion from Sunday to Thursday.
ChIJJVM_8J4pQg0RZkqmHelz9kM,5,"Great food with really good service.
Amazing food and really well made steaks. All served by really nice and friendly staff. Location is OK, and the place is well kept and nice looking."
ChIJJVM_8J4pQg0RZkqmHelz9kM,5,Great food and wine and friendly service. Cannot wait to get there again soon.
ChIJJVM_8J4pQg0RZkqmHelz9kM,5,This is hands down the best steakhouse I‚Äôve ever attended in my life. I‚Äôm an a foreigner and I came here with my friend who is a local. The owner himself showed us so much hospitality and the food itself was the best beef I‚Äôve ever eaten. I had a burger and it‚Äôs better than any burger I‚Äôve had in america. A must stop for locals and tourists alike.
ChIJJVM_8J4pQg0RZkqmHelz9kM,5,"Good food, good service. Much better than I expected. Doesn't deserve the one and two star ratings in my opinion. One of the best value for money places that I've been to in Madrid. Certainly didn't come away hungry."
ChIJi5lsqXkpQg0RK6J0TKGI6C4,5,"Great local bar, staff friendly, good food.  If visiting the area worth a stop for a drink."
ChIJi5lsqXkpQg0RK6J0TKGI6C4,5,Our family loved the breakfast and coffee in a historic square.
ChIJi5lsqXkpQg0RK6J0TKGI6C4,5,top top top
ChIJi5lsqXkpQg0RK6J0TKGI6C4,5,"The food is very good, it has a large terrace that is great. Super nice waitress
Great price for the quality - quantity"
ChIJi5lsqXkpQg0RK6J0TKGI6C4,5,"Excellent place to eat portions of very good quality and quantity!
The potatoes are not oily and well done, the fried eggs with ham are delicious and with a good amount of ham, which is appreciated.
The pleasant waiters and the cook, too. It is obvious that they care about their customers and knowing if everything has been fine.
Without a doubt, a place to return toüòä"
ChIJVyU8Ld8pQg0RkSMbB-v33vk,5,"Good cuisine with excellent service performance. The taste of salads, and shellfishes will move you from Madrid to Galicia just closing your eyes. I seriously recoment this place for all those people are visiting Madrid and want delicious food with good price."
ChIJVyU8Ld8pQg0RkSMbB-v33vk,5,Great food. Friendly owners. Love from Romania!
ChIJVyU8Ld8pQg0RkSMbB-v33vk,5,"Exceptional product, exquisite cuisine, efficient service.
It has added a lot to the brand that the new location is larger.
We were already your customers in the old location and we will continue to be in this one."
ChIJVyU8Ld8pQg0RkSMbB-v33vk,5,"After several visits and overcoming the adaptation due to a change of location, it can be said that it is a place where quality and product go hand in hand and the service is pleasant. Everything we have tried is at a high level (octopus, artichokes, cockles, pink tomato salad, prawns, cuttlefish, squid, coquinas, anchovies, hamburger, fish of the day, etc...). Perhaps what we liked the least was the rice dishes, but honestly with the variety of fish, seafood and meats we don't mind. Good quality-price ratio considering the product. There was a need for a restaurant like this in the neighborhood."
ChIJVyU8Ld8pQg0RkSMbB-v33vk,5,"Maravilloso!!
Celebramos una despedida de jubilaci√≥n y elegimos el men√∫ de 40 euros y todo un acierto. Fue todo un detalle que nos pusieron en las mesas unos embutidos para que los que llegaran antes fueran picando algo y muy buenos, por cierto. De los entrantes, la ensalada de tomate con ventresca muy rica, las croquetas espectaculares y los mejillones para no parar de mojar en la salsa.
Los platos principales, por un lado fue lubina y por otro entrecot, tanto de cantidad como de calidad, sin palabras de verdad, buen√≠simo todo.
Nos pusieron unos chupitos muy ricos y un postre tipo milhoja que madre miaaaa...
Muchas gracias a Juan, David, Alfonso y demas compa√±eros que lo organizaron todo de maravilla y por supuesto a Luis que en cocina hizo un magn√≠fico trabajo."
ChIJHey1pGwpQg0R2cmWOwyfWwU,5,I have bought several times and everything is very tasty. You can tell that they cook it right there every day and at a very good price.   A place like this was missing in the neighborhood.  And the employee Susi is very nice.
ChIJHey1pGwpQg0R2cmWOwyfWwU,4,"Everything is very delicious, we have already bought 3-4 times and everything is good. The only negative is the price: two small plates and a drink cost the same as a menu of the day in a restaurant, and in the restaurant they give you dessert."
ChIJHey1pGwpQg0R2cmWOwyfWwU,5,"New takeaway place in the Pilar neighborhood.

It looks good, we will try to try what they have when it opens"
ChIJHey1pGwpQg0R2cmWOwyfWwU,5,"I order them at home and everything arrives on time and the quality is spectacular.
Spectacular professionals."

ChIJUzjhTqopQg0RKCC6nWi9pNk,5,I had a great experience in this restaurant! I like the taste of laiwei ramen very much. I will visit this shop again on my next trip to Europe.
ChIJUzjhTqopQg0RKCC6nWi9pNk,5,"Siempre hab√≠a pasado por delante de este sitio y jam√°s lo hab√≠a probado. Hoy ha sido el d√≠a y me ha encantado! El local muy mono y acogedor, el servicio encantador y la comida muy rica! El bao de gamba estaba riqu√≠simo, las croquetas de pulpo tambi√©n y el ramen de ternera muy rico y contundente. De postre, mochi de cheesecake s√∫per bueno tambi√©n. Al haber hecho la reserva por tlf, nos han hecho un descuento del 10%. Me he quedado con ganas de probar el sushi. Volveremos seguro!"
ChIJUzjhTqopQg0RKCC6nWi9pNk,4,"Good Japanese restaurant in the Pilar neighborhood. If you like good ramen or sushi this is a good place to eat. We really liked the food, good portions, friendly and fast staff. Everything was good, I will surely repeat to try more dishes. Advisable!"
ChIJUzjhTqopQg0RKCC6nWi9pNk,5,"We loved it in ramen!!  We ordered two different ramen, one with pork and one with duck. As a starter, the gyozas are spectacular, you can tell that they are not the typical purchased ones, they are of very good quality. Lastly, dessert. We ordered a kind of chocolate cake and mathca tea ice cream. Quite light as desserts to end the dinner...Large restaurant, they have an interior room as well."

ChIJteKvj1QpQg0RLd2ixO81s_s,5,"Excellent Venezuelan food place!
Their empanadas are spectacular and they have very good promotions, very affordable prices and excellent quality.

They have a large number of traditional dishes and the service is very good and close to the public.
I highly recommend coming to eat here.

If you come on line 9, you won't have to walk more than 10 steps when leaving the Barrio del Pilar metro."
ChIJteKvj1QpQg0RLd2ixO81s_s,5,"The best HALLACAS ü´î in Madrid that we have tried!!!!  And the wonderful HAM BREAD! 10 out of 10
A cozy place to enjoy arepas and empanadas!!! Beer and a calm atmosphere! IT WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT TO COME BACK!"
ChIJteKvj1QpQg0RLd2ixO81s_s,5,"Totally delicious empanadas and with a little piece of my land as an ingredient. They were so good that even an Asian friend commented: ""The best I've ever eaten.""

Totally recommended place if you are looking for a quick and tasty breakfast."
ChIJteKvj1QpQg0RLd2ixO81s_s,5,"Last week we had breakfast at the premises. We went on the advice of some friends.
The truth is that it was a complete success.
We had chicken pastries and empanadas for breakfast, with coffees and so on.
Everything on point and delicious.
In addition to being very well attended to and giving us all kinds of explanations about everything we can taste on site, collect and order.
In addition there are also typical Spanish breakfasts.
A great success.
We will be regular customers from now on."

As others have said, I don't understand the negative comments either, it is highly recommended"
ChIJKanUX18pQg0RsCKY943pU0E,5,Absolutely amazing. The best sushi I've ever had by far. Always on time and delicious.
ChIJKanUX18pQg0RsCKY943pU0E,1,I placed a home delivery order through Glovo and the order came in poor condition. With a bad smell and bad taste and to be sushi you have to have cleanliness and quality raw materials for the health of the customers. They returned part of the order to me through Glovo and compensated me for what happened.
ChIJKanUX18pQg0RsCKY943pU0E,5,"Fantastic team, very attentive and helpful. The food is very good. A ten."
ChIJdS26OvApQg0Rru3Ykww2SA4,4,"The woman was very friendly, and with the drink a tapa... the food was also good, with a menu of the day. Good service."
ChIJdS26OvApQg0Rru3Ykww2SA4,5,"Very well prepared homemade food and very reasonable prices.
It has been a great discovery for us."
ChIJdS26OvApQg0Rru3Ykww2SA4,4,"PRETTY GOOD
If you know the Nazare wooden bar, it will seem like you are in it since they maintain the same style.
In general, it is quite good to go and have a beer. As for the portions, you should try the grilled cod, which is delicious. We were not very convinced by the croquettes.
Breakfast is good too.
Highly recommended to have a beer with a tapa, it's pretty good. As a suggestion, do not forget to put a tapa with the beers once you order some portions, because even if we order portions the tapa is good to accompany."
ChIJdS26OvApQg0Rru3Ykww2SA4,4,"Very nice places with huge portions with a Portuguese touch, very friendly treatment and good service. In an area where it is increasingly difficult to find something to eat, it is not only recommended but almost necessary to visit. I have repeated a couple of times and I have always left delighted"
ChIJdS26OvApQg0Rru3Ykww2SA4,5,"Restaurant in the Altamira area, exceptional treatment, both the owners and employees, delicious daily menu and high quality portions, you feel at home but very careful treatment and high quality food, homemade and very careful presentation. Portuguese products (Cod with Cream and Cod √° Br√°z) AWESOME!
Homemade and very delicious desserts
Highly recommended. Thanks to the team you make up and keep it up!"
ChIJAeQinhgpQg0RdlkUvJe7fps,5,"OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE. if there was one of this franchise nearby my place, i would come here every week.

recommendation: chicken karage, takoyaki, donkotsu ramen. i had a medium size and it was so plenty! there are 3 different size you can choose so feel free to adjust it up!"
ChIJAeQinhgpQg0RdlkUvJe7fps,3,"Not the most savoury japanese dish i had. Expensive for the size of the servings, and the minced beef had a shady taste and texture.
Also, muslims and jews are not going to enjoy much of this restaurant since 90% of the menu is pork based."
ChIJAeQinhgpQg0RdlkUvJe7fps,4,"It took a bit for it for to arrive, but it's understandable a it was a Sunday at lunch time.

I would have expected a bit more quantity for the price. Especially the fried rice Japanese style.

Overall it was ok, good option if you want to change your standards European flavors"
ChIJAeQinhgpQg0RdlkUvJe7fps,5,"Loved the place, great food and atmosphere"
ChIJAeQinhgpQg0RdlkUvJe7fps,5,"Super good Ramen and very friendly staff! The different sizes are nice to choose from, the toppings are good and the Ramen is served very fast! The broth is very nice, the only thing that I didn't like so much was that the fried tofu became glibbery so fast. Def coming back!"
ChIJdWYOukgpQg0RD9SC9hokDvA,5,TOP
ChIJdWYOukgpQg0RD9SC9hokDvA,1,One of the worst experiences ever! One of the most rude staff I have seen in Barrio del Pilar. Never again in my life
ChIJdWYOukgpQg0RD9SC9hokDvA,5,Super
ChIJdWYOukgpQg0RD9SC9hokDvA,2,"I ordered a large kebab box and wow, it seemed to be a normal one and apart from that the content was 80% potatoes, the truth is little content, I do not recommend ordering it."
ChIJdWYOukgpQg0RD9SC9hokDvA,3,Good kebab at the Barrio del Pilar metro exit. Adjusted prices on both food and drinks. Perhaps it penalizes you that inside the premises in summer it is very hot and that the terrace is small and is on a busy street. Ideal to carry.
ChIJL8iR0HcpQg0RKp4siX4flM4,5,"As a foreigner that has now lived in Europe years and years I'm always looking for a new place to add to my 'best of' list and I can say with no hesitation that Taberna La Ilustraci√≥n just made it to the top of that list. I have literally not had better food in years! Everything was absolutely delicious and prepared fresh to order with quality ingredients and very generous portions. I could really taste not only how quality everything was but the genuine love and care put into the food. The family environment in the restaurant was really amazing, it seemed like everyone knew each other and was super friendly. Incredibly positive and cheerful vibes all around. Alina the bartender runs the family owned restaurant with her mother and father for more than 20 years and you can really notice why it's been around for so long. Absolute top notch in every possible way. Highly recommend 10 out of 10."
ChIJL8iR0HcpQg0RKp4siX4flM4,5,"Very nice service, good wine selection and unique dishes. Try the spinach and eggs."
ChIJL8iR0HcpQg0RKp4siX4flM4,5,"The place is just awesome: a family run cosy restaurant with superb food, amazing atmosphere, very decent selection of drinks and reasonable prices. The entire family is super friendly and welcoming. We just asked to be fed and everything else was done in the most generous way in no time (a group of 10 with no advanced order!). Returned the next day - that much we loved it. Will definitely come again when next time in Madrid.
P.S. Besides Spanish delicacies, they serve burgers! Probably one of the best burgers I have tried."
ChIJL8iR0HcpQg0RKp4siX4flM4,5,"We had the most wonderful dining experience here last night - despite us speaking terrible Spanish, the lovely staff recommended beautiful food & wine. A gorgeous little restaurant, cozy atmosphere, and great food. I‚Äôm so pleased we found it, and would hurry back."
ChIJL8iR0HcpQg0RKp4siX4flM4,5,"This small taverna in Madrid is a true hidden gem that should not be missed. The food was simply outstanding, bursting with flavor and prepared with finesse. The attentive service and cozy ambiance added to the overall appeal, making it an unforgettable dining experience. If you're looking for an authentic taste of Madrid's culinary delights, seek out this small taverna, you will not regret it."
ChIJw3SC2p8pQg0R341EcjXc48c,5,"Highly recommended!!! Grab all the different flavors and you would be happy you did!!! We got ourselves almost all the flavors of these delicious, savory empanadas and they are all sooo good!!! We also purchased dulce de leche and they are perfect for bread or on its own licking your spoon full of this sweet, yummy goodnessüòä"
ChIJw3SC2p8pQg0R341EcjXc48c,5,Friendly guy I asked for best selling empanadillas and brought them and the friendly staff even gave me a gift chocolate coated raspberries thankyou! the lady outside appreciated itüòä
ChIJw3SC2p8pQg0R341EcjXc48c,5,Back in England we have pies and Cornish pasties. These empanadas are better than the best versions of either of those. These work great as a snack on the go or part of a larger meal. Going to come back for more before I leave.
ChIJw3SC2p8pQg0R341EcjXc48c,5,Best empanadas I‚Äôve had. Tried the new Trufle ones and they‚Äôre def my favourite. Hope it stays on the menu.
ChIJw3SC2p8pQg0R341EcjXc48c,5,"Perfect location. Customer service is the best. They are very friendly, definitely on my next visit to Madrid I will go to enjoy the good service."

ChIJjz9BZm8pQg0Rj16FlqO36Mg,3,"A good place to have a drink in the Barrio del Pilar. It has a large terrace that is nice to be in the shade. They take you out on the drink.

They have a varied menu, with different prices inside than on the terrace. The breakfast is acceptable and the price is very good."
ChIJLeZJeZ4pQg0RvbnbAKsM3fw,5,Magnificent breakfasts and delicious tapas. The owners are super attentive and friendly. I will definitely return.
ChIJLeZJeZ4pQg0RvbnbAKsM3fw,5,"We had a beer after the Plaza Castilla market, they gave us a tapa and it cost 1.70 a bottle. The woman is super friendly, highly recommended for a beer. Lifelong bar."
ChIJLeZJeZ4pQg0RvbnbAKsM3fw,5,Cozy place and unbeatable service. The homemade croquettes are 10! All the tapas they serve with the drink (and this already happens in few bars) are homemade and delicious. Without a doubt a bar that almost doesn't exist anymore!
ChIJLeZJeZ4pQg0RvbnbAKsM3fw,4,Pleasant family bar where you can taste good tapas with friendly service and adequate prices.
ChIJLeZJeZ4pQg0RvbnbAKsM3fw,5,It's great!! Some delicious tapas and super affordable prices. 100% recommendable
ChIJO5Fc6UcpQg0RNAOYbXPBWPA,3,"I love coming here almost every break from work. The service has been excellent, servers are very friendly. However,  Just today, I‚Äôve ordered a chamomile tea that is quite old o guess, because it has these tiny insects crawling out from my cup. Good thing i saw it first before I put hot water. So I asked for another one, & it was still the same. The tea bag was full of live insects. I asked for another flavour - green tea & it was good. No insects. I have been asking for tea for a long time. This probably my last."
ChIJO5Fc6UcpQg0RNAOYbXPBWPA,5,"Love it ‚Ä¶ healthy and tasty food.
Cozy, modern relaxing atmosphere and impeccable service.
Great value for money. Definitely not the last time here."
ChIJO5Fc6UcpQg0RNAOYbXPBWPA,5,Secrets Vaguada is my favorite restaurant in the La Vaguada mall. They have a decent amount of main and side combinations that will definitely fill you up. Their coffee selection is good too. I'd recommend going for the Thai Sweet and Sour Chicken as well as the Cafe con leche.
ChIJO5Fc6UcpQg0RNAOYbXPBWPA,5,"Definitely recommended, a wonderful restaurant and coffee shop with amazing mouth watering and delicious food. Inside is very nicely designed which gives a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. I had the steak with sweet potato chips and spinach salad. The meat was fresh and well made. The dressing for salad and chips was so delicious. Top notch place after a nice shopping in La-vaguada."
ChIJO5Fc6UcpQg0RNAOYbXPBWPA,4,"Newly opened cafe in centro comercial la vaguada.
Had tried almost every cafe there but this one was something interesting.
They have a wide variety of desserts and cafe.
Also, they have healthy drinks.
The seating arrangement is very cute and cozy. It was very comfortable.
Vibes were good with good music playing.
The coffee and croissant was good.
This cute little cafe is a good top place after a bout of shopping at la vaguada.
Must needed place as all the other caf√©s there are always full with limited seating. Definitely going back for mire coffee!!"
ChIJ3SAE5i4pQg0Rfx-64fSO3w0,1,"I share the opinion that exists.  I have never been to this place with these owners. I liked the ones that were before.
Right now as a worker I can't sleep because this bar is noisy at night.  They have children playing ball or screaming at night.  You cannot have the window open in the heat of the day so as not to have to put up with this poor management.
I hope things change and that they respect."
ChIJ3SAE5i4pQg0Rfx-64fSO3w0,5,"I am very surprised by the reviews, especially those about the food, because everything I have tried was created with great care and dedication. As for the noise, every time I have been there the hours have been respected, a different thing will be if people do not accept the business hours established by law and only come in handy when they are the ones at the bar. And those who miss the previous ones, will they be the same ones who denounced them several times? I am also unpleasantly surprised by 6 or 7 negative comments on the same line within 6 hours, I think it is a fake."
ChIJ3SAE5i4pQg0Rfx-64fSO3w0,5,"Good evening to me, one of the cleanest bars with the best food and service in the Pilar neighborhood and I have not met people like those who are there now. Friendly, clean and with better cooking knowledge, they should be in a chef from San Sebastian. Anyway, there are very bitter people in this neighborhood, where I was born and have been for 44 years. For children, there are places for adults only. I see everything very organized... In 6 hours 6 comments, and everyone loved the previous owners, but they still receive complaints."
ChIJ3SAE5i4pQg0Rfx-64fSO3w0,1,Noisy. They do not respect schedules at night. I went to eat there and it was disgusting.  The ones before these were nicer.  They are dirtying Carballo Square.
ChIJ3SAE5i4pQg0Rfx-64fSO3w0,1,"Bad food, full of grease and an unpleasant atmosphere. When you go out all you want is to have a good time, but what you hear are the screams and cries of children.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT"
ChIJDWPPUZ4pQg0RiUGfRn_b2JY,5,"The best terrace in the entire neighborhood. You can come with your dog, they have a Galicia star, and a fan with a water spray that is wonderful. The food is amazing and the waiters make you feel at home. Best beer of the summer."
ChIJDWPPUZ4pQg0RiUGfRn_b2JY,5,"The ear is very good and the brave ones too, they put a lot in everything and are very well priced"
ChIJDWPPUZ4pQg0RiUGfRn_b2JY,4,"They treated me quickly, the service was efficient, small but cozy to eat alone or with others."
ChIJDWPPUZ4pQg0RiUGfRn_b2JY,5,"Neighborhood bar, good prices, large terrace with huge television, charming waiters, great tapas. Tercios/doubles ‚Ç¨2.5 glasses of very good brands ‚Ç¨6.
They let you take a speaker and play whatever music you want.
The terrace is at the back and for summer it is 10.
Totally recommended."
ChIJDWPPUZ4pQg0RiUGfRn_b2JY,1,"The attention leaves a lot to be desired, and to make matters worse, it took them an hour to bring me the complaint form, which they refused to fill out."
ChIJiyu8PnopQg0R4EUVfewfGLU,5,"The best tacos al pastor in Madrid, authentic, good flavors. Guacamole is prepared on demand. I  also recommend the Stella Artois üç∫"
ChIJiyu8PnopQg0R4EUVfewfGLU,5,Delicious mexican food and drinks. Nice personel. For sure place worth to visit again.
ChIJiyu8PnopQg0R4EUVfewfGLU,5,An amazing little Mexican place in the neighbourhood! The food is made on the spot including the guacamole and the naxos! The fajitas are very good and the quesadillas even better! There is also Mexican beer to add to the environment even though its not amazing! In any case highly recommended!
ChIJiyu8PnopQg0R4EUVfewfGLU,5,Amazing authentic Mexican cooking. Really enjoyed both visits this Christmas. Unfortunately I neglected to get a coffee afterwards...heard it's very good! ¬°Yummy ¬Æ!
ChIJiyu8PnopQg0R4EUVfewfGLU,5,Best tacos I've had in a long time
ChIJq3pGwPYpQg0RuH36DePLQpk,5,Amazing place and good service and food
ChIJq3pGwPYpQg0RuH36DePLQpk,5,"Great little bakery with freshly baked products at regular prices. The small croissants (butter and chocolate) are tondoe for, specially when warm!"
ChIJq3pGwPYpQg0RuH36DePLQpk,5,"Nice bakery, also for lovers of Venezuelan food they have empanadas and teque√±os, don't forget to order the guasacaca, it's too good. My friend Preiden was on point, excellent service, I recommend 100%"
ChIJq3pGwPYpQg0RuH36DePLQpk,5,"Preiddy's attention was phenomenal and the empanadas, cachitos and Venezuelan teque√±os were delicious, good coffee and drinks to accompany. Recommended"
ChIJq3pGwPYpQg0RuH36DePLQpk,5,"Me encanta esta panader√≠a, adem√°s de vender muy buenos panes hecho con dedicaci√≥n, tienen comida venezolana y todo hecho con cari√±o üëå"
ChIJw9XfHf4pQg0RyFULEjmEwqc,5,"Lovely small spot with friendly servers and delicious food.  Fixed two-course lunch menu offered from 13-1530, tapas available for dinner. Highly recommend the artichoke with ham (Alcachofas con jam√≥n ib√©rico y salsa romesco)"
ChIJw9XfHf4pQg0RyFULEjmEwqc,5,"ADVISABLE

I discovered this vermouth shop that opened about three months ago and the truth is that I loved it. The terrace is super pleasant, ideal for having a quiet drink and being able to choose between sun and shade as you like.
Special mention to the head waiter, he is very professional and always makes sure that everything is perfect, that you get what you ordered, etc.
They have a wide variety of vermouths, even on tap, and they make the tap beer very cool, I understand that it is thanks to the mega barrels of Mahou that they have.

The best thing is that with each drink they bring you an appetizer that is delicious, and the maitre d' told us that his idea is to always offer a good aperitif. A hoot.
From what we tried from the menu, the anchovy gildas, the deconstructed smoked sardine gilda and the belly belly salad with anchovy mayonnaise were very delicious.

In short, a great place in the neighborhood, much better than what was there before. I hope they do very well, because I plan to continue going to enjoy their little terrace.

Comment/request: It would be great if you opened a little earlier on the weekend to have coffee/breakfast!"
ChIJw9XfHf4pQg0RyFULEjmEwqc,4,"We found the venue's proposal charming. It is ideal to sit on the terrace and enjoy a beer and a snack. The tapas were very good and are different from what you can try in the rest of the neighborhood. To put it another way, the service was a bit slow and we had to wait a long time."
ChIJw9XfHf4pQg0RyFULEjmEwqc,5,"We loved this visit to this traditional tavern.
1. Barrel of mahou and tap vermouth from Zarro. The Madrid products are a great success.
2. Everything we ordered was delicious, the gildas, the mussels with fries, the croquettes (we ordered a variety) and the broken eggs.
3. Very good service and good atmosphere. It has a space inside and a very nice terrace.
Good value for money, it's about time they put a place like this in the neighborhood. Keep going like this!"
ChIJw9XfHf4pQg0RyFULEjmEwqc,4,"A culinary experience that exceeds expectations thanks to the incredible talent of the cook. Each dish was exquisite, but the torrija was the star of the night: simply divine, with a perfect texture and a flavor that leaves you speechless. In addition, the service was first class, with a team that was always attentive and friendly. Without a doubt, this is a place that I recommend to anyone looking for exceptional food and a cozy atmosphere. Looking forward to coming back to try more!"
ChIJv1KYamkpQg0RhbSqhk2U9BA,4,Nice... good rest. Has a excellent coffee corner... please bw aware... interior door closes as 20:00 pm.. to cold for a terrace... but big. So all in all good experience
ChIJv1KYamkpQg0RhbSqhk2U9BA,4,"We (4 of us) went to this place just after our Covid vaccine @Hosp LaPaz in the mid morning of Saturday, last July 3, 2021 to have our light snacks.
I found the place bigger and tidier compared to other McDonald's branches.
It was my first time to use their digital ordering machine and was amazed because it was so pretty easy üòç ...I was hesitant before to use that machine because of fear üòÅ glad to have that experience and maybe next time, I will do it again!"
ChIJv1KYamkpQg0RhbSqhk2U9BA,1,"I've had a big order and they didn't put all my ordered food. Also when I have ordered at the touch screen, I didn't get my number and when I have shown my payment receipt, they were not able to relate to the order so I had to tell them all my order. This is lame..."
ChIJv1KYamkpQg0RhbSqhk2U9BA,3,"Quick service but paper bags for coffee break easily!  Fast breakfast ordered egg mcmuffin with bacon, and coffee. Food was fine."
ChIJv1KYamkpQg0RhbSqhk2U9BA,2,"It's a McDonald's... So they dutifully follow the Global Policy of being incapable of either getting your order correct or delivering fast food quickly! But it's no better or worse than any McDonald's across the globe: if you like it then go, if you don't then don't! ü§£"
ChIJvXBWKWkpQg0RUkq3lQA4Z-c,5,"So this place is like a cafeteria, you come in and grab a tray ‚Ä¶there are two  registers, one is for a quick pick up and the one in the back is more extensive for customers dining in, but you can go to whichever area has a shorter line. The lady at the register was super nice and super attentive‚Ä¶made sure I had napkins, offered me every variety of sugar for my coffee .. very friendly. And the food and coffee are better than McDonald‚Äôs which is next door and your only other option."
ChIJvXBWKWkpQg0RUkq3lQA4Z-c,4,This is a self service cafeteria with good food and prices. If you happen to be in the area then this is a good bang for your money.
ChIJvXBWKWkpQg0RUkq3lQA4Z-c,1,Thieves
ChIJvXBWKWkpQg0RUkq3lQA4Z-c,1,No coments...
ChIJvXBWKWkpQg0RUkq3lQA4Z-c,5,"Fantastic service, good cleanliness and homemade food, for a pleasant break from the hospital. There is a lack of gluten-free and/or meat or cheese-free options, so it is not such a good option for vegans or vegetarians. I congratulate the team of this restaurant, for making the stay at this restaurant happy."
ChIJHwso6RcpQg0RJMp5N5q_c-Q,5,"We found it by chance,  exploring the area! It s 5 minutes walking near the Towers. You could find traditional meals, great atmosphere,  good service , the menu is also in English!"
ChIJHwso6RcpQg0RJMp5N5q_c-Q,5,"The margarita and the food were really good. We also ordered a white wine sangria jar and it was amazing. Everything came pretty fast, and the servers were very kind and respectful. Will definetely come back, and the atmosphere is welcoming."
ChIJHwso6RcpQg0RJMp5N5q_c-Q,5,Great food and friendly staff. Especially chicken was awesome.
ChIJHwso6RcpQg0RJMp5N5q_c-Q,5,"Great welcome!
We have been welcomed in a warm way and escorted to the table very nice and tidy. Carlos the waiter has been very attentive kind and made us happy by delivering great food :)

Definitely a place to be!"
ChIJHwso6RcpQg0RJMp5N5q_c-Q,4,"Not a bad place for food and drinks. The space is beautiful and the service is great, however all of the Spanish omelette was under seasoned and the steak was chewy ‚Ä¶"
ChIJ0RjTQB4pQg0Rmwf_u0xWX64,4,I really loved the decoration and ambience of this restaurant located in the 5 tower business center. It is much better than the noisy and older ornella in velazquez street. Food is good but not top notch. I was disappointed by the cream based carbonara pasta and the overcooked guanciale on top of it hence my 4 stars instead of 5. Service was excellent and super efficient. Overall very good place to visit after shopping or to hold business lunch meeting at caleido.
ChIJ0RjTQB4pQg0Rmwf_u0xWX64,5,"I went to this restaurant on Sunday night and let me tell you, it was a success. From the beginning, the manager Estefania gave us a warm welcome and we spent the rest of our time there with Jusmir who from minute 1 made us feel at home with her kindness and her excellent attention at all times. As a plus she's bilingual. We will definitely come back!"
ChIJ0RjTQB4pQg0Rmwf_u0xWX64,5,"Really great food, experience, service! We had team lunch, we were a big group and they delivered an exceptional service."
ChIJ0RjTQB4pQg0Rmwf_u0xWX64,5,"Ornella at Caleido Madrid brings a slice of Italy to the city with a modern twist. From the moment you walk in, you‚Äôre greeted with a warm, sophisticated ambiance‚Äîa blend of rustic Italian charm and contemporary elegance.

Service is spot-on. Jusmir and Roel made our experience exceptional. They know the menu inside out and recommended dishes that were absolute hits. Friendly yet professional, they made us feel like regulars, ensuring everything was perfectly timed without hovering.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the food. We started with the Burrata Pugliese, a creamy indulgence that‚Äôs beautifully balanced with a side of marinated tomatoes and basil. For the mains, the Pizza Diavola, was a great choice with a perfectly charred, thin crust and fresh, generous toppings.

Dessert was the Tiramisu della Casa, which managed to be light yet satisfyingly rich‚Äîa must-try to finish the meal. The wine selection complements the menu well, offering a range of Italian wines to pair with every dish.

Ornella is an experience worth repeating, thanks to the skilled kitchen, excellent service by Jusmir and Roel, and a welcoming atmosphere that invites you to linger a bit longer. Perfect for both a casual dinner or a special night out."
ChIJ0RjTQB4pQg0Rmwf_u0xWX64,5,"Jusmir is an incredible waitress, very kind and helpful! The pomodoro was also delicious."
ChIJccJC_IcpQg0RPad1gtsAK5w,5,"Fantastic! Normally, I am not a big sushi fan.  But.. we came here, were greeted sat and then they explained the menu, the options, gave some recommendations.

We ordered a mixed selection, which was  amazing!

Very impressed.. fresh, tasty.. Fantastic.

The whole place is nice with indoor/outdoor seating.  Big menu, lots of choice and friendly staff (we were served by a nice lady whose name began with K - sorry i forgot!!).

Price is good too. Will definitely come back."
ChIJccJC_IcpQg0RPad1gtsAK5w,5,"This is an amazing place, both for a romantic dinner as well as dinner out with friends.
Everything I have tried is so tasty and well presented.
Dishes size is very decent, not small neither large, I think they are just perfect.
Stuff is very friendly and looks after clientele without being annoying.
Decoration creates a cozy and welcoming environment.
The price is reasonable.
All in all, really good, and definitely a place I would like to come back to next time I‚Äôm in town."
ChIJccJC_IcpQg0RPad1gtsAK5w,5,Delicious and creative sushi! The flavors were amazing!
ChIJccJC_IcpQg0RPad1gtsAK5w,2,"Ambiance is good but food is nothing special so many better places exist around the same price for sushi.
And unfortunately we both had digestional discomfort after this place.
Service was soo slow we thought about leaving several times while waiting for the food."
ChIJccJC_IcpQg0RPad1gtsAK5w,5,"Highly recommend üëå
Welcoming atmosphere
Delicious food
Thank Alberto for service"
ChIJAQUNfsgpQg0RjXocXu4kCqA,5,"Loved it!

Really tasty tacos, with warm and friendly service. We ordered a selection of tacos to share and they were all fresh and full of flavour. Excellent value, too. We would most certainly return!"
ChIJAQUNfsgpQg0RjXocXu4kCqA,5,"We‚Äôre there in my birthday, stopped there by chance, and was worth it! It‚Äôs been the best Mexican food I ever ate!!! Staff were awesome and beers were cold, simply GREAT!"
ChIJAQUNfsgpQg0RjXocXu4kCqA,5,"Very tasty tacos, fantasy customer service. Very reasonably priced. Some more vet able sides or options would be a plus"
ChIJAQUNfsgpQg0RjXocXu4kCqA,3,"Great guac, but then not much else if you don‚Äôt eat meat. No fish tacos üò¢ and the mushroom tacos were kind of gloppy and overstuffed. I had them add cheese (come on! We‚Äôre not all vegans!) but man, I‚Äôd be in there a lot more if they added on some decent fish tacos."
ChIJAQUNfsgpQg0RjXocXu4kCqA,2,"Everything was very dry, even the quesadilla was dry and cheese not melted. Tacos were very disappointing. Margarita was ok but a little pricey at ‚Ç¨12. Maybe we timed it badly as it was a bank holiday, waiter was nice so it‚Äôs a 2 and not a 1.  Won‚Äôt be back!"
ChIJ4wvNTeApQg0RK4aTR7qhw-k,4,"Great, efficient and friendly service. Although being a music restaurant it needs to improve the music equipment. The amp, the mixer, the EQ and speakers. The food is delicious and Cesar outperforms ."
ChIJ4wvNTeApQg0RK4aTR7qhw-k,5,"We visit this place Friday's night and had a great time. They have live music, the food is good, and the atmosphre was great."
ChIJ4wvNTeApQg0RK4aTR7qhw-k,5,I was in Madrid for the first time and had my best torrezno here
ChIJ4wvNTeApQg0RK4aTR7qhw-k,4,"Good place for late drinks, but the locker in the restroom is broken"
ChIJ4wvNTeApQg0RK4aTR7qhw-k,5,Amazing experience! Great service!
ChIJNcQKSYUpQg0Rqki_AOda0Jc,5,"Empanadas were amazing, I especially liked the carne suave one. Cappuccino is decent, considering it costs less than one euro in a menu, it is good. Great space for a quick bite"
ChIJNcQKSYUpQg0Rqki_AOda0Jc,5,Delicious empanadas with very friendly personnel. She guided me with the variety of empanadas and gave me detailed recommendations. My personal favourite was chorizo picante. The place was also nice. Highly recommended.
ChIJNcQKSYUpQg0Rqki_AOda0Jc,5,"You just cannot go wrong with this place! The empanadas are a real treat, excellent way to get a working lunch or even pack for a family picnic. I‚Äôd recommend picking up the empanadas yourself so you get to pick from the deli and the staff are always so friendly and helpful with the infinite choices available."
ChIJNcQKSYUpQg0Rqki_AOda0Jc,3,"Re-heated frosted empanadas, pretty much sums it up."
ChIJNcQKSYUpQg0Rqki_AOda0Jc,5,"Empanadas¬†were really great, we took some of them take away and after trying it we came back there for more and the lady working there was very¬†kind, and¬†she speaks¬†English¬†very well,¬†strongly¬†recommend this place!"
ChIJd-vuxRIpQg0RTidrO5LKkss,5,"Hands down the best fast food place in Spain.
I would totally suggest to get the bacon cheese burger to start with and some small fries. The portion of the fries are always super big, which is one of the biggest reasons that I love five guys.
Plus, the peanuts and unlimited mayo and ketchup. This place has it all.
Amazing service, the staff is always very positive. You can tell that they actually hired quality people to work here.

The only suggestion that I have is that, they can have a person cleaning the tables more frequent. I've been there multiple times and every time I see leftovers of food or just dirty tables. But it's not that terrible."
ChIJd-vuxRIpQg0RTidrO5LKkss,1,"As a tourist that stayed in the near by hotel, today got a terrible experience.
I‚Äôve ordered from this restaurant during my stay almost every day and it was amazing, the staff spoke English and even when they didn‚Äôt we worked our way through.
Today I walked in said hello and asked if I could order a milkshake while I was saying what kind of milkshake I wanted I got interrupted by the cashier, she said that I need to order in Spanish( I understand a little bit of Spanish but I can‚Äôt talk in it)
So I asked if she speaks English and her response was ‚ÄúNo, we are in Spain, I don‚Äôt need to speak English‚Äù the women was very rude, she even raised her voice at me and gave an attitude.
Of course after an interaction like this I didn‚Äôt even order and during my stay I don‚Äôt even wanna go back there.
It‚Äôs weird, because the restaurant is an American restaurant, the interior of the restaurant has English posters up, they also have menus in English and even the outside signs are in English and the restaurant is near by a hotel where everyone speaks English.
I understand she might not know English, but why did she had to be so rude about it?
If she has a problem with tourists she should work in a different location not right next to a hotel."
ChIJd-vuxRIpQg0RTidrO5LKkss,5,The Five Guys experience with a nice terrace
ChIJd-vuxRIpQg0RTidrO5LKkss,5,Very good service. Received my food fast and the place is very clean.
ChIJd-vuxRIpQg0RTidrO5LKkss,5,Great place with great staff. Burgers and hotdogs are delicious 10/10
ChIJQyxJR38pQg0R2Hgf2_-FU6c,5,"An unforgettable experience at Bareto Caleido! The service was absolutely amazing, and the food was simply incredible‚Äîevery dish was a delight. A special shoutout to Emilio, who was a very, very, very lovely guy. His kindness and attention made the experience even more special. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back!"
ChIJQyxJR38pQg0R2Hgf2_-FU6c,1,"Waiters avoided serving the outside tables. One of them even looked at us acknowledged us then proceeded to ignore us for 15 minutes.
After 30 minutes we left"
ChIJQyxJR38pQg0R2Hgf2_-FU6c,5,Ra√∫l did a great job. Very good atmosphere!
ChIJQyxJR38pQg0R2Hgf2_-FU6c,5,Very good food and atmosphere. The service by Angelo was perfect and efficient!
ChIJQyxJR38pQg0R2Hgf2_-FU6c,5,Super good. Great service!
ChIJtfJ45_cpQg0RHQMle5DY1Fs,3,"Before I get into why I've left a three-star review, I'd like to point out that the service was excellent. Absolutely no complaints there.

My issue has to do with the false advertising on La Desayuner√≠a's new menu.

Context: We've always been big fans of La Desayuner√≠a, particularly for their pancakes (which are or, at least until recently, were the best American-style pancakes you could get in Madrid) and their marvellous skillet potatoes, drenched in cheese and sprinkled with generous doses of onions and peppers.

In fact, the first photo, taken back in August 2021 during one of our first visits to their Chueca location, features these very potatoes. They were so delicious, the skillet potatoes alone were enough to convince my partner to pay numerous repeat visits over the following three years, with and without at least half a dozen friends who we also converted into loyal customers.

Fast forward to today, about six months since our last visit. Besides the fact that prices of most dishes had increased an average of $2 to $4 in the interim, the skillet potatoes we ordered today did not remotely resemble our favorite dish (exhibit B: the second photo I've shared). Can the real skillet potatoes please stand up?

Not only were these alleged ""skillet potatoes"" a sad, microwave-reheated attempt at home fries, they were a world away from what La Desayuner√≠a had previously advertised as skillet potatoes.

I never imagined you guys would stoop this low, but I'm afraid that today I was deeply disappointed."
ChIJtfJ45_cpQg0RHQMle5DY1Fs,3,"I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with fried chicken!! The sandwich was nice but the fried chicken could be better ... it looked as it was re-heated... dry and hard to chew.

The place is well located in the restaurant area and tables available without reservation required.

They could have a lunch deal."
ChIJtfJ45_cpQg0RHQMle5DY1Fs,5,"I like this place a lot. Visited a couple of times with family. Children friendly.
Generous portions, good prices. Friendly atmosphere.
I really like jars with cold water that are served directly when you sit at no cost!
My daughter enjoys pancakes so much! Last time we try those chocolate brownies - yummy üòã
Fries are tasty. The burger is good, especially the bread."
ChIJtfJ45_cpQg0RHQMle5DY1Fs,5,"Of the coffee places in Caliedo, this is my favorite. They have good coffee and cake. It was also not too crowded, while the playlist was awesome. I can't wait to comeback for the pancakes."
ChIJtfJ45_cpQg0RHQMle5DY1Fs,5,"I really like the food, the ambience and their service, they really take good attention  specially their encargado Elvis üòä"
ChIJoxJdgdApQg0ReEigPsqvvho,5,"I just have to share my incredible dining experience here with my friend. From start to finish, it was absolutely amazing. The atmosphere was incredibly relaxing, setting the perfect tone for a memorable meal. The food was beyond delicious you could watch the entire pizza making process, and it was clear how much care went into creating each dish. Every bite was pure perfection, melting in my mouth. The service was also top-notch, with friendly staff (As I remember the name Lunar and Jennifer) who made us feel truly welcomed. It was a wonderful experience, and I highly recommend visiting. Don‚Äôt miss out on this opportunity for a delightful and relaxing time!"
ChIJoxJdgdApQg0ReEigPsqvvho,4,"When we arrived first the guy frim the bar mentioned that the staffs were not around and advises us to come back in 30 minutes.

We walkes around and came back as we craved for Italian.

We ordered pizza and lasagna. Taste is good but not extraordinary. What we loved the most is the tiramisu (given we need to remind the staff about our ordered on this before)."
ChIJoxJdgdApQg0ReEigPsqvvho,3,"Be advised this is a gluten free restaurant. And I realize it‚Äôs quite clear they have that option, what was not clear to me was that it was the only option, furthermore when you access the QR code for menu options, you can select the regular menu. Hence it did come as a surprise when we were brought the bill and prices didn‚Äôt match the menu, because gluten free is more expensive.
Other than that, average pizza place with rather transactional service.
Tiramisu was unnecessarily bitter, due to strong coffee."
ChIJoxJdgdApQg0ReEigPsqvvho,5,I had an amazing experience at Squadra di Grosso. The place is very comfy; the ambience is exactly what I was looking for; the pizza was exquisite!!!  Ahinoa and Ernesto provided a wonderful service; they very professional and kind. I will definitely come back.!
ChIJoxJdgdApQg0ReEigPsqvvho,2,"Very good pizza, great place/atmosphere, terrible service. The place is open from 8pm but we could not start ordering our pizzas before 8:45pm. It happened before, so it seems they start working as they please. The staff also show little empathy for customers. With the right management this place would rock..."
ChIJbW6Dd2wpQg0RxmLtC8FunqE,4,I had a very good experience. Food quality was good and price was reasonable compared to the local restaurants. There must have been some initial issues a couple of months ago as I can see there were some bad reviews. I hope they keep up the service!
ChIJbW6Dd2wpQg0RxmLtC8FunqE,4,"Very good service and very friendly, affordable prices but some dishes lack quantity. In general I recommend."
ChIJbW6Dd2wpQg0RxmLtC8FunqE,1,"A disaster!! They take a while to serve you with the terrace half empty. We ordered some squid and they gave us some scarce squid, no, very few. We ordered a red summer wine that the menu says is 3.80 and they charge us ‚Ç¨6 because they say it is the large glass, which we have not ordered. The service a disaster. To not return."
ChIJbW6Dd2wpQg0RxmLtC8FunqE,1,"Terrible service.
Poor quality and expensive food.
An hour and twenty to just serve us drinks and a portion of octopus. We leave without eating and paying 40e for the portion and 4 cokes.
They don't even notify you of what has happened and blame the kitchen.
We will never return"
ChIJbW6Dd2wpQg0RxmLtC8FunqE,1,"The worst octopus I have ever eaten, spending ‚Ç¨20 wasted, I should have returned it, with day-old bread and I ask for two beers and he brings me two balls, ‚Ç¨5 each ball, bad place."
ChIJdYy2qLMpQg0RcTBfjROFuWg,5,They serve a great shawarma here packed of meat and veggies. If you want a value for money meal in Caliedo then this is your place.
ChIJdYy2qLMpQg0RcTBfjROFuWg,4,Enjoyed the cozy vibe . They serve good halal food with ample portions . Definitely a great place for a chill hangout. don't expect mind-blowing flavors though.
ChIJdYy2qLMpQg0RcTBfjROFuWg,5,"Awesome restaurant overall! The staff is incredibly friendly; very welcoming; super fast service and dog friendly (our waiter even gave our dog a bowl full of fresh water). What about the food? Priceless. One of the best lebanese restaurants we‚Äôve been in) and we have been in Lebanon, so that is one hell of a compliment! Great food! Great staff! We‚Äôll be back! 100% recommended!"
ChIJdYy2qLMpQg0RcTBfjROFuWg,5,"After a thorough search for the finest Shawarma in Madrid, I've determined that Makan is the top choice. The taste is genuine and outstanding. The combination of marinated meat with fresh fixings and hot pita bread is utterly tantalizing. The warm reception from the amiable cashier enhances the cozy vibe of the place. For enthusiasts of shawarma, it's an essential stop.

Nevertheless, it's worth noting that the restaurant often gets busy due to its location near IE University and the offices of several major firms. To enjoy their excellent shawarma without the hassle of waiting, consider getting your meal to go."
ChIJdYy2qLMpQg0RcTBfjROFuWg,5,Loved the service - the gentleman behind the counter was very kind and wonderful. My server was very attentive and the wrap was yum! A brownie was added in with compliments of the restaurant and that made it sweeter :-) Loved the texture of the roll‚Äôs wrap - it was very different from what I have had before.
ChIJiTLg3_kpQg0RUCKnDdNRs5U,5,Seems to be a chain. I saw several places all over Madrid and also at the airport. The service here was good. I went there twice. Once I had huevos rotos and secreto (a meat plate). Both was real good and not too expensive. The atmosphere is ok but not extremely unique or cosy. Second time I was eating a mixed plate with ib√©rico ham and cheese. Tasted also good.
ChIJiTLg3_kpQg0RUCKnDdNRs5U,5,"First time here, very tasty food , Served by Julian ,a really nice and friendly man ,I would recommend it to any one, brilliant local beer with our food ,3 lunches with 2 beers and 2  white wines all for  only‚Ç¨47 .
Thank you very much."
ChIJiTLg3_kpQg0RUCKnDdNRs5U,5,Qualities is always good. I drank a couple drinks with France all good nothing for food but drinks are always good and they come at your table when you‚Äôre outside in the Terrace.
ChIJiTLg3_kpQg0RUCKnDdNRs5U,5,"Thanks for a beautiful evening. We enjoyed very delicious food, good wine and an outstanding service from Mat√≠as. So friendly and attentive. Was a pleasure to meet you. üòä"
ChIJiTLg3_kpQg0RUCKnDdNRs5U,5,"Helena provided us great service tonight, she was very attentive and checked on us frequently. Food and drinks were very good! Nice outdoor patio!"
ChIJ5_G0pnwpQg0RMySH4dNKiAA,4,"Well-known as a main stay in the Cuatro Torres & IE Tower area, New York Burger is a decent place to eat - nothing mind-blowing,  pricier than Five Guys, the best I can give is 4 stars based primarily on the excellent service of its staff.

For dinner, I ordered the Chicken Parm, House Pasta, and an Empire Burger (as recommended by a friend). The Chicken Parm was fairly standard in taste and texture, a bit too cheesy for my taste. The house pasta was a bland dish that seemed to belong more to a Kids Menu than the standard menu, at least it came with a piece of grilled chicken breast.

The Empire burger was frankly, a let-down. For a restaurant called New York Burger, there was nothing New York Empire State about the burger. It was salty, slimy, and unappetizing. Normally, pulled pork pairs well with a cheeseburger - in this case, it made the burger incredibly salty and entirely unappealing.

The saving grace for this review is that the server staff were incredibly welcoming, friendly, and efficient. Not only were they very attentive to my order, but they made sure that there was no empty glass, plate, or used napkin on my table for less than a few minutes. Additionally, they were very quick to replenish tissue paper and clean the toilets!"
ChIJ5_G0pnwpQg0RMySH4dNKiAA,5,"Finished it in 3 mins. Amazing quality and the service was polite, efficient and inviting. Ambience was relaxed. Will definitely repeat."
ChIJ5_G0pnwpQg0RMySH4dNKiAA,5,"Tried out New York Burger Caleido for the first time. Place was nice, Nicol√°s my waiter was very friendly and spoke very good English (a rarity in Madrid).
The burger was very tasty. A BIG juicy burger.
Come to this place for PROPER burgers and good service."
ChIJ5_G0pnwpQg0RMySH4dNKiAA,1,The price of the nachos were scamming because 2 of us ordered a plate of nachos and they charged us the price of 4-8 people. the burger meat was also left a very unpleasant taste.
ChIJ5_G0pnwpQg0RMySH4dNKiAA,5,Nicolas was really helpful and as always the food was great! We love coming here. My Spanish is decent but if I ever struggle I‚Äôve always been able to switch to English without any problems.
ChIJgxEzDZ4pQg0RR_UQRIjgpkk,2,"We had the menu of the day and were very disappointed with the quality of the food. While it had flavour, it was clear that the dishes weren‚Äôt freshly prepared but reheated.
I chose the cod which was swimming in oil making it soggy instead of crispy.

The service was very friendly although you can note a lack of training.

It seems that the management are indifferent to the negative feedback given that they never respond to any reviews. It‚Äôs a shame because the restaurant has a lot of potential."
ChIJgxEzDZ4pQg0RR_UQRIjgpkk,5,What a wonderful place and staff! Cristo is very competent and professional as a waiter. And the food is breathtaking!
ChIJgxEzDZ4pQg0RR_UQRIjgpkk,4,"My chai latte was cold and was more like milk with some tea flavour.
Service was ok, but they did not take our order correctly (maybe because of the noise level or busy period).
Tables were not that clean."
ChIJgxEzDZ4pQg0RR_UQRIjgpkk,5,"We are visiting from Colorado, United States and it was absolutely amazing! Super tasty, and great service from Rodrigo!"
ChIJgxEzDZ4pQg0RR_UQRIjgpkk,3,"This beautiful looking restaurant seems to have more focus on how the plates look than how they taste. The pepper salad hadn‚Äôt been peeled and the potatoes where in seasoned, and the meet was sinewy. The croquetas were nice. Customer service was excellent."
ChIJHSow21ApQg0RcfDEkYGgUbA,5,"This is the best place to eat in Caleido. Many creative delicious options to choose from. Best in my opinion are the sweet potato fries with cream cheese and the Sweet Honey Goat Bowl. I always recommend this place. Good quantity and great quality healthy food. The place decoration is also elegant and mute, letting the food shine with its vibrant colors. The ambience is also lively with people most of the time."
ChIJHSow21ApQg0RcfDEkYGgUbA,5,"Amazimg all natural food restaurant.
Large open kitchen. I wanted to photograph everything within the kitchen, countless, beautifulchopped vegetables, fruits, lettuces, salmon, beef, chicken, bread, miscellabeous sauces, with perhaps
6-8 preparers all operating like the interior parts of a clock.
Then, the presentation of the dishes--each one as if a piece of art (which I did photograph to send to friends!
Lastly, the food tasted excellent.  Highly, highly recommended."
ChIJHSow21ApQg0RcfDEkYGgUbA,5,"This place is excellent! The quality of food is superb, food presentation is also Gourmet type, the atmosphere is inviting and cozy, the service is impeccable, and the staff is super nica and friendly. Last no least, prices are affordable and reasonable compared to the quality of service and food served in this place. Highly recommended üòç"
ChIJHSow21ApQg0RcfDEkYGgUbA,5,"Honest Greens is perfect for a quick, healthy meal without compromising on taste. Whether you‚Äôre a local or just visiting Madrid, this place is a great option for fresh and satisfying food. Highly recommended!"

ChIJFQvR5wopQg0R7xgnIB7_ouw,5,Great lunch menu with many option to choose from. Both ceviche and teppanyaki steak was great!
ChIJFQvR5wopQg0R7xgnIB7_ouw,5,"Excellent,great & delicious food, wonderful atmosphere & service was really great too.Price is also afortable.So,I recommend everyone to try dishes in this restaurant."
ChIJFQvR5wopQg0R7xgnIB7_ouw,5,"I love this restaurant, I‚Äôve been there three times and I just can‚Äôt get enough. My favorite  sushi is the Philadelphia roll and the favorite main dish is the chicken Kong Pao. In my opinion this place is a must."
ChIJFQvR5wopQg0R7xgnIB7_ouw,5,"Had a beautiful stay in the terrace. Ate misho soup (terrific!), nigiris, fried rice with  chicken and noodles with veggies. Also some mochis as a dessert, great experience!"
ChIJFQvR5wopQg0R7xgnIB7_ouw,5,"I liked the environment, the food was delicious, different taste, good service and better price!"
ChIJA3xP7BMpQg0RHywta-3liSk,4,Great setting and nice service. We had dinner and there is a quite a lot of glare off the windows. Views probably best appreciated during the day. We ordered the lobster spaghetti which was under seasoned. The tuna tartare was pretty good. And we shared a leg of lamb which was nice but again lacked flavour that I expected for this price level. Whilst a nice experience there was no wow factor.
ChIJA3xP7BMpQg0RHywta-3liSk,5,"Excellent overall experience. Jos√© Luis, the host, made us feel at home.
Food was outstanding, especially the anchovies with tomatoes butter, tuna tartare with avocado and the entrecot (Rubia Gallega).

All this enjoying best views from Madrid skyline"
ChIJA3xP7BMpQg0RHywta-3liSk,4,Great atmosphere and good food at high altitude. Here you can enjoy a tasty menu of quality ingredients. The view is amazing and service is very good.
ChIJA3xP7BMpQg0RHywta-3liSk,5,"We visited Elkar for a dinner. The restaurant is on the 33rd floor of the Torre Emperador in Castellana. They offer gourmet food with very friendly service, there is somebody looking after you during your dinner. The price is higher but the location and views on the city are unique. After the dinner, we received a round-walk to have 360 degrees panorama on the city. Worth to try!

Video recommendation: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6hRnU-L9ZC/?igsh=MWZpZ3MyeDZ4OTY0ag=="
ChIJA3xP7BMpQg0RHywta-3liSk,3,"Located in the business center. Don't forget your passport, security will ask for it.

Interior. The lighting is awful! It looks like the unpleasant lighting that is turned on when a movie ends at the cinema. Uncomfortable. Cheap lamps on the tables finally kill the atmosphere.

Service. There were few guests in the restaurant, but even so we waited an hour just to make an order. The waiters very often didn‚Äôt notice our empty glasses. By the end of the evening, we took the initiative (and bottles of wine) into our own hands to serve each other.

Dishes. The main dish (pigeon) is interesting and delicious. Dessert is also great.

So, the chef is the only hope of this restaurant, because the interior and service are terrible."
ChIJJeS0D9MpQg0RkmltO1u5Uc4,5,"I visit it every day when working in Madrid in one one the towers of the financial district, the coffee is nothing special (it‚Äôs Starbucks after all) but every time I go I am surprised to find the same people on the counter, a couple of guys (one with beautiful tattoos) and a blonde girl. They are very friendly to customers, by the end of the week they remember my order and name and I tend to stop for a chit chat. I like to see the interactions between them, it‚Äôs a job and it gets very busy at times, but you can tell they get on well aning themselves and do the best they can for their customers.  I choose to go there for the friendly atmosphere, it helps me disconnect from the computer screen, hope management looks after this crew, they are wonderful people."
ChIJJeS0D9MpQg0RkmltO1u5Uc4,5,"First impression is that the staff are very friendly and they were very helpful with my order. The coffee taste better than Starbucks in America üá∫üá∏.
Maybe is a different coffee or they make it different but I love it. üòª"
ChIJJeS0D9MpQg0RkmltO1u5Uc4,5,"Starbucks Caleido has become my regular spot since starting to work in one of the towers. I love that every time I go they remember my name and order, especially Rocio who is always so friendly and welcoming. The quality of the products is also very consistent and good. I highly recommend this location. Also, the terrace on warm days is great!"
ChIJJeS0D9MpQg0RkmltO1u5Uc4,1,"Although the staff is nice, the coffees that they make are terrible. It is not their fault, management should train them properly. Every drink that comes out, no matter what you order (besides an Americano), is basically a latte with way too much of the poorly foamed and burned milk. Even after a month of giving this place a try, returning drinks, asking for double espressos - the coffees have not improved."
ChIJJeS0D9MpQg0RkmltO1u5Uc4,5,"Nice place to visit, the staff it's kindly and the coffee tastes SO good, üíØ"
ChIJnxBjgjApQg0R_kS16f5Y5Ew,5,"Very clear, fast, affordable and delicious. Also opened during national holidays."
ChIJnxBjgjApQg0R_kS16f5Y5Ew,5,"It‚Äôs mcdonalds what do you expect, but for the amount of people the service is pretty fast"
ChIJnxBjgjApQg0R_kS16f5Y5Ew,1,"Very bad work environment, everything was full and the lady who picks up things from the table is a skinny little girl with short hair, medium gray hair, what she needed was to hit me! And twice he loudly pushed me away from the trash that I was going to throw away, but I stood there for a moment with him. coffee to place the sugar since there were no more tables, I did it accidentally and she
""twice she did the same thing"" poorly educated, badly spoken, and obviously a bad person because twice it is not unintentionally"
ChIJnxBjgjApQg0R_kS16f5Y5Ew,1,"Three days without receiving the payment. I did not rate the service with any stars, since they cannot be rated negatively. 48 hours and I am still waiting for the refund of the ‚Ç¨15.82 payment made and the service not provided. Come on. That we are still waiting for the food. Real mistreatment of customers. INCREDIBLE"
ChIJnxBjgjApQg0R_kS16f5Y5Ew,5,"McDonald's located next to the Bego√±a metro and the La Paz hospital. The place is very clean, as are its bathrooms. The food was brought out in approximately 5 minutes."
ChIJDQF3wtMpQg0RuIFxqg62wjc,4,"We have had food a couple of times, and for the price it is not a bad option. Of the dishes we have tried, I choose without a doubt the teriyaki chicken rice (with mushrooms, spring garlic, sesame and chives), being the only one I would repeat. The arroz a banda (with seafood and squid stock) did not convince us, and neither did the chicken curry with rice (and this is a preparation that we usually like a lot, but the meat was a little dry, although perhaps that is not usual). The chicken tenderloins with Roquefort cheese with potatoes are also good, the potatoes lose a little when heated, but the sauce saves them a lot, and the chicken was much better than in the curry option. It is a place that we would repeat if we were in the area and were in a hurry."
ChIJDQF3wtMpQg0RuIFxqg62wjc,5,Unbeatable price quality! I tried it to take away and today I ate it at the store! I hope they open one in the area where I live tooüòÇ
ChIJDQF3wtMpQg0RuIFxqg62wjc,5,"I thought it was great, super cheap food at ‚Ç¨9.95, I had a starter, a main, a drink and a dessert, there is also half a menu inside the warm shopping center in front of the cinemas"
ChIJDQF3wtMpQg0RuIFxqg62wjc,4,"Un sitio simp√°tico de reciente apertura.

Pros:
* Precio super econ√≥mico.
* Atenci√≥n excelente, de 10. Personal realmente muy agradable.
* Muchas opciones para elegir.
* Decoraci√≥n bonita.
* Todo lo que probamos estaba bastante bueno. Volveremos para probar las paellas, que ten√≠an muy buena pinta.

Contras:
* Raciones algo escasas. No digo que todos comamos como jugadores de rugby, pero para un hombre promedio, pues... no sales con hambre, pero lejos de quedar saciado.
* Algunos platos parece que soportan peor que otros el envasado, calentado en microondas etc. P. Ej. Pasta, tallarines etc quedan algo (algo...) pasadillos. Se comen sin problemas, y entiendo que es dif√≠cil mantener el punto, pero bueno, seguro que se podr√≠a mejorar.

En general, sitio muy recomendable, tanto para tomar alli como para llevar."
ChIJDQF3wtMpQg0RuIFxqg62wjc,5,"Super friendly staff.
Very good food.
Nachter was around and I met him in person. Recommended 100%"
ChIJcb649HIpQg0RbtZUen3kD4w,1,"Horrible place, very overpriced for a coffee and tomato bread because they only had available fancy options. Oil was not enough for the toast and they charged extra for another mini pot. Woman was rude, queues were long and it did not offer anything special for the extra cost. We will not go there again and by the absence of ""white coats"" in the queue this seems the consensus among hospital staff too."
ChIJcb649HIpQg0RbtZUen3kD4w,4,"I really liked this cafeteria, they have practically everything, clean, organized and pretty, the prices maybe a little high, otherwise everything is fine."
ChIJY5MQUK8pQg0RGzNPhoSs0-E,5,"An amazong experience! Music, excellent food, a service that will blow your mind, this is a must to do at least once in a lifetime! Worth every penny !! Congrats to the team for the excellent job they do day after day"
ChIJY5MQUK8pQg0RGzNPhoSs0-E,5,"Went here for my birthday. It was honestly amazing. It was a really fun journey of food. through all the senses. Each colour had its own theme. we had the wine pairing, and it was very good as well. The experience was extremely personalised. I highly recommend it."
ChIJY5MQUK8pQg0RGzNPhoSs0-E,5,Visited on my first day in Madrid without sleeping for 30 hours and with a complete inability to speak or understand Spanish.  I was worried I would be bored and tired but the experience was amazing.  The show was wonderful.  Google translate helped a little as did the incredible other diners and staff.  The food and drinks were exquisite.  I don't think this experience could be replicated anywhere else.  It was an incredible beginning to a terrific slightly extended weekend getaway.
ChIJY5MQUK8pQg0RGzNPhoSs0-E,5,"Spectacular! I highly recommend this immersive experience if you are in Madrid.

Color, sound, and amazing flavors are combined into a unique experience, a true gift to the senses.

Dinner is a spectacle where you laugh, travel, and sing... while enjoying delicious food.

The team is fantastic, professional, and fun. They play a big part in making this a success.

Definitely a place I‚Äôll visit again."
ChIJY5MQUK8pQg0RGzNPhoSs0-E,3,"It‚Äôs a cool experience, great for my girlfriend filling up her social media‚Ä¶ But the food was dismal at best, the price is nowhere near justified for what you get in return. The alcohol pairing was much better than the food.
The service was amazing, staff was extremely friendly and attentive.
The experience is something you‚Äôll remember, the price should be cut in half‚Ä¶ You will leave hungry and I‚Äôm not someone with a big appetite."
ChIJ1WtSMvspQg0RSJ2pCSYIWYQ,2,"Im giving it 2 stars because the food was good, the service and staff was really nice, but it was very expensive and little amount of food. I was expecting more quantity and for that price better quality. Comparing it to Honest greens and other healthy places around, Caleido, I‚Äôd say it is not worth it."
ChIJ1WtSMvspQg0RSJ2pCSYIWYQ,4,The food is great but expensive for what it is. Nevertheless all staff was adorable and the place is nice. Lacking of sitting area.
ChIJ1WtSMvspQg0RSJ2pCSYIWYQ,5,they have so many options and the service is amazing. I highly recommend the green detox or the fajita bowl ü•µ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• 10/10
ChIJ1WtSMvspQg0RSJ2pCSYIWYQ,5,"Great place for food to go. Quick, tasty and good price in comparison to other similar places. I ordered by Glovo so I can‚Äôt value the service and people."
ChIJ1WtSMvspQg0RSJ2pCSYIWYQ,5,"I loved the salad, they have unique vinaigrettes and the combinations are very original. The banana bread they have is delicious. It is 100% recommended, I would definitely repeat it a thousand times üíöüíöüíöüíö"
ChIJ1SWyP40pQg0RYIrs4nN9lzg,3,Food was nice but missed flavour. A little pricy and less qualitative when compared to honest greens. Still great food.
ChIJ1SWyP40pQg0RYIrs4nN9lzg,4,An enjoyable experience that came after the trouble of searching for healthy and delicious food. I walked a distance of 23 minutes. The food is good and the flavor does not overwhelm its nature. The quantity is appropriate. Grilled salmon / guacamole 8/10. The menu needs more coordination to improve the selection.
ChIJ1SWyP40pQg0RYIrs4nN9lzg,4,"Restaurant for ‚Äúhealthy food‚Äù. You have to order inside, bring your own drinks to the table‚Ä¶ the outdoor terrace is great."
ChIJ1SWyP40pQg0RYIrs4nN9lzg,1,Worst coffee i ever had in my life. Ordered 4 and was served stoned cold. The bar tender said thats how the machine does it.
ChIJ1SWyP40pQg0RYIrs4nN9lzg,5,Amazing food and drinks!
ChIJGw9jXKIpQg0RAqhpx53Y2AA,1,"Knee of La Paz, they are thieves. 4.50 euros for the cheapest sandwich from there up. Thieves, you take advantage of the people who have to stay in the hospital.  As soon as I saw the prices I turned around.
McDonald's was full and with such a big place, four people, you are mean.
I was a customer of yours at other stores, from now on you have lost a good customer
See you never"
ChIJGw9jXKIpQg0RAqhpx53Y2AA,1,"I went to eat a hot sandwich, they told me it had to be takeaway and they gave me a cold one because there were 10 minutes left before closing. They say the machine takes a while to cool down and they turn it off sooner. If they have a closing time it will be for a reason. I'll stop by tomorrow to ask for a claim form."
ChIJGw9jXKIpQg0RAqhpx53Y2AA,1,"It really seems a shame to me that the prices they have on this Knee. As a general rule, people who eat in places close to a hospital do so because it is the fastest and most accessible for somewhat difficult situations (as has been my case) and the prices they have in this establishment are an abuse. I'm not saying that they make it cheaper, in fact, they don't usually cost half a sandwich for 1.80 no matter how delicious they are. But at least at the same price as any Knee. Don't bother telling me that they are of extraordinary quality.... because that doesn't justify the price 4'50 two halves of a sandwich...in their little box."
ChIJGw9jXKIpQg0RAqhpx53Y2AA,1,"I find it a real SHAME that they take advantage of patients by setting AIRPORT prices. Instead of maintaining the same prices as in the other Rodillas in the city, they inflate prices taking advantage of this location.
Regrettable"
ChIJGw9jXKIpQg0RAqhpx53Y2AA,1,"SHAME, An armed robbery for clueless people, if in a knee establishment the sandwich costs ‚Ç¨1.70, in the hospital knee it comes in a pack of 2 sandwiches and they charge you ‚Ç¨4.70 that is 1, ‚Ç¨30 more, there is no option for an individual sandwich, a SHAME"
ChIJ8zyard4pQg0RThqBKwsT91U,4,"Food truck in the Caleido shopping center. It is in the middle between the Caleido Machine and the Secrets restaurant. One of the best coffees in the area. You can get a loyalty card to get free coffees. You have sweet and savory options. It has a small terrace where it is luxurious on days like today. The worst thing is the waiting times, even though the guys work well and fast."
ChIJ8zyard4pQg0RThqBKwsT91U,5,"R‚ÄôSPIRO is a wonderful place to have a coffee with friends or your pet.üê∂

It is located in the Caleido shopping center next to the four towers.

Their quality-price coffee is very good, plus if you pay 30 cents more you can try their specialty coffee. They also serve one of the best bikinis in Madrid.

It is a very good place for people looking for quality, although for gourmets it is still a step below other specialty coffee shops.‚ú®"
ChIJ8zyard4pQg0RThqBKwsT91U,5,"The best place to take a break. They have a wide variety of coffee and food menus at good prices. The service is fast, they prepare your order to take away if you are in a hurry, and the terrace is great to disconnect from the office."
ChIJ8zyard4pQg0RThqBKwsT91U,2,"The coffee was not bad although it was nothing special, but the person who served us failed to spit on us in the coffee, nor did he look at us when we placed the order, all with an incredibly disgusted face, with that attitude it doesn't make you want to come back. That was totally empty."
ChIJ8zyard4pQg0RThqBKwsT91U,5,"I discovered it the other day because it is under my office and I was very surprised by the coffee they serve. I also ordered the chocolate roll and it was incredible. 100% recommended, I will repeat"
ChIJhcOtmxQpQg0R0d1ztX_YWdY,3,"Petit App√©tit may sound French, but it‚Äôs a very typical Spanish experience.
The place itself is nice‚Äîmodern, clean, and newly opened, which is a plus. They offer a daily menu for around 17 euros, which isn‚Äôt exactly cheap. Unfortunately, this is where the positives end.

The starters were underwhelming: a basic salad, salmorejo soup, or chicken croquetas. I chose the croquetas, which were poorly presented, served on a few pieces of supermarket salad with no effort at all. For the main, I went with the burger, and it was one of the lamest I‚Äôve had‚Äîsmall, with a meat patty that didn‚Äôt even cover the bun, and only some caramelized onions to set it apart. It came with a handful of fries and no presentation whatsoever. My friend‚Äôs grilled vegetables looked like a side dish rather than a main.

Dessert options were disappointing too: pudding or pineapple, so I went with the pineapple, only to get three thin slices. Music was too loud, and overall, the food was bland and not memorable. I will not be returning. Not recommended."
ChIJhcOtmxQpQg0R0d1ztX_YWdY,5,"We visited during our holiday in Madrid because it is very close to the hotel where we stayed at the Four Towers. We had the best pulpo we ate in Madrid as a starter, the mashed potato was super tasteful too. We had also the vaca frita and the fettuccine, torrija and wine. The price was good for everything. The atmosphere was very nice and good music for the season. Service was very good and Wilber/Will was super helpful, always with a smile and trying to make us feel very comfortable. We would come back for the food, the prices and the service."
ChIJhcOtmxQpQg0R0d1ztX_YWdY,5,Perfect for a large group quick work lunch- the team were very accommodating and speedy with service from the Menu del D√≠a
ChIJhcOtmxQpQg0R0d1ztX_YWdY,5,"We live close by so have been here for dinner several times and enjoyed it immensely each time. Wonderful staff, friendly service, and great food. Tuna tataki, duck, truffle risotto, and pizza aguacate are all standouts. Highly recommend this little hidden gem in Cuatro Torres / Caleido ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©"
ChIJhcOtmxQpQg0R0d1ztX_YWdY,5,Brutal!!!
ChIJTwlrUrYpQg0RojO_8TcWH9I,5,"On Thursday we went to eat the menu of the day and the service was very good. The restaurant waiter was very nice to my daughter and me, the food was good value for money and very quick to serve. I have to admit that looking at the reviews I didn't know what we were going to find but I loved what we saw. I understand that the problem comes mainly from the huge groups of people who can arrive suddenly since it is located in the Torres de Madrid and there are many employees there, so with at most 3 people serving it, it is logical that the service would slow down if the restaurant suddenly fills up, in which case the problem would be the lack of enough staff in the restaurant. Thank you very much for this pleasant oasis in the middle of the infernal heat of Madrid, until next time."
ChIJTwlrUrYpQg0RojO_8TcWH9I,5,"We ate today, April 28, and everything was PHENOMENAL. From the attention of the waiters to the food, everything was very good. I would return and repeat without hesitation üëèüëè a pleasure to meet you Edison!!! Keep it up üí™ I'll see you soon for sure."
ChIJTwlrUrYpQg0RojO_8TcWH9I,5,The food was excellent and the service was also very good. It is worth it and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe four towers is very interesting...
ChIJTwlrUrYpQg0RojO_8TcWH9I,5,"Excellent service, always waiting in case you need anything, in addition to the food which was very delicious, I ordered sticky rice, feira octopus and fried eggs with shrimp, eels and octopus, all excellent and an unmatched flavor. ‚Äú100% recommended‚Äù"
ChIJTwlrUrYpQg0RojO_8TcWH9I,4,Very correct service. Restaurant area and a small area for portions and snacks. The octopus salad is very delicious to accompany a glass of albari√±o üòâ. Menu of the day of good quality and very affordable price.

ChIJQajUnPMpQg0RgZON_LwJ9lI,4,"Vaca Nostra delivered an exceptional steakhouse experience. The service was attentive, and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. Although the restaurant was surprisingly quiet for a Friday night, we appreciated the relaxed and intimate atmosphere.

We shared a perfectly cooked steak and a delicious appetizer, both beautifully complemented by a local Madrid wine recommended by the staff. Every element of the meal was thoughtful and well-executed.

Highly recommend for anyone looking to enjoy quality food, great service, and a calm dining experience in Madrid."
ChIJQajUnPMpQg0RgZON_LwJ9lI,5,"We were disappointed during the last visit. The first few times were amazing, my wife and I wanted to give this steakhouse another chance, this time around there were outstanding
The steak was cooked to perfection, the rest of the menu we tried was unbelievable
As always the staff was extremely friendly knowledgeable and friendly.
The atmosphere and low music, allowed a nice conversation
I would definitely return"
ChIJQajUnPMpQg0RgZON_LwJ9lI,5,"Stopped here for a lunch with colleagues. We ordered two big steaks (around 3kg) of Angus and rubia gallega. The meat was cooked perfectly and was really good. They were accompanied by chips and peppers. Is not a cheap restaurant but is worth every penny. Service was perfect, they showed us the weight and cost of steaks before preparing and was really quick. Highly recommended."
ChIJQajUnPMpQg0RgZON_LwJ9lI,5,Excellent steak and starters. We had the multi course menu which wasn‚Äôt initially offered when we sat down but had to point out the existence on their website.
ChIJQajUnPMpQg0RgZON_LwJ9lI,5,Great steaks and homemade beef jamon. Excellent service while the place is really impressive.
ChIJI8HRPZcpQg0R0xqKtjJkovU,5,Probably the best coffee I have had in Spain in two months.A but if a hidden gem really .Outside seats overlooking a small park.Food is  well presented and made with care.food was fresh and tasty.
ChIJI8HRPZcpQg0R0xqKtjJkovU,5,"Love this place, it‚Äôs near my house so I always stop by here to have a little snack or breakfast. Staff is so lovey and all their food is super good. The salmon bagel and brownies are the best."
ChIJI8HRPZcpQg0R0xqKtjJkovU,5,"It‚Äôs not Spanish tourist food, but holy moly it‚Äôs an absolute essential to your travel restaurant list. About a 10 walk from the Chamart√≠n station, it‚Äôs tucked away and filled with all the yummiest food and drinks."
ChIJI8HRPZcpQg0R0xqKtjJkovU,5,Maybe the best version of eggs Benedict I ever had. Place is definitely woth a visit if you are around. Coffee is amazing as well
ChIJI8HRPZcpQg0R0xqKtjJkovU,5,"Nice, small caf√© with very good breakfast options. The food was delicious and arrived quickly at my table. Since the place is very small, it feels a bit too warm and cramped when full."
ChIJk9dnNmEpQg0R2ReDQ8Ffu3g,5,Cute small spot but absolutely amazing food. Every dish we had was sooooo good and when the desert came we both had a foodgasm. The tiramisu is the best I‚Äôve ever had and I can‚Äôt stop eating it.
ChIJk9dnNmEpQg0R2ReDQ8Ffu3g,5,"As always fresh and tasty homemade food. Really good carrot cake too. One of the best brunch places in the area. They even make their own bio kimchi. Also there are possibility to rent the whole place and be able to have a private lunch or dinner.
Totally recommended."
ChIJk9dnNmEpQg0R2ReDQ8Ffu3g,5,"Lovely cafe tucked away in a quiet street. Fresh OJ, cappuccino, and delicious home made breakfast toast."
ChIJk9dnNmEpQg0R2ReDQ8Ffu3g,5,"Great experience form start to finish. Ambiance, food, coffee and hospitality - 5 stars."
ChIJk9dnNmEpQg0R2ReDQ8Ffu3g,5,"Everything is spectacular. One of the best espressos and filter coffees I‚Äôve had in Madrid. The cakes/cookies are incredibly balanced and delicious. To top it off, they have a quality selection of natural wines. Paprika is a real gem, worth the journey up north out of the city to try."
ChIJJRZJtlwpQg0ROfFfJ5Rf6wg,4,"A good and quiet place to eat asian food just 5-10 min away from the train station. We had veg ramen and rolls, the ramen was good and looked nice, the rolls were ok. A bit too much for the drinks (3‚Ç¨)"
ChIJJRZJtlwpQg0ROfFfJ5Rf6wg,5,"food was really good, great quality. staff was very kind and helpful,  they gave us free mochis for dessert at the end"
ChIJJRZJtlwpQg0ROfFfJ5Rf6wg,5,One of the most underrated sushi I taste. It was so good and the price is very affordable.
ChIJJRZJtlwpQg0ROfFfJ5Rf6wg,5,"One of the best sushi shops I have tried. Great service, sumptuous menu and relaxing place. What a nice experience. üç£ü•¢üç±üçú"
ChIJJRZJtlwpQg0ROfFfJ5Rf6wg,5,"Great food, best sushi I‚Äôve ever tasted."
ChIJ6--Oo08pQg0RlTt4bZ3CU8s,1,"To any professionals or travelers coming to Madrid: avoid this hotel. No security in the rooms, no respect for guests‚Äô belongings, no honesty from the staff, and a complete failure to handle a serious incident. It is unacceptable for a hotel of this supposed standing to let a guest leave with no answers after a clear breach of trust. I strongly advise against staying here.

‚Äî-
Absolutely unacceptable experience at Hotel Mirador Chamart√≠n. I stayed there for a few nights while attending a professional trade show. After my first day out, I returned to my room to find that some of my personal belongings had mysteriously disappeared: a plastic bag containing premium underwear, and a cardboard cover that protected a pair of premium loafers. The items were simply gone from my room.

When I reported it to the front desk, I was initially told that my things had been found and placed in another room ‚Äî which was already bizarre and unprofessional. But when I came back later that evening‚Ä¶ nothing. I asked again, and suddenly the story changed: ‚ÄúWe never saw your bag.‚Äù I spoke with the housekeeper myself, who denied touching anything ‚Äî which is impossible, because no one else could have entered the room.

Bottom line: I was lied to, no one took responsibility, and there was zero transparency. Worst of all, no effort was made to address or compensate for the disappearance. The hotel has ignored my emails and refuses to offer any kind of resolution. Absolutely disgraceful."
ChIJ6--Oo08pQg0RlTt4bZ3CU8s,2,"Very Basic Hotel - Did the job, but wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying here if your trying to enjoy city centre it‚Äôs too far."
ChIJ6--Oo08pQg0RlTt4bZ3CU8s,4,Good friendly and nice place. Only issue with the nice rooms is the bathroom very cold due to bad isolation and no heater installed not to forget the simple glass aluminum windows that doesn‚Äôt hold cold nor noise.
ChIJ6--Oo08pQg0RlTt4bZ3CU8s,3,"Positives: it is an unusually decorated hotel so it doesn't feel like the standard business hotels. The beds are comfortable and the showers are step in rather than above a bath. It is in a quiet neighborhood.

Negatives: the rooms are very small and not as in the pictures (or at least ours was tiny). The bathroom is an area inside the room with a fake wall meaning you can hear everything. It is located next to a highway with very little around it. And from the centre it takes a long time to travel there via metro.

The breakfast is ridiculously expensive so we didn't try it."
ChIJ6--Oo08pQg0RlTt4bZ3CU8s,5,"Loved the hotel. Different than your typical ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù hotel with an aesthetic that will take your mind away.
The staff is friendly and welcoming."
ChIJCdR25UgpQg0Rw8R7cpaSldE,5,"The restaurant was recommended by a local, when I got there it was crowded but I still got a table pretty fast. The food was great quality for such a low price. The customer service was good and fast."
ChIJCdR25UgpQg0Rw8R7cpaSldE,5,Curbside terrasse with local beer and pinchos.
ChIJCdR25UgpQg0Rw8R7cpaSldE,5,"Good menu of the day, delicious food and good service, fast and efficient. Nice and cozy place."
ChIJCdR25UgpQg0Rw8R7cpaSldE,5,"Very delicious, especially the tortilla and the paella, I still have to try the ear, which everyone says is exquisite! And always great treatment!"
ChIJCdR25UgpQg0Rw8R7cpaSldE,4,"The El Nav√≠o restaurant is excellent, especially for fish lovers.
The freshness and flavor of the fish is remarkable; It shows that they use quality ingredients. In addition, the atmosphere is cozy and the service is very attentive.
Without a doubt, a place to which I will return to enjoy good seafood dishes."
ChIJJ2bAcE8pQg0RwtxxuDtzjtU,5,"This is a lovely, intimate Italian gem.

The burrata appetizer is excellent and the pizza is exceptional; the people are very friendly; and the beer/wine is both good and inexpensive.

I am new to Madrid but I have already been twice and tonight might just be the third foray over there.

La Ventana Verde also delivers‚Ä¶ sadly not in the area of my postal code.

Give it a try‚Ä¶ you will not be disappointed."
ChIJJ2bAcE8pQg0RwtxxuDtzjtU,5,"Tourist in Madrid (alone girl), doing a little city trip. This place was really nice. Person there are really friendly and the atmosphere was great. I was feeling like home for an evening. I eat a pizza and a tiramisu, it was excellent. No doubt you can go there to eat for sure. üòâ"
ChIJJ2bAcE8pQg0RwtxxuDtzjtU,5,"Definitely the best pizza in Madrid and the owners are incredibly nice and welcoming, I recommend it 100%!!!"
ChIJJ2bAcE8pQg0RwtxxuDtzjtU,5,Amazing pizza and local tribesman's climate
ChIJJ2bAcE8pQg0RwtxxuDtzjtU,5,"Excellent service, really good local food, nice atmosphereüëç"
ChIJU5xT7FwpQg0RYOKcJVNVB0s,1,"We were at a mother's Day party today, we didn't like it at all, I'm sorry for the time and money spent, the area is quite far from us, we took a taxi on purpose, the place itself doesn't look very good, everything is old, unkempt, I accidentally saw an advertisement on Instagram for this holiday, we decided to go and regretted it, never set foot there again, The food in the vans is of poor quality, one fast food, we don't eat that, but it was included in the general admission ticket, the beer was even of poor quality and stale, and I don't recommend going with the cheapest sausage you can probably find. , and the holiday was boring, nothing interesting. The price for three people for admission is 53 euros , I do not recommend it, in general, one disappointment"
ChIJU5xT7FwpQg0RYOKcJVNVB0s,4,"Nice place, fast service, and good organization. Your car seats are better than any cinema's."
ChIJU5xT7FwpQg0RYOKcJVNVB0s,3,"The movie is more enjoyable in a regular theater, but it's not bad at all, it's a different experience.

About the food, we ordered at the beginning of the movie and didn't arrive. We had to go to the restaurant at the end to ask for our money back."
ChIJU5xT7FwpQg0RYOKcJVNVB0s,4,"Good place to watch movie, good sound quality and screen big enough to see well the movie, only bad thing would be the low definition in dark scenes. 3 Food trucks available to buy from drinks to hot dogs. Car has to be with light turned off. Toilets are at the back of the parking place."
ChIJU5xT7FwpQg0RYOKcJVNVB0s,4,It was an alright experience. Only had one diner open when I went today though. The movie was only in Spanish and you listen via your car radio. Tickets were ‚Ç¨8 per pax. Food was alright but not cheap at ‚Ç¨6.50 for just a burger or 11 for a whole set meal.
ChIJdVlACE8pQg0RRpIibVnrmJA,5,"nice place, atmosphere and staff üëçüèª
highly recommend it for it‚Äôs delicious plates.
the neighborhood is also amazing, specifically the night."
ChIJdVlACE8pQg0RRpIibVnrmJA,5,Best paella ever - highly recommend this place and they open during the siesta time too üëçüèªüá™üá∏üíØ
ChIJdVlACE8pQg0RRpIibVnrmJA,5,"Very good food for the price.
Plentiful portions
Waiter was really nice and helpful

Even though the food came 15 mins late, they gave us free bread to compensate for it."
ChIJdVlACE8pQg0RRpIibVnrmJA,5,This place Reminds me home ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChIJdVlACE8pQg0RRpIibVnrmJA,3,"Excellent rice. Place to go for proper paella cooked rice dishes. Had the rabbit and vegetables, very good. Have usually ordered the plain vegetable paella. Remember the paella is the pan not the food. Correct term is arroz a la paella."
ChIJ3eEnNEkpQg0RV9o0Sisd7-8,4,"Great place with excellent food. The ensaladilla was a surprise, but probably my favorite thing were the boquerones al lim√≥n! Desserts are not worth it, but the food was great."
ChIJ3eEnNEkpQg0RV9o0Sisd7-8,5,"The owner Joaquin went out of his way to please me.
Restaurant was full and he didnt stop until we were seated.
Great food. We had Bonito fish plate. Ambience was perfect. Elegant and polite customers. A very pleasant night! Will surely return."
ChIJ3eEnNEkpQg0RV9o0Sisd7-8,5,"Two couples ate last Saturday the 26th. It had been recommended to us and it was a great success.
The owner and his team are very friendly and professional. We ordered their family Betanzos omelette and Russian salad, very delicious, and jig squid with egg, like in C√°diz, very fresh and tasty, and some spectacular Bilbao-style bocartes.
The wonderful desserts.
We will repeat for sure!"
ChIJ3eEnNEkpQg0RV9o0Sisd7-8,3,"We tried several delicious things and some normal ones, price a bit high for the service they have."
ChIJ3eEnNEkpQg0RV9o0Sisd7-8,5,"Just three things about this site
Quality, (we could see some dishes with a perfect preparation in dishes such as the very good Bilbao turbot, the skewer hake that is prepared grilled or rebosada. Many dishes that I could suggest without any doubt, in few places the good genre comes together with a perfect preparation and plating.
Service, despite always being full, the waiters are always attentive and very close to the customer since many of us who frequent the place already know them.
And finally the cleanliness of the premises in few places maintain cleanliness like Altair, the bathroom is beautiful and clean like few others for me a place of 10 üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
ChIJaxOBA08pQg0RtuvX1ndv3Lc,4,"Good Whopper, good service quality, made an effort to look for a member of staff who speaks English, and free Wi-Fi id available. There's a playground for kids too."
ChIJaxOBA08pQg0RtuvX1ndv3Lc,4,"Excellent, good tasty hamburger,  hot fries, helpful and pleasant staff. Will go again."
ChIJaxOBA08pQg0RtuvX1ndv3Lc,5,Ok
ChIJaxOBA08pQg0RtuvX1ndv3Lc,5,the playing area there is very good
ChIJaxOBA08pQg0RtuvX1ndv3Lc,5,This is the best BK in Madrid. Every time
ChIJM_ligUYpQg0RAhHxqhcbl4Y,4,"Very friendly. I haven't eaten there, but I have had a wine. Good place, nice terrace"
ChIJM_ligUYpQg0RAhHxqhcbl4Y,5,Very good experience! Sergio has treated me wonderfully! I'll go back for the rice!!!
ChIJM_ligUYpQg0RAhHxqhcbl4Y,1,"I came for breakfast and it cost me ‚Ç¨7 for 2 coffees and 2 toasts with oil and salt
At 9:30 in the morning they did not have crushed tomatoes
The dry, unpleasant man,"
ChIJM_ligUYpQg0RAhHxqhcbl4Y,1,"It would have to be called the joy of the garden.
The 2 waiters who are there in the afternoon exude sympathy.
Long faces and very unfriendly.
And for the old and deteriorated appearance, the price of basic things is high.
I will definitely not return there."
ChIJM_ligUYpQg0RAhHxqhcbl4Y,5,"Very delicious food and good service.
Thanks team"
ChIJ3-2LWUcpQg0R1KY0iYwREvo,5,"I came on holiday with my boyfriend and I have to say of the many places we have stayed this is absolutely one of the best.
A quality that is almost no longer seen, a mix of tasty and authentic dishes.
Excellent wine and bill rightly proportionate to the quality, the environment and the location of this place.
Excellent service, waiters who pour you water when the glass is emptying so to speak."
ChIJ3-2LWUcpQg0R1KY0iYwREvo,5,Good bar-restaurant with homemade quality neighborhood food in an area where what is distilled are expensive places with abusive prices.
ChIJ3-2LWUcpQg0R1KY0iYwREvo,5,"The best place in the area to have a good lunch, highlighting the potato omelette.
Jes√∫s the waiter, a true professional, shows experience as he serves you quickly and everything is correct."
ChIJ3-2LWUcpQg0R1KY0iYwREvo,2,"Neighborhood cafe restaurant, old and outdated. Quite basic daily menu, but at a good price, so with people from the nearby offices it fills up after 2 p.m. It is a ""battle"" restaurant, half of the things on the menu are frozen and sometimes they even serve it to you that way. The service is slow, inefficient, unmotivated and with a bad face.
But there aren't many more options in the area, so it's passable if you know what to choose to eat."
ChIJ3-2LWUcpQg0R1KY0iYwREvo,5,"I ate a menu of the day, generous dishes without frills but of good quality, the tripe were very delicious, the only thing and a drawback, the potatoes, which are frozen. The menu was ‚Ç¨11, a very reasonable price.
Very attentive service and cozy atmosphere, a good room with a terrace option for ‚Ç¨1 more. Advisable."
ChIJFSMXK-4pQg0R8fHRydwV4kM,5,Top top top
ChIJFSMXK-4pQg0R8fHRydwV4kM,5,"The Puertochico Tavern in Chamart√≠n has been a discovery. I went on the recommendation of a friend and I have to say the burger was amazing. The meat was just right, juicy and full of flavor, and the bread was perfect, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The combination of ingredients was very well balanced, nothing stood out too much and everything fit together perfectly. The service was also impeccable, fast and attentive at all times. Without a doubt, a place to repeat when you feel like a good burger in Chamart√≠n."
ChIJFSMXK-4pQg0R8fHRydwV4kM,5,"Incredible!! We loved each dish the best. The mountain stew, the spectacular cachopo, the tortilla with a hat and what can we say about the desserts‚Ä¶
We will definitely repeat, we want to try the entire menu üòã"
ChIJFSMXK-4pQg0R8fHRydwV4kM,5,"The food was spectacular and the service exceptional, I wouldn't know which dish to recommend, they were all very good."
ChIJFSMXK-4pQg0R8fHRydwV4kM,1,"It was in December of last year. We ordered a kilo of beef tenderloin from the menu for dinner. They brought us four beef tenderloins on a platter with potatoes and peppers. They were extremely overcooked and I don't know if they were reheated. See photos
We told the waitress and she couldn't change it but just say I'm going to tell the cook so he knows.

He stopped by after a while to tell us how everything was and we told him the same thing: it was very dry. He told us that he was going to buy us a shot. I can't get over my astonishment. That meat along with a Finca Resalto, 2022 and a previous portion of squid or Rabas, cost two people ‚Ç¨85. I will tell the manager this when I see him. Last night I wasn't there"
ChIJbS0vRkQpQg0RP1uw7uqXdYA,3,"Good place to get lunch.
They serve a very nice fish dish."
ChIJbS0vRkQpQg0RP1uw7uqXdYA,5,"I've been a regular here for lunch with colueges, always a great food !"
ChIJbS0vRkQpQg0RP1uw7uqXdYA,4,Nice food
ChIJbS0vRkQpQg0RP1uw7uqXdYA,4,"Perfect for going for beers. Just by sitting down to have a drink, the waiters are constantly passing by with different trays of assorted tapas included in the price of what you drink.
Very large portions, maybe too large, which can be a problem because they don't allow you to order half portions. A negative point is the fact that they charge you 1 euro for bread and service. Anyway, the food is good and the staff is very nice."
ChIJbS0vRkQpQg0RP1uw7uqXdYA,4,"Good value for money. I will return. It is close to the INDIANA hotel, a 4-minute walk away."

ChIJAUDrSqspQg0RAIQjl4H01c8,1,"I wish I had read the review.
The worst ""empanadas"" in the universe.
It's inside the train station

(Hey, I didn't write this, I haven't tried these empanadas, don't look at me)"
ChIJAUDrSqspQg0RAIQjl4H01c8,2,"The Argentine empanadas, apart from being cold from the refrigerator (the filling), the cheese leaves a lot to be desired. Otherwise, the acorn-fed ham sandwich was also cold from the refrigerator, especially the bread.
Quite correct service and drinks"
ChIJAUDrSqspQg0RAIQjl4H01c8,5,Excellent product. Very good option to enjoy the trip!
ChIJAUDrSqspQg0RAIQjl4H01c8,1,What an inefficient place.
ChIJmRZMlHEpQg0RAM7aLdMPuCI,1,"The waiter (on the pic) was so rude! He didn‚Äôt greet us, he didn‚Äôt ask us what we‚Äôd like to drink or eat, and he had a bad attitude.
When I asked him whether he worked there to get the menu, he answered sarcastically ‚Äúobviously, I‚Äôm not part of the decoration.‚Äù

How rude can you be? And if you‚Äôre not part of the decor, then please go ahead and start doing your job.

I hope the manager talks to his employee about this instead of asking people to write fake positive reviews."
ChIJmRZMlHEpQg0RAM7aLdMPuCI,1,"Super rude staff, the worst I have experienced in my life. Please avoid this bar, they did not even say hello when we entered. They talked to us in a sarcastic way. When we paid they did not even say thank you. I hope the staff gets fired as soon as possible.

The beer was at least decent"
ChIJmRZMlHEpQg0RAM7aLdMPuCI,1,"Rude staff. Stopped here to kill some time waiting for train departure. We weren't very hungry so we ordered a bottle of water and some flan. After staff realized we were not ordering food for lunch, they made us lift our water and glasses so that they could remove the table cloth. They even took the napkins. They continued to be rude to us for the very short amount of time we were there ( 25 minutes)."
ChIJmRZMlHEpQg0RAM7aLdMPuCI,4,Stopped for a quick lunch. As we had a train to catch we actually shared a Menu del dia which was excellent- black rice with homemade ailioli ( very generous portion) Grilled fish and salad then homemade cr√®me caramel. Service was courteous and prompt despite being busy with local office workers. We would go back.
ChIJmRZMlHEpQg0RAM7aLdMPuCI,1,"Lasted 30 seconds in this place. Met by an aggressive guy behind the bar, who when asked in what was an admitted spanish hybrid for ""table for dos"" responded with a sweeping outward gesture with his fingers and ""I don't do Ingles""

No offer to seat us in and work round the language barrier, as every other place we've been in has done, he just dismissed us. This despite him having a pretty empty restaurant at what was an early hour for Dinner in Madrid (1815).

Unless your Spanish is up to speed, this place should be avoided."
ChIJSbZcuUgpQg0RcxazIn5PkmQ,5,"Traditional small neighborhood restaurant with very good food, more than reasonable prices and very kind staff."
ChIJSbZcuUgpQg0RcxazIn5PkmQ,5,"Delicious and very friendly staff, we will be back!"
ChIJSbZcuUgpQg0RcxazIn5PkmQ,1,"We went to drink something one Saturday night around 11.30pm, the waiter at the beginning said there was no problems. We sat down at one tablet, asked him ti clean It, but then he fed up and told us it was too late (even if there were people still eating and we were in 3 just for a small beer). I will never come back again. It's plenty of places where to go to eat or drink."
ChIJSbZcuUgpQg0RcxazIn5PkmQ,5,"Traditional Spanish restaurant, with a great atmosphere.  Andr√©s and his family are a class act, and always make you feel at home.  The padr√≥n peppers and cheese plate are a must."
ChIJSbZcuUgpQg0RcxazIn5PkmQ,5,"Great food, friendly and welcoming staff!"
ChIJ__9vv0gpQg0RGv0IvpgrIOQ,5,Amazing place! Food is so delicious and owner is the best! If you love Margherita it‚Äôs the best place! Love it!
ChIJ__9vv0gpQg0RGv0IvpgrIOQ,5,Lovely little place on the corner... simply perfect üòÅüòâ
ChIJ__9vv0gpQg0RGv0IvpgrIOQ,3,Slow service. Food is just ok but pricey.  The tacos al pastor have nothing to do with the real ones...and also no pineapple on them.
ChIJ__9vv0gpQg0RGv0IvpgrIOQ,4,"They have a very delicious nachos, tacos and fajitas.
The only thing may bothers is that the terrace is small and it gets crowded and people smoke."
ChIJ__9vv0gpQg0RGv0IvpgrIOQ,3,"The food is great but it's a very small ""cantina"" with only three tables"
ChIJ5VQMOgApQg0RJlhuyIc6vEQ,4,"Quiet, good food on the go"

ChIJ5VQMOgApQg0RJlhuyIc6vEQ,4,"Although it may be a bit strange here, I have noticed that the flavor of the colacao and the pastries that the snack includes is somewhat different from the rest of the franchise's locations. The guy who helped us was super friendly. The piece of chocolate cake we ordered was delicious. We will come here more often"
ChIJX4AWfcYpQg0RsxT6UzSxrvw,5,"I stayed in the nearby hotel and decided to try this restaurant. I'm glad I did. I had entrecote, which is rib eye steak, and it was delicious. I really enjoyed my meal so I  returned the next day and had burger. It was nice and big. Also, Dani who works at the restaurant is a superstar: he's very nice and friendly."
ChIJX4AWfcYpQg0RsxT6UzSxrvw,5,"I went a few days ago for dinner. I really liked the food, we tried the grilled vegetables, the fried eggs with ham, the fried anchovies and the squids. We were very comfortable and very well looked after by a very young waitress who was especially nice to us. She tried to please us at all times. We will repeat!"
ChIJX4AWfcYpQg0RsxT6UzSxrvw,3,Disappointed. Went because of the excellent reviews. Good staff and service. But overall disappointed. A number of things we wanted to order they didn't have. And the gambas we did order - they came in a very hot dish but the actual prawns were very cold and inedible. The provolone also took a very long time to arrive. Not all bad. The croquetas were very good. The tomato salad was good too. Maybe we were unlucky but overall not a great meal.
ChIJX4AWfcYpQg0RsxT6UzSxrvw,5,"Good music, great service, amazing food. I had the shrimp casserole, the antrecot, and the cheesecake.  They were all perfection.  Higly recommended."
ChIJX4AWfcYpQg0RsxT6UzSxrvw,5,We came by for lunch from a nearby hotel and the food here was excellent. The staff was very friendly and efficient. I would highly recommend this place for lunch.
ChIJiXj0_yEpQg0RLpAYEI7jz5U,5,"Lovely place, lovely coffee and lovely carrot cake. I took a classic one and the sweetness is just perfect. Strongly recommend this place!"
ChIJiXj0_yEpQg0RLpAYEI7jz5U,5,We really liked the atmosphere and the desserts. We tried the chocolate cake and the cacao carrot cake. They were both very tasty and the coffee was good too. They have a wheelchair accessible bathroom (accessible through a side entrance. Everything was clean. They also make sugarless and gluten-free cakes if they are ordered in advance. A big plus! Very friendly staff!
ChIJiXj0_yEpQg0RLpAYEI7jz5U,5,Easily the best Carrot Cake I‚Äôve ever had. We came here for a treat and it was worth the drive. The service was fantastic and the portions are huge. Great coffee too. Enjoy
ChIJiXj0_yEpQg0RLpAYEI7jz5U,4,"Wide choice of carrot cake, cheesecake and other American cakes.
Big portions and very good quality.
Very good coffee.
Slightly overpriced."
ChIJiXj0_yEpQg0RLpAYEI7jz5U,5,"Nice vibe and good variety of pastries for a neighborhood cafe.

ChIJ2660tRYpQg0RPM298sQz2eA,5,Top place to go eat drink and a great host
ChIJ2660tRYpQg0RPM298sQz2eA,5,For me the best Pizza what i have eat in the World. Tuna Pizza very very good.
ChIJ2660tRYpQg0RPM298sQz2eA,2,"Lousy food. The frozen and raw croquettes, the regular bravas, the large hard ones. Very friendly waiters. To have a good beer."
ChIJ2660tRYpQg0RPM298sQz2eA,5,"Highly recommended Bar Restaurant.
If you want to have a very cold Mahou, this is the ideal place. The tapas are abundant and good. The portions and burgers are very well priced and of quality.
The treatment received has been pleasant and familiar.
We will surely repeat!"

ChIJ19mX1yApQg0RSkyl4Ltk6PM,5,I like to order there set poke. It tastes good.
ChIJ19mX1yApQg0RSkyl4Ltk6PM,5,"I mean, the ideal place, the most beautiful girl, the unbeatable attention, the very good quality, the presentation of 12 and the quantity without words, we have never eaten a bowl like this. We will return to Madrid and we will stop by to say hello and eat for sure."
ChIJ19mX1yApQg0RSkyl4Ltk6PM,5,"Super healthy food and rich in flavor, perfect for athletes and for all those who take care of themselves. You can even choose the ingredients to your liking and combine them!
I will definitely eat here again, 100% recommended. Very friendly service, the place is clean and modern."
ChIJ19mX1yApQg0RSkyl4Ltk6PM,5,"Poke lunch Monday through Friday, daily. I can say that I have tried almost all of them. And I enjoyed this one very much, I would repeat it without a doubt. Excellent..."
ChIJ19mX1yApQg0RSkyl4Ltk6PM,5,"22Beautiful place, super chill cozy, the girl is very nice and super attentive. Of the thousands I have eaten, it is the most aesthetically beautiful and what can I say about the quantity. We have been super delighted."
ChIJUUQqRUwpQg0R5akvfTcsh1w,5,"The food is tasty, freshly prepared and authentic. Variety of options are available. Service and ambience also nice.Its value for money."
ChIJUUQqRUwpQg0R5akvfTcsh1w,2,"After reading highly rated reviews and many recommendation from friends visited this neighbourhood place for Valentine's day dinner. The food was more average and mediocre.

We have had Chinese food at various place, but we find the dishes highly oily. The fried rice was cooked in a rice similar to paella rice and the Pad Thai noddle would have needed a minute more of cooking. The dumplings and the spring rolls were good.

The service was welcoming, but however much was lost in the translation from Chinese accented Spanish and English accented Spanish."
ChIJUUQqRUwpQg0R5akvfTcsh1w,1,"Unfriendly camarera , i had to put leftover myself in a tupper!"
ChIJUUQqRUwpQg0R5akvfTcsh1w,1,"The food was good, but unfortunately can‚Äôt go back after watching a waiter going to the bathroom next to me, and exiting without washing his hands‚Ä¶"
ChIJUUQqRUwpQg0R5akvfTcsh1w,4,"Very nice place to have lunch on working days, a bit overcrowded but it is to be expected since the food is really worth the menu cost of 12‚Ç¨. Highly recommended."
ChIJKfCGeE4pQg0RpaMZI_-HeuU,3,"Sadly we arrived at 15:50, and they told us that the kitchen will close at 16:00, so we need to order quick. But after we ordered, they told that we can eat only some cold food. Than we get ""tortilla"" (potato+eggs), russian salad and ham. So this was negative for us. But for this we payed more than 30 euro."
ChIJKfCGeE4pQg0RpaMZI_-HeuU,5,Great service and quality. Need to make reservation as its usually busy
ChIJKfCGeE4pQg0RpaMZI_-HeuU,5,"Amazing cozy place!!!!!!
Luis the owner is great person with an incredible customer satisfaction approach.
He knows how to treat everyone,  always going the extra mile for the customer.
Draft beer is serviced perfectly done!!!!!
And the food is delicious,  one magical touch from El Barrilon's kitchen.... AMAZING!!!!
Nothing fancy neither complicated, simply perfect if you wanna try something different.
And the prices are right."
ChIJKfCGeE4pQg0RpaMZI_-HeuU,4,"I'll say it's a fine place to sit down and eat something. But don't expect it to be a culinary experience. The food quality is a 3* max, but the fact they have outside seating and friendly staff bumps it up to 4*."
ChIJKfCGeE4pQg0RpaMZI_-HeuU,5,"First time in Madrid. First place I stopped for a beer and a platter of jamon, chorizo on toast. Did not disappoint."
ChIJ7yEAbLMuQg0RuEBjYdodCuo,4,"Awesome foods ,, nice service,,, nice prices"
ChIJ7yEAbLMuQg0RuEBjYdodCuo,3,"I have ordered the roast chicken several times and it has always been very good. We usually order potatoes and something else to accompany it.
As I said, the chicken was very good, but on several occasions you could tell that the potatoes were not fresh and were really stale.
I hope they correct it."
ChIJ7yEAbLMuQg0RuEBjYdodCuo,5,"A spectacle, the food and the attention!!! From the suckling pig at the end of the year, the paellas on Sundays, and the variety of food!!! Everything excellent!!!!"
ChIJ7yEAbLMuQg0RuEBjYdodCuo,1,"Both the paella and the tortilla come bathed in oil, the tortilla is bland and the potato is hard, the croquettes are cold inside, terrible food"
ChIJ7yEAbLMuQg0RuEBjYdodCuo,2,"We usually order chickens at home in Cody and we like the chicken a lot but, the last 2 times we have ordered, the bakery potatoes have arrived crumbled and bathed in oil... please keep this in mind so that it does not become the norm because the truth is that they are ready to be thrown away and it is stopping us from wanting to continue ordering food there!

I edit my review and maintain what I had written... This week we gave it another chance: it took 1.5 hours to bring the order and the chicken arrived quite dry although edible but the fact is that the potatoes were inedible, they were from the previous day for sure, we had to throw them away. With so much supply of chickens at home, we will not continue buying them here."
ChIJbyoCV1IpQg0RAFMAzxZAWXs,3,"An 'American Diner' style Chinese restaurant serving Japanese food. It's aimed at providing a quick bite for before or after movie goers. The service is friendly and efficient, but the food was average. I recommend the sweet and sour pork, and not much else. The price is average and the menu has many options to choose from."
ChIJbyoCV1IpQg0RAFMAzxZAWXs,2,"My experience at this place was not good. We went to buy a takeaway directly from the place, and when we got home we discovered that all the sushi they gave us had been cooked for a long time. The tuna was in poor condition  and the rice and the rest of the sushi was completely dry and tasteless. Avoid this place because they don't care about quality."
ChIJbyoCV1IpQg0RAFMAzxZAWXs,5,Love their egg fried rice and chicken fried rice. Crispy chicken is a must try.
ChIJbyoCV1IpQg0RAFMAzxZAWXs,3,Cozy & very clean place and welcoming staff.
ChIJbyoCV1IpQg0RAFMAzxZAWXs,5,Perfect for work lunch. Try the menus: both quantity and quality are amazing!!
ChIJb6oNZVIpQg0RkIHcuCrdmBA,4,Good place for a quick bite
ChIJb6oNZVIpQg0RkIHcuCrdmBA,1,"Terrible service, only one rude girl attending both Rodilla and Yogurteria. We queued in yogurteria for 10 minutes without being attended (she saw us and said nothing), when I went to the Rodilla queue to ask why were not being attended, she just said that she was too busy to attend Yogurteria. I will not ever try to eat there, VIPS is across the aisle and a much better option."
ChIJb6oNZVIpQg0RkIHcuCrdmBA,4,Service and product quality as expected in any other restaurant from the franchise.  However it has a very convenient location just beside the Cinema
ChIJb6oNZVIpQg0RkIHcuCrdmBA,5,"In general, a good place to order a coffee or a snack. Depending on the day, customer service improves or not. In case you meet a blonde boy, he is a real crack, fast, attentive, and kind. There is another one that is very slow, and has a hard time preparing the coffee. The downside is that it opens very late, and we cannot order coffee first thing in the morning, before going to work."
ChIJb6oNZVIpQg0RkIHcuCrdmBA,1,"We went on a Friday night for sandwiches for dinner and there was no variety or quantity left. We are talking about a Friday night, not a weekday when I understand that the spare parts will run out sooner. In short, not to return."
ChIJb6oNZVIpQg0RhJBXIYXNZHs,3,"Google Maps says they are open from 13:00 on a Monday, but it‚Äôs not true. I suggested an edit in Google Maps, let‚Äôs see if it changes. I waited and waited for them to open at 20:00‚Ä¶‚Ä¶they finally opened the restaurant at 20:04. The correct opening hours are in my photos. Staff didn‚Äôt seem to care that people are misled

Menu is in English but waiters don‚Äôt know the language. One waiter must have very bad eyesight, because to read the menu he had to put it up close to his face. Bit weird

Onion rings arrived within minutes of ordering - cooked in an air fryer? Anyhow, I was the only customer so I wouldn‚Äôt expect to wait too long. Food was tasty to be honest, I wasn‚Äôt expecting it so I was pleasantly surprised

The waiter forgot to provide the sauces and he forgot to give me wipes to clean hands after ribs. Seems they were not ready for diners. A customer shouldn‚Äôt need to ask

Service was average. Prices were too high in my opinion

Experience was okay, but I won‚Äôt be in a hurry to go back"
ChIJb6oNZVIpQg0RhJBXIYXNZHs,5,Food was super good. Didn‚Äôt expect it to be good. Just didn‚Äôt like the fries.
ChIJb6oNZVIpQg0RhJBXIYXNZHs,5,"Perfect place to eat, they have menu in english, good prices and very nice waitress. I recomened that also for kids. They have kids menu and something to play with."
ChIJb6oNZVIpQg0RhJBXIYXNZHs,1,"Horrible horrible service, two hours to bring food , and an extra 30 min to pay"
ChIJb6oNZVIpQg0RhJBXIYXNZHs,4,"A nice environment to go with friends. Food is really tasteful, but unhealthy. Few options to eat without meat. Bacon & cheese fries are mandatory, and all the burgers are incredibly delicious. Chocolate and carrot cakes for dessert are a good recommendation. Staff people are very kind and funny."
ChIJKy0Mh1EpQg0R2Xn9kUUkTeQ,4,Excellent salad bar for less than 4 euros and amazing selection of medium size baguettes sandwiches
ChIJKy0Mh1EpQg0R2Xn9kUUkTeQ,3,"Thank goodness I decided to open the sandwich before taking a bite. 7 euros for a secret sandwich with a questionable state of health. It is evident that this meat has been exposed to the elements for hours. It is worrying that the person who prepared it has not realized that this meat cannot be served to anyone.

Update
------------------------
I raise the original score from 1 to 3 because the business has been concerned and has offered a means of compensation for the inconvenience."
ChIJKy0Mh1EpQg0R2Xn9kUUkTeQ,2,"It's a real shame because it's close to home, the price is right and in our experience the quality of the ingredients is good. The only problem with this place is the staff that works there, one day I made a pre-order by phone to pick it up, when we went to pick it up (at the time they had indicated to us) they had not made one of the sandwiches because they had forgotten what it was (the girl's exact words) and they made us wait another 10 minutes to do it. On another occasion we ordered there personally and after waiting about 20 minutes they had made a mistake in both sandwiches and had put the croquettes in the fryer without being hot so they gave us the croquettes destroyed and still cold inside. This place urgently needs to change staff."
ChIJKy0Mh1EpQg0R2Xn9kUUkTeQ,1,"I bought through to good to go, paid 4 euros for a value according to them of 12 euros and they gave me a measly salad that I make better at home.
If you decide to enter a platform in which you commit to providing a service at least, do not profit and deceive the consumer.
I have been using the application for years and this is the first time I have seen a business that takes advantage and uses something that is intended to prevent food from being thrown away."
ChIJKy0Mh1EpQg0R2Xn9kUUkTeQ,1,"If you order by glovo in a first order they forget half of the order, and in the second I make since anyone makes a mistake.
They put my loin in bad condition, with a bad smell and bad taste... but if they charge you for it... everything is bad"
ChIJD1QDt1IpQg0RXEPZePxbLK0,4,"Great place to have breakfast and lunch, good prices, efficient personnel, even when crowded the waiting time is short. The food is good."
ChIJD1QDt1IpQg0RXEPZePxbLK0,5,"This place is a hidden gem, everything was tasty and the employees were super nice.. thank you all!"
ChIJD1QDt1IpQg0RXEPZePxbLK0,5,Great spot. Good lunch menu that you can get to go. Friendly staff!
ChIJD1QDt1IpQg0RXEPZePxbLK0,5,Very good location and very good food
ChIJD1QDt1IpQg0RXEPZePxbLK0,5,"Triple B place: Good, Beautiful and Cheap, very delicious daily menu that can be finished with roast chicken. They serve you quickly and are very friendly. You also have takeaway for a very low price."
ChIJoZUcu0wpQg0RYrxlC8i69G0,5,Really good Cocido. Worth trying.
ChIJoZUcu0wpQg0RYrxlC8i69G0,4,"Great tapas.  Nice atmosphere,  not a lot off traffic but next to cars parked.
I have only tried terrace and tapas,  attentive service."
ChIJoZUcu0wpQg0RYrxlC8i69G0,4,"The Saturday menu is highly recommended, very reasonable price for the quality of the food, especially the seconds.
Menu of the day and menu during the week to snack on something also delicious.
Delicious cooked and very good value for money compared to what other restaurants offer.
Sometimes the attention and treatment of some of the waiters could be improved."
ChIJoZUcu0wpQg0RYrxlC8i69G0,5,"It is one of the restaurants where you can eat the best in the Pinar de Chamart√≠n area. They have a highly recommended menu of the day, although the price is somewhat high, the quality deserves it and there is another bar menu with a very reasonable price. The most expensive drinks.
Delicious and quality food. The waiters and all the staff are very friendly and attentive.
The Menu of the day is rich and varied. The potato omelette is delicious. Possibility of eating √† la carte during the week or snacking.
The Cocido is spectacular and very good value for money compared to what other restaurants offer.
The price of the drinks is somewhat expensive... Coca-Cola 3.40, beers 3.50... I see it as somewhat excessive."
ChIJoZUcu0wpQg0RYrxlC8i69G0,5,"Come in for a beer.
I loved it! They have different types of beer! And I found the one I wanted!
The attention was 10
With appetizer (two tapas, tortilla and olives)"
ChIJDTOEOEkpQg0REal45MYiAPQ,2,"A bit overpriced to be fair. Good tapas and good food quality though.

But still they‚Äôre charging you 4ish for 1/3 which is excessive to me, and I‚Äôm living in the most expensive city in the world."
ChIJDTOEOEkpQg0REal45MYiAPQ,4,"Very pleasant place to visit. The food is great and especially the tortilla.

The service was ok but nothing special, hence 4 stars."
ChIJDTOEOEkpQg0REal45MYiAPQ,4,Food is delicious. Try the red wine with lemon.  I am visiting from the US and this is my favorite Tapas so far.
ChIJDTOEOEkpQg0REal45MYiAPQ,5,Great service... perfect for enjoying the company of friends and family.
ChIJDTOEOEkpQg0REal45MYiAPQ,5,"Very good service, quality food, nice place."
ChIJU86_jRMpQg0RT-eudJoSSjg,4,"Very delicious and successful Argentine empanadas. They have something for all tastes (spicy, not spicy, with meat, cheese, etc.). Very convenient to take assorted boxes to dinner or to someone's house and heat them in the oven! The boxes are very resistant and do not crush or get dirty. They seemed a little expensive to us, but they were very delicious. We really liked the soft chicken and suckling pig. A nice addition to the Pinar de Chamart√≠n neighborhood!"
ChIJU86_jRMpQg0RT-eudJoSSjg,5,"The shop assistant in the mornings is charming, the cocinita pibil empanadilla is 100% recommended, the spicy chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãone is also very tasty, the offer of 2 empanadas and a soft drink for six euros or so is very very accurate, quality at a good price."
ChIJU86_jRMpQg0RT-eudJoSSjg,5,"the best empanadas I have tried in all of Spain üá™üá∏
The service was excellent, they have an incredible variety of flavors and they were all delicious, I will definitely return ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChIJU86_jRMpQg0RT-eudJoSSjg,1,"It's not worth it. On two occasions I have booked through the To go to go app, and on two occasions they have canceled the order. There will be no more"
ChIJU86_jRMpQg0RT-eudJoSSjg,3,"The empanadas are incredible. Very very good.
But BE CAREFUL, don't drink coffee. I was served a coffee with milk that was clearly in poor condition. The milk is granulated with a fatal texture and with its consequent discomfort after drinking it. If the milk is in bad condition, they should NOT be served. With the naked eye you can see it.
I insist, the empanadas 10/10, the service is very good, but the coffee milk thing seems against the ethics of a food business."
ChIJxf7W20spQg0Rt80FNXO-3tE,4,"Would recommend a walk from Hotel Nuevo Madrid to have lovely food, Hose can speak good English for those who don't speak Spanish."
ChIJxf7W20spQg0Rt80FNXO-3tE,4,"A wide range of products, excellent service and cheaper."
ChIJxf7W20spQg0Rt80FNXO-3tE,5,Ok
ChIJxf7W20spQg0Rt80FNXO-3tE,5,Ok
ChIJxf7W20spQg0Rt80FNXO-3tE,5,"Good service and atmosphere, the tortilla skewer was very good. At breakfast, I always ordered toast with tomato and oil, they add the tomato, which I wouldn't do because everyone has their own taste and wants more or less. Coffee of 10."
ChIJP_qeIdYuQg0R-Mn-TUOjQok,1,"This place is a must visit to see how NOT to treat your paying customers, how not to prepare food and how not to run a restaurant. Sure it might look ok, and even on occasions busy, but don't be fooled, the reception is cold, stone cold, as is the majority of the fare emerging from the kitchen. Dare to complain? Go for it and you'll be chided and dehumanized, and don't be a non-native either, as the elderly waiter/proprietor/ward orderly will scoff at you and remind you that 70 years ago people like you would be stood against the wall... you get the gist...all with a chuckle and fond longing for the return of past glories. This place has not evolved since the 1930s, neither in terms of service ethos nor style of cuisine. If the food of oppression and disdain is your delight, fill yer boots!"
ChIJP_qeIdYuQg0R-Mn-TUOjQok,1,"Bad coffee with sour milk. A very sweet waitress but that‚Äôs about it. Also, personal pet peeve is the presence of gambling machines where locals are allowed to throw away money while the machine rattles off the same, obnoxious encouragement to keep going."
ChIJP_qeIdYuQg0R-Mn-TUOjQok,1,I had the most disgusting experience in a restaurant. Too expensive for the quality they offer and really rude service. NOT RECOMMENDED even if you are starving.
ChIJP_qeIdYuQg0R-Mn-TUOjQok,5,Had dinner and breakfast on the next morning and food was excellent. The service from the guy on the bar was friendly and helpful. Excellent customer service.
ChIJP_qeIdYuQg0R-Mn-TUOjQok,3,"Ok  . Jam√≥n is not the greatest and a bit pricey but close to sol, air a."
ChIJK4j1KQApQg0RAvqCX5QaayA,1,"I had been on the terrace and it had seemed pleasant to me but today in the Restaurant it was a real disaster. Attractive menu but they didn't have some dishes, they didn't have a wine list and the one we ordered was very expensive. (for a wine of 8.5 euros they charged us 22) The bread was frozen and took a while to arrive. Little and bad service. Let's go so as not to repeat."
ChIJK4j1KQApQg0RAvqCX5QaayA,3,"Restaurant belonging to the Pinar Plaza hotel, in Pinar de Chamartin.
It has a long terrace, pleasant when the sun shines.
You have the option of an appetizer with a short menu or eating at the restaurant, with several starters, 4 fish and 4 meats."
ChIJK4j1KQApQg0RAvqCX5QaayA,2,"A shame about the place. Well decorated, good dishes, terrible service, slow and not very proactive. I've eaten here three or four times and probably won't go back. You can wait hours for the dishes to arrive on the table. No one takes away your 2.5 or 3 hours. A shame."
ChIJK4j1KQApQg0RAvqCX5QaayA,5,"A very good experience, the food is very delicious and despite not having a long menu, there is something for all tastes.
The service was 10, very friendly and very good recommendations for both wines and food. I will repeat without a doubt."
ChIJK4j1KQApQg0RAvqCX5QaayA,1,"Tiny and terrible food, terrible service, I ask what dessert means and they tell me cr√®me br√ªl√©e and they serve me an inedible chocolate bun. the worst quality price in the area."
ChIJQcfzbEwpQg0RHtwJ1yWx0zY,1,these people cheated me; wildly overcharged ... my ONLY bad experience in Madrid!
ChIJQcfzbEwpQg0RHtwJ1yWx0zY,4,"Nice little cozy restaurant.
The food is varied: fish,  burgers, salads, meats.
The beer is a little bit expensive 3.5 eris the mug."
ChIJQcfzbEwpQg0RHtwJ1yWx0zY,5,Great local place to go out! Nice pricing and friendly staff.
ChIJQcfzbEwpQg0RHtwJ1yWx0zY,5,Great service and tasty tapas!
ChIJQcfzbEwpQg0RHtwJ1yWx0zY,4,Friendly staff
ChIJ64GDy4kpQg0RdiK8mBniF_U,1,"I'm very dissatisfied, they try to have a level (which the food has) but I spend 70 minutes waiting for a steak when in total we have paid 200 euros on account, it doesn't seem normal to me."
ChIJG1Jle0wpQg0RqBnG64K-RKQ,5,They are kind. I like the place.
ChIJG1Jle0wpQg0RqBnG64K-RKQ,5,"Est√° muy bien, es el t√≠pico bar de toda la vida, de batalla. Lo llevan unos chinos.
Estupendo para tomar algo, para comer sales del paso muy dignamente. Hacen buenos bocadillos tambi√©n.
Recomendable!"
ChIJG1Jle0wpQg0RqBnG64K-RKQ,5,"Briefly: I am a fan of potato omelette, which in Madrid is generally a disaster. This is the best I have found, superior to other more famous sites. The croquettes are also especially good, as is the Russian salad. The rest as average or better.

02/17/22 Although it has changed owners, the omelette is still exceptional and the salad is great. I haven't seen those croquettes before.

12/19/23 The last two times I have gone, including yesterday, the omelette was far from being as good as it was. Will the same cook continue?"
ChIJG1Jle0wpQg0RqBnG64K-RKQ,5,"Breakfast, rich lunch, 7 to 12.5‚Ç¨, various drinks in the evening"
ChIJG1Jle0wpQg0RqBnG64K-RKQ,1,"We have gone for breakfast on 2 different days and each day they raised the prices. Also, the tortilla skewer and the toast are nothing to write home about. I won't even be invited back."
ChIJA_K97YUpQg0RVbhcDLuUnCA,5,"Out of most of the places I‚Äôve been in Madrid, this small place stands very tall in my list of places to eat. The have amazing attention with the food service, daily rotating dishes. The staff is very kind and friendly. I highly recommend it."
ChIJA_K97YUpQg0RVbhcDLuUnCA,5,"Excellent authentic Spanish restaurant in local neighborhood close to Pinar Chamart√≠n metro.  I had the lunch menu with tortellini starters, and beef fillet. With bread, drink and dessert it all came to ‚Ç¨13 which is an amazing deal. Service was fast and friendly  and everything was incredibly delicious. Highly recommended."
ChIJA_K97YUpQg0RVbhcDLuUnCA,5,Very friendly
ChIJA_K97YUpQg0RVbhcDLuUnCA,5,"Mes√≥n Pepe is one of those places where you eat well, quickly and without complications. The daily menu is great, with homemade dishes that change depending on the day and more than generous portions. Everything has that taste of home cooked food, no nonsense but well done, which leaves you more than satisfied.

Nice waiters and friendly treatment, as if they had known you all their lives. If you are looking for a place to eat delicious and cheap during the week, this place more than fits the bill."
ChIJA_K97YUpQg0RVbhcDLuUnCA,5,"Good place, quiet, with a good parking area, with a good dining room, whether at a high table or a normal one, whichever one you like best with a good menu, and a daily menu with homemade food that was delicious. Dani's attention was great, super polite and with his smile that was not lacking. Quick service from both you and the kitchen."
ChIJ9Q90buEpQg0RETG1RxVkYmQ,3,"Had a Taquitos de Solomillo with Fries. Generally meet was very good a taste. Staff friendly, English speaking. The taste of the fries was very bad, feels like too much oil. I would recommend removing oil fries and baking them as it reminds me of a McDonald's. The interior is genial! Nice please to see."
ChIJ9Q90buEpQg0RETG1RxVkYmQ,5,"One of my essentials in Madrid.
The gastronomy is exquisite, the staff treatment is unsurpassed, and something that for me gives it a unique touch is the wonderful winery they have, with a wine for every occasion.
Congratulations to the entire team. 10/10"
ChIJ9Q90buEpQg0RETG1RxVkYmQ,5,"Very good place to enjoy the best food you can find around. Cristian, the manager, treated us as if we were at home. An unbeatable place to enjoy one of the best restaurants in Pinar de Chamart√≠n."
ChIJ9Q90buEpQg0RETG1RxVkYmQ,5,"One of the best in the Arturo Soria area.
Excellent croquettes and rows.
The meats are crazy and well done.
Ideal for having a drink after eating."
ChIJ9Q90buEpQg0RETG1RxVkYmQ,3,"We had read that they were slow and expensive and this is confirmed. They charge for service, which they shouldn't, and the drinks are at excessive prices.
The food was delicious, although my dish arrived cold because they waited to take it out at the same time as others. Maybe they were slow because there were Christmas meals"
ChIJQ9sCYmQpQg0RgMe3WpD4ti8,1,"me and my partner would like to have something to drink. We ask for . drink menu , he answer is not available. okay? I go in, he points to the shelf and both who work there laugh at me. not good , do not understand that it is a good rating ???"
ChIJQ9sCYmQpQg0RgMe3WpD4ti8,5,"The menus are excellent. In addition to having a great menu. I recommend the grilled octopus and black rice.
Great service"
ChIJQ9sCYmQpQg0RgMe3WpD4ti8,1,"Frozen meals, bagged salad.  The cook ran off to do some shopping after taking our order.
Don't waste money unnecessarily in this restaurant. Do like them, run away."
ChIJQ9sCYmQpQg0RgMe3WpD4ti8,5,"A very nice place, good terrace and very friendly, very professional waiters. He recommends going to eat typical Moroccan food and grilled meat, everything is good."
ChIJQ9sCYmQpQg0RgMe3WpD4ti8,5,"Excellent restaurant, economical menus, good portion menu, friendly and very attentive waiters."
ChIJNw9bpE8pQg0RTOBsZjtW4YY,1,"Over priced, very rude staff (and manager) and extremely bad food. The Salmon was filled with water, the burger was not cooked, the tuna ‚Äúsalad‚Äù was just a can of tuna on top of some old tomatoes. Your money is better spent elsewhere :)"
ChIJNw9bpE8pQg0RTOBsZjtW4YY,5,"Hotel restaurant that surprised me with its quality-price ratio.
Very friendly staff and quick service, even with the place full the times are acceptable.
The dishes on the menu are not Michelin, but I must say that they are very well prepared, successful combinations and everything is always on point. Jos√©, the cook knows what he does.
I have spent 10 days in the hotel and eating there daily, I couldn't be happier."
ChIJNw9bpE8pQg0RTOBsZjtW4YY,5,"Pleasant surprise! Surprising for a hotel restaurant.

We ate anchovies, a Russian salad, followed by hake in its green sauce, entrec√¥te and a chocolate coulant to finish. All dishes were good and well cooked. All the staff are very friendly and attentive."
ChIJNw9bpE8pQg0RTOBsZjtW4YY,2,"You cannot serve a burger worth ‚Ç¨18 with mediocre fries and Prima brand kepchup and mustard. What less than putting quality Heinz or Hellman's and potatoes in good condition and not half broken and small. The meat to be beef, nothing out of this world."
ChIJNw9bpE8pQg0RTOBsZjtW4YY,4,Comida e servi√ßo de qualidade. Vale o pre√ßo.
ChIJKXKWWrApQg0RHo-dmL9MHNA,5,"Amazing place.
Very warm people.
Great food.
Very authentic place."
ChIJKXKWWrApQg0RHo-dmL9MHNA,1,"The owner who responds to messages absolutely cannot control his language. Bad food, bad service, I don't recommend anyone to come here and ruin their mood. It's a shame because I live just two minutes away from you"
ChIJKXKWWrApQg0RHo-dmL9MHNA,4,"It was between 3 and 4 stars. The site is a bit narrow. There weren't many people and they placed the few customers there were at adjacent tables. At our table they didn't sing the off card, but at the other they did, we don't know the reason. In any case, the portion of artichokes is made up of two artichokes (for the price I expected a little more), while the average mojama is six pieces with oil (not extra virgin)."
ChIJKXKWWrApQg0RHo-dmL9MHNA,5,"Truly spectacular food, one of the best I've had in Madrid. Incredible quality. Perfect service, cozy and authentic place. Totally recommended for eating and a good after-dinner meal with friends!"
ChIJKXKWWrApQg0RHo-dmL9MHNA,5,"One of the best restaurants to eat at!!.. the quality of the product is brutal. Fernando is a genius, he pays attention to detail to the millimeter."
ChIJC4Hdi2cpQg0RWX2rzoCCaus,2,"Clean and nice staff.
Cons:
1. Too hot, no air conditioning.
2. No straws, but there are plastic cover for the cups..(so you can offer paper straws for your customers).
3. The self order machine via the app is not user friendly. But its not related to the branch, but to the whole chain."
ChIJC4Hdi2cpQg0RWX2rzoCCaus,5,"Clean and lively crowd always there, families are hanging out on the front lawn and the Rooftop."
ChIJC4Hdi2cpQg0RWX2rzoCCaus,3,"Food is average, like any other McDonals in the World. It does what it has to do...
But this particular restaurant was a bit disappointing.
First, there were not napkins and, when asked, I just got a couple of them. But they don't even bother to refill the dispenser...
Second, it was very dirty with food and papers on the floor and many tables not yet cleaned.
My impression was thar there were not enough people to attend.
At that time there were just three and they were overwhelmed."
ChIJC4Hdi2cpQg0RWX2rzoCCaus,3,The place cloud be a little bit cleaner. The food is as expected.
ChIJC4Hdi2cpQg0RWX2rzoCCaus,5,"Good and fast service, very hospitable staff."
ChIJxdQdKBomQg0Rq0un8R10rxI,4,"This is a great choice if you want to taste truly Asturian flavours.

They offer a daily lunch menu, that is a good value offering.  Please be sure you're hungry enough, portions are generous and staff often challenge you for an extra bite, they don't like to see any left overs"
ChIJxdQdKBomQg0Rq0un8R10rxI,4,"good food but i think they have a cheap dishwasher since most of the glasses, cuttlery, and plates arent fully clean."
ChIJxdQdKBomQg0Rq0un8R10rxI,5,Cachopo was amazing! I recommend this place for Cachopos. Make sure you share as the dish is quite big for one person.
ChIJxdQdKBomQg0Rq0un8R10rxI,5,This one of my favorite places to eat and drink in Madrid
ChIJxdQdKBomQg0Rq0un8R10rxI,5,"Great cider and decent tapas. Helps to speak Spanish, but we managed."
ChIJjagRfMcuQg0RcOQRkfx5Skw,1,Bad taste
ChIJjagRfMcuQg0RcOQRkfx5Skw,3,"They didn't take long, they said in 40 minutes (Saturday night) and they arrived in 20, fast, good. The spring roll is quite large. Bland food, we already know what Chinese restaurants are like, it's difficult to find one that does it well. It's cheap, order a kitten for ‚Ç¨9 and they give you a Chinese or prawn bread."
ChIJjagRfMcuQg0RcOQRkfx5Skw,1,"The worst Chinese restaurant we have ordered food from. Half of what they bring is pure fat that has no taste of anything and you even doubt if what you are eating is actually what you ordered. I attach an image of the supposed fried squid. Of the people we ate, some ended up with a belly ache... A regrettable experience."
ChIJjagRfMcuQg0RcOQRkfx5Skw,1,Everything disgusting. It smells even bad. Super greasy and on top of that they charge you more than what they say on their page. Horrible experience
ChIJjagRfMcuQg0RcOQRkfx5Skw,1,"The terrible home food, everything tasteless, the gyozas almost uncooked, waste of money"
ChIJPTmx8wQpQg0RhSKTnjURKAQ,5,"I eat here every day with my colleagues and we take the menu to eat at the company, it works out better than cooking at home.

It's always full, there are lines that sometimes reach the door, if it's that crowded I imagine it must be for something, and I don't think it's due to a lack of restaurant options because there are many in the area. Good, cheap and the service is very attentive, Jes√∫s the owner is charming and the waiters are wonderful.

I have to say that I have an intolerance and that there are times when I can't eat what they have and they prepare me whatever I ask for, and always smiling.

The only drawback I see is that it doesn't have home delivery ;)

Oh and the knuckle, delicious!"
ChIJPTmx8wQpQg0RhSKTnjURKAQ,3,The quality of the dishes is aligned with what you can find throughout the Manoteras industrial estate. The good thing about it is that there are enough options to organize what type of menu you want. The lounge is quite spacious so there is no problem finding a space even at rush hour.
ChIJPTmx8wQpQg0RhSKTnjURKAQ,1,"I'm calling to tell you that yesterday, in a table of 3, 2 of us ate meatloaf and we suffered food poisoning.

I imagine there will be many more intoxicated people, because the restaurant, being in an office area, was full and we saw more tables eating the same menu.

I will continue trying to contact them to communicate directly!!"
ChIJPTmx8wQpQg0RhSKTnjURKAQ,2,The day a waiter picks up a locker will be a divine miracle. With csf√© they don't even ask you how you want the milk. The oil must be given to them based on the amount they use in their dishes. And the meat is immediately synonymous with the fact that the cow is still very young.
ChIJPTmx8wQpQg0RhSKTnjURKAQ,5,THE takeaway menu is the best. The same quality as in the restaurant but two tupperware and bread for 4.50. A very competitive price
ChIJqxK_dKovQg0RCJaZbFbiwTY,4,Excellent taste and quality of food. Good price-quality ratio. 100% recommended
ChIJqxK_dKovQg0RCJaZbFbiwTY,5,"Spectacular typical Peruvian food!! How lucky to have this restaurant in the neighborhood. The quantities are very large and the food is delicious. Lots of variety on the menu. Very good service, both waiter and cook friendly and dedicated. We will repeat for sure!!"
ChIJqxK_dKovQg0RCJaZbFbiwTY,5,"They recommended it to me, it was my first time there and it was a success! Delicious food made to order. The generous portions and the unsurpassed service; like at home. I overcome my aspects. Excellent quality-price. Good, nice and cheap, the atmosphere is somewhat small but cozy. Thanks to Abel and Larry for excellent service, I will definitely repeat."
ChIJqxK_dKovQg0RCJaZbFbiwTY,5,"Truly an excellent discovery! The food; the service and the atmosphere make you feel at home; The chef came up to us to ask us how it was and we really appreciated the detail, we clearly said that everything was perfect since the flavor of each of the dishes was unbeatable. They gained some regular customers!
We will always return!
Delighted 10 out of 5"
ChIJqxK_dKovQg0RCJaZbFbiwTY,5,"Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and especially the quantity, at the price they have it it is much more than recommended. I have eaten at this place several times and all the dishes I have tried are of high quality. Very good discovery that we made when we entered the first day, we are very happy every time we go."
ChIJG-OZ2EwvQg0RkO2hXHl48pQ,5,"We ate aj√≠ de gallina, lomo saltado and mango juice. All very good and at a very good price. A discovery in the neighborhood. They have a menu of the day during the week for 12 euros, we'll definitely try it!!"
ChIJG-OZ2EwvQg0RkO2hXHl48pQ,5,I ate yesterday and the grilled chicken was very delicious 10/10
ChIJG-OZ2EwvQg0RkO2hXHl48pQ,5,"It's great, things have changed and this time they hit the nail on the head. The old reviews are now not valid for this place. I recommend everything on point and I appreciate it normally."
ChIJG-OZ2EwvQg0RkO2hXHl48pQ,2,"I ordered aji de gallina, and what arrived were two boiled potatoes, and a pile of rice. The chicken is nowhere to be found."
ChIJG-OZ2EwvQg0RkO2hXHl48pQ,5,"I was passing by here and ordered a menu and highly recommended, without many words 5 well-earned stars"
ChIJy7tAjaMvQg0RcknPlPwJmRs,4,"Great service,,, nice prices,,, good food,,,"
ChIJy7tAjaMvQg0RcknPlPwJmRs,5,Ok
ChIJy7tAjaMvQg0RcknPlPwJmRs,5,"A highly recommended site! üëå

I give it a 10/10 without hesitation. From the moment you enter, you realize the exceptional treatment of Giovanni and Sergio, who are simply the best. The attention is close and they make you feel like you belong at home from the first moment üôå

As for the food‚Ä¶ spectacular! The tapas that accompany each drink are generous and varied, a true delight that elevates the experience. But what really surprised us was the burger we had for dinner, tremendous! Juicy, well made, and with a flavor that left us delighted. And let's not talk about the cheesecake... a real delicacy! üòã

‚ÄúEl Esquinazo‚Äù is undoubtedly a mandatory stop in Manoteras-Hortaleza. Perfect to go with friends, as a couple, or even alone, because you will surely feel well cared for.

We always come back and will never stop! üíÉüèº"
ChIJy7tAjaMvQg0RcknPlPwJmRs,5,"Spectacular. Out of 10. Yesterday I tried the hamburgers and today, for a change, I tried the hot dog and it was very good. Rich, rich. We also tried the Argentine empanadillas and they were very delicious."
ChIJy7tAjaMvQg0RcknPlPwJmRs,5,"Spectacular! We had a very pleasant time, everything was very careful, it shows that they put a lot of care into their work. The tapas are very delicious and varied, and the atmosphere too, young children and adults, and on top of that we parked on the first try üòÑü•≥"
ChIJdXwk9EYvQg0RJydfTBrf1MQ,5,"Great food, very attentive service and a lovely outside terrace."
ChIJdXwk9EYvQg0RJydfTBrf1MQ,5,"100% recommended

Everything is very rich, tasty and of quality. We have ordered Russian salad, torreznos and mixed paella rice, very generous.
The attention and service is 10, attentive, very good pace and very helpful, friendly.

The terrace is worth it!!!
Both friends and family atmosphere.
Thank you"
ChIJdXwk9EYvQg0RJydfTBrf1MQ,5,"We came for the first time to have a drink and eat and we liked it a lot, the service is correct, the food is very delicious and well prepared, with the drink they always serve good tapas (black rice, cheese and sausage). The terrace is very cozy!! Acceptable prices!! We will return without a doubt!!"
ChIJdXwk9EYvQg0RJydfTBrf1MQ,5,"2 of us stopped here to eat.
The staff is friendly and helpful and very fast.
The stew with egg is very delicious.
The sea bass on the back is acceptable and well presented.
The Galician style knuckle is also very delicious.
Very delicious carrot cake.
In short to always return."
ChIJdXwk9EYvQg0RJydfTBrf1MQ,5,"One of the best restaurants in Madrid. Very very delicious food, at affordable prices. Very clean, nice place. And nice staff. I will definitely return."
ChIJM_bOry0vQg0Rdz2Oq2u-ltc,5,"Very good treatment by the woman who was at the bar, I will definitely return, there is nothing wrong here."
ChIJM_bOry0vQg0Rdz2Oq2u-ltc,5,"Close and good treatment, the food is very good. I recommend it"
ChIJM_bOry0vQg0Rdz2Oq2u-ltc,1,Very bad coffee
ChIJo2PRur8vQg0RJC5FD3Je9xw,2,
ChIJT5uQWbguQg0RxvI_VwPu6WI,5,"The treatment and kindness of Silvia and Angel is incredible. Super fresh product and very good quality/price.
The roast chicken is the best I've ever had. 200% recommended"
ChIJT5uQWbguQg0RxvI_VwPu6WI,5,The chicken is delicious and the croquettes are brutal and super well priced. They are very nice and super friendly.  We will repeat for sure!
ChIJT5uQWbguQg0RxvI_VwPu6WI,5,"The super tender chicken, the spectacular croquettes and even with this, the best are Silvia and √Ångel who couldn't be more attentive!"
ChIJT5uQWbguQg0RxvI_VwPu6WI,5,"Some excellent chickens, very soft meat. 100% recommended"
ChIJT5uQWbguQg0RxvI_VwPu6WI,5,"Super delicious chicken!!! A 10!! And a lot of sauce. Regular frozen potatoes, if I were the owner I would try other brands!"
ChIJw58GWLguQg0RNUL8DHer268,2,"It does not have universal access.
Small and dirty place.
South facing terrace.
Public attention is scarce.
The portions are small.
The place smells bad.
The toilet is locked and you have to ask for it at the bar.
Low quality."
ChIJw58GWLguQg0RNUL8DHer268,4,"After a period of closure, Tapita Del Pincho returns with excellent service and a renewed menu"
ChIJw58GWLguQg0RNUL8DHer268,5,"The waiter's attention was much better than the last time I went, as soon as we entered (we were a group of 8) the girl who was there told us with a bad face from inside the bar ""if you sit outside I'm not going to come out to serve you."" So with them we went to another place.

This was a year ago and something I hadn't been there for since then, but today it was very convenient for me to have breakfast with my daughter and I'm glad I went back in."
ChIJw58GWLguQg0RNUL8DHer268,3,"Well, I imagine the food would be good since I ordered it through Just Eat and they didn't deliver it... They said they left it at the indicated address... But it wasn't done unless we had picked it up...
They should have returned it to the restaurant if there had been a problem but they didn't.
But yes, the amount of the order was charged.
I'll pass it on to Ocu... To solve it since Just Eat says they can't do anything, that it's the restaurant's fault.... Although I don't see it that way.
Jos√©."
ChIJw58GWLguQg0RNUL8DHer268,5,"I went to try a meal in the area and in the afternoon we came across this recently opened bar. The atmosphere is very good, we had a few drinks and they gave us tapas to eat, I couldn't get enough of it anymore. In the end we extended it into the night with how much fun we were having. The owner is very friendly and the place is very well decorated. In short, 5 stars, good atmosphere, delicious food, friendly and attentive staff."
ChIJKUPte8cuQg0RntIkbNeIxH8,5,"Good afternoon, the truth is that everything is very delicious. I ordered 1 Tres Delicacies rice, 2 homemade rice, 1 sweet and sour pork, 1 beef noodles, 2 rolls, Chinese bread and ganbas bread and everything was delicious. I liked that the pork sauce was Besides, it arrived soon and everything was hot and super delicious üòã"
ChIJKUPte8cuQg0RntIkbNeIxH8,5,"I have ordered food to take home, and I have been delighted, satisfied and above all the quality of the food was very good, you can tell that it was freshly made and everything was very delicious."
ChIJKUPte8cuQg0RntIkbNeIxH8,1,"I called asking how long it would take for an order to arrive because it was already late (if it was going to take too long I wouldn't be interested in doing it) and the Chinese girl who served me, after telling me that 30-40 minutes was the estimated time, when I told her which normally have taken me 20 minutes or even less, in a very rude manner he begins to tell me to see if I think that they carry the orders by plane and why I haven't called before. What way to respond is that?? I will never order food from this place again in my life and they better have someone else answer the phone if they don't want to be left without the few customers they may continue to have, based on the reviews I'm reading that people give about this place ."
ChIJKUPte8cuQg0RntIkbNeIxH8,1,"Awful. And we have tried it twice. It took more than an hour and we called several times to complain. The noodles are disgusting, the chicken with stale lemon and tastes ""like it did days ago."" Also the delivery man without change and not even a Spanish speaker. I'm scared to see the kitchen."
ChIJKUPte8cuQg0RntIkbNeIxH8,5,"Everything is great, we always order it home (I've never been there to rate it). They already know me and always have a detail:)"
ChIJrf6Ik1ApQg0RDHl8nF4fp4I,5,"Great place to eat some good food, with a quiet atmosphere. We stayed at a hotel 2 blocks from here, and it was great for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also, they do not close in the middle of the day, so that helped a bunch."
ChIJrf6Ik1ApQg0RDHl8nF4fp4I,4,Standard VIPS food. Fast service.
ChIJrf6Ik1ApQg0RDHl8nF4fp4I,5,"Oscar was very welcoming. I landed 7 hours before in Madrid..
Club de Salmon tests good, with Alhambra. I chose salad option against fries. Overall great experience, thanks to Oscar."
ChIJrf6Ik1ApQg0RDHl8nF4fp4I,2,"Disappointing experience. The quality of service at this location has really declined. The last two times we have gone, we have been unable to order a hamburger with the gluten free option. The first time because they had run out of gluten free rolls and the second time because the grill for cooking the gluten free food was broken and needed to be repaired."
ChIJrf6Ik1ApQg0RDHl8nF4fp4I,5,"Amazing, really good store"
